Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia’s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He’s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla\'s Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla\'s Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla\'s Volatility, along with its competitors\' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap.

All currency related amount are indicated in the company\'s associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\xa0\xa0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It’s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security’s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security\'s price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security\'s price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla\'s Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock’s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I’ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm’s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla’s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla’s “difficult environment,” the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it’s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla’s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla’s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA’s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla’s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla’s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company’s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla’s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that’s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program – Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt – Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount – Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\xa01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\xa030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\xa030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\xa030, 2024 using the prior year\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

"[""Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024…\n\xa0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\xa0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK’s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \xa0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force’s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\xa0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK’s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in ‘a war for talent’.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US’ new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites ‘workforce readiness’ as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a ‘sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce’. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\xa0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump’s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure ‘security of supply’ across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US’ Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a ‘just in time’ supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\xa0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation’s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\xa0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

Through the end of October, FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \xa0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA’s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA’s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA’s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA’s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\xa0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules’ share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA’s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA’s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \xa0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA’s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen’s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas’ Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company’s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly’s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease;\xa0 Merck & Co.’s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \xa0Pfizer’s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche’s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca’s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences’ Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver’s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\xa0 Johnson & Johnson’s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche’s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024. These are: BeiGene’s Tevimbra (tislelizumab-jsgr) for treating unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; Galderma’s Nemluvio\xa0(nemolizumab-ilto) for treating prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder with itchy nodules; Hugel-Aesthetics’ Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg) for temporarily improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (i.e., so-called “frown lines”); ImmunityBio’s Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) for treating bladder cancer; and Incyte’s Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\n\nBio/Pharma’s Rising Stars: The Companies Emerging on the Industry’s Radar\nA Shortage of Inspectors Curtailing FDA Inspections: The Impact on Pharma\nA Look Ahead: Bio/Pharma’s Top Policy Issues in US Elections Aftermath\nA Strong Contract ADC Market Drives Expansions in High-Potency Manufacturing\nOne Washington Blvd., Suite 6\nRobbinsville, NJ 08691, USA\n+1-609-208-1888\nToll Free: +1-800-640-DCAT (3288)\n© 2024 DCAT | Privacy Policy\nDCAT Value Chain Insights is produced by the Drug, Chemical &\nAssociated Technologies Association, a not-for-profit business\ndevelopment association for companies engaged in the global bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing value chain.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Letâ\x80\x99s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed worldâ\x80\x99s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n â\x80\x9cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnologyâ\x80\x9d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\nâ\x80\x9cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnologyâ\x80\x9d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizerâ\x80\x99s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnsonâ\x80\x99s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTechâ\x80\x99s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to â\x80\x9cleverage Pfizerâ\x80\x99s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.â\x80\x9d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLetâ\x80\x99s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.Â\xa0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroomâ\x80\x99s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Mooreâ\x80\x99s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Modernaâ\x80\x99s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTechâ\x80\x99s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Letâ\x80\x99s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we donâ\x80\x99t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MITâ\x80\x99s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Bidenâ\x80\x99s recent announcement on cancer research.Â\xa0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright Â© 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n""]","In October 2024, the FDA approved a certain number of new drugs, of which a specific portion were biologics.

Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren\'t paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne\'s technologies - sometimes known as \'\'neurostimulation\'\' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company\'s public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson\'s Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt\'s an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson\'s using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson\'s, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson\'s, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient\'s skull!\nHere\'s where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company\'s initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne\'s technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they\'ve already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they\'re working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC\'s public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic\'s Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company\'s scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company\'s new ""artificial intelligence"" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne\'s electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa\'s successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City’s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City’s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people’s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can “surcharge,” which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the “5-year storm” or the “10-year storm.” The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called “green infrastructure.” Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released “Increasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.” In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall—Hurricanes Henri and Ida—spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement “cloudburst” management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City’s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city’s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term “green infrastructure” refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program “Bluebelts” are developed as components of New York City’s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city’s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A “cloudburst” is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city’s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site’s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City’s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city’s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency’s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \xa0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n“NASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,” said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n“We are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,” said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days — also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n“This new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people’s livelihoods and safety,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n“The data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they’re rising faster and faster,” said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency’s sea level change science team. “Having the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.”\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

"['Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia’s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n“The results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,” said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a “bleached” appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, “Prior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef’s 500-year coral record history.” \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific—a phenomenon known as El Niño. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Niño and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n“Sea surface temperatures during El Niño and La Niña events act a bit like a seesaw,” said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. “When ocean temperatures during an El Niño are higher in the eastern Pacific, they’re typically lower in the western Pacific.” \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Niño events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023–2024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short • This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). • Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. • Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. • Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. • Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1–2.5°C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. • The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. • The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 – December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 – January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. • Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. • In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. • Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. • On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% – 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. • On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% – 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. • On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. • The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. • It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. • The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer’s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS’ coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% – 30%, 12 reefs had >30% – 50% cover and four reefs had >50% – 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% – 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% – 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% – 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% – 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐ thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% – 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% – 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% – 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% – 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% – 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% –50% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22–11.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% – 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% – 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% – 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does ‘percent hard coral cover’ mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% – 10%, >10% – 30%, >30% – 50%, >50% – 75% and >75% – 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% – 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% – 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% – 10%, b) >10% – 30%, c) >30% – 50% and d) >50% – 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023–2024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths – Shallow (2–5m), Mid (7–9m) and Deep (9–12m) – and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%–50% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0–2 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2–4 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4–6 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6–8 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% – 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% – 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% – 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1–9.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2–9.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8– 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2–11.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% – 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% – 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys. Figure 6: Proportion of coral colonies not bleached, partially bleached, fully bleached, or dead across depths from in-water surveys of 36 reefs conducted by the AIMS Bleaching Response team.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4–13.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3–15.6 DHWs – cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9–11.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3–9.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% – 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% – 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the ‘shifting baseline’ syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak ‘wave’ through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring.

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023–2024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short • This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). • Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. • Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. • Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. • Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1–2.5°C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. • The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. • The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 – December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 – January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. • Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. • In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. • Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. • On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% – 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. • On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% – 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. • On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. • The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. • It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. • The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer’s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS’ coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% – 30%, 12 reefs had >30% – 50% cover and four reefs had >50% – 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% – 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% – 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% – 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% – 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐ thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% – 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% – 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% – 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% – 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% – 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% –50% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22–11.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% – 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% – 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% – 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does ‘percent hard coral cover’ mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% – 10%, >10% – 30%, >30% – 50%, >50% – 75% and >75% – 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% – 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% – 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% – 10%, b) >10% – 30%, c) >30% – 50% and d) >50% – 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023–2024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths – Shallow (2–5m), Mid (7–9m) and Deep (9–12m) – and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%–50% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0–2 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2–4 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4–6 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6–8 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1–9.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2–9.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8– 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2–11.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% – 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% – 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4–13.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3–15.6 DHWs – cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9–11.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3–9.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% – 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% – 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the ‘shifting baseline’ syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak ‘wave’ through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring.

Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat’s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world’s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don’t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef’s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens’ labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don’t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don’t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water’s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\xa0\xa0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n']","In 2024, if the average hard coral cover percentage in the Northern GBR is increased by the percentage of the ocean covered by coral reefs globally in 2023, and then decreased by the percentage of sea life supported by coral reefs, what is the new average hard coral cover percentage?","def solve():

Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n', ""Accept cookies?\nWe use cookiesÂ\xa0to give you the best online experience and to show personalised content and marketing.

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCNâ\x80\x99s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\nâ\x80\x9cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,â\x80\x9d she says. â\x80\x9cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods â\x80\x93 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.â\x80\x9d\nâ\x80\x9cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.â\x80\x9d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. Â© Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, itâ\x80\x99s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so itâ\x80\x99s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. Itâ\x80\x99s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. Â©Â\xa0Alberto RodrÃ\xadguez-RamÃ\xadrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.Â\xa0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\nâ\x80\x9cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,â\x80\x9d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. â\x80\x9cTheyâ\x80\x99re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.â\x80\x9d\nâ\x80\x9cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasnâ\x80\x99t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.â\x80\x9d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the regionâ\x80\x99s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbeanâ\x80\x99s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldnâ\x80\x99t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\nâ\x80\x9cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,â\x80\x9d says Beth. â\x80\x9cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.â\x80\x9d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earthâ\x80\x99s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

"['Hydrology and Big River Update\nAfter a wet and joyous 2023 water year, water managers and planners are feeling a little less optimistic about 2024. The good times from the previous period of plenty are now replaced with a feeling of foreboding, like the morning after a great party, as we face a below average forecast for 2024.\nLocally, there is good news to lessen the potential whiplash. Water supply conditions remain good with average to above average soil moisture conditions and healthy carryover storage projected for most of the reservoirs in the District. Also potentially hedging against a dry 2024, is the return of a strong El Niño, with near record warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This is generally correlated with increased precipitation in the southwestern U.S, especially in the spring. According to NOAA Climate Prediction Center, “El Niño remains the major climate driver and is expected to be the primary influence on the mid-latitude circulation” for the near term. Figure 1 reflects this with a slightly wetter near-term (Jan-March 2024) outlook.\nUnfortunately, the benefits of El Niño circulation patterns may be adversely influenced by the significant warming that is affecting the region and across the globe. Climate scientists have now confirmed that 2023 was officially the warmest year ever for the planet.\n\nAcross the Upper Basin and for inflows to Lakes Powell and Mead, the early water supply forecasts are not good and represent a significant departure from the heady days of 2023; the days of increasing or even stable reservoir levels may not persist into the near-term picture, without some changes.\nSince the last staff hydrology memo presented in October 2023, the once near-average seasonal inflow forecast volume for April to July of 2024 has decreased precipitously, losing more than 3 million acre-feet (“maf”), according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, due to excessively dry conditions. The current unregulated inflow forecast for Lake Powell is 4.80 maf or 75% of average and the unregulated inflow forecast for the entire water year for Lake Powell is 7.62 maf or 79% of average. Combined with a projected 7.48 MAF release from Glen Canyon dam, pursuant to the 2007 Interim guidelines, and consideration evaporation losses, annual inflow could be almost the same as annual outflow putting Lake Powell projected elevations to be unchanged at approximately the same elevation of 3668.5 feet AMSL at this same time next year, under this most probable (50% exceedance) inflow projection.\nFor Lake Mead, the most probable projection indicates that Level 1 shortages will likely persist in the Lower Basin in 2024, with Hoover Dam releases limited to about 8.4 million acre-feet to meet reduced downstream demands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t\t\t\nPhone: 970.945.8522 \nFax: 970.945.8799\nEmail: edinfo@crwcd.org\nColorado River Water Conservation District\n201 Centennial St., Suite 200\nGlenwood Springs, CO 81601\nInteractive Map\nFor accessibility inquiries or assistance, please contact:\nEmail: accessibility@crwcd.org\n', 'Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interiorâ\x80\x99s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basinâ\x80\x99s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretaryâ\x80\x99s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015.

Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin\'s network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river\'s flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam\'s headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin\'s water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin\'s abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basinâ\x80\x99s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as â\x80\x9cconsumptive useâ\x80\x9d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam\'s 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with â\x80\x9cwide-headâ\x80\x9d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Meadâ\x80\x99s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the ""24-Month Study"" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead\'s operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead\'s historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead\'s elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead\'s elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years\' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation\'s website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation\'s Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

"['Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interiorâ\x80\x99s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basinâ\x80\x99s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretaryâ\x80\x99s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015.

These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river\'s flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam\'s headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin\'s water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin\'s abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basinâ\x80\x99s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as â\x80\x9cconsumptive useâ\x80\x9d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam\'s 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with â\x80\x9cwide-headâ\x80\x9d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Meadâ\x80\x99s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the ""24-Month Study"" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead\'s operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead\'s historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead\'s elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead\'s elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years\' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation\'s website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation\'s Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead\'s operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information. \nA Quantified Surplus Condition or Domestic Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead\'s January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,145 feet and approximately 1,200 feet. In a surplus condition, entitlement holders  in the Lower Basin may take delivery of additional water, as allowed within their entitlements.  As agreed to under Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, Mexico may also take delivery of additional water within this elevation range. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information.  \nPlease visit the International Boundary and Water Commission website to learn more about the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty and Minute 319 (in effect through 2017).\nRead More >>\nA Normal Condition or Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead\'s January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,075 and 1,145 feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2°F\n(0.7°C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986–2016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901–1960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8°F (1.0°C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895–2016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2°–1.8°F (0.7°–1.0°C).\nThis increase is about 0.1°F (0.06°C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991–2012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986–2016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5°F (0.8°C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0°F [0.6°C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5°F [0.3°C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5°F (0.8°C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (°F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986–2016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901–1960 for the contiguous United States, 1925–1960 for Alaska and Hawai‘i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA’s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979–2016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512°F (0.284°C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455°F (0.253°C),\n0.421°F (0.234°C), and 0.289°F (0.160 °C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971–2000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986–2005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30°–55°N, 75°–130°W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000–2006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai‘i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5°F\n[2.5°C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0°F [0.6°C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961–1990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961–1990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (°F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986–2016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901–1960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2°F [1.2°C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5°F [0.8°C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961–1990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901–2015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble—a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no “detectable” warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this “warming hole,” or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (°F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901–2015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n© American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March–May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021–2050 relative to 1976–2005 are projected to be about 2.5°F\n(1.4°C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9°F (1.6°C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5°F (1.4°C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be “common”\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071–2100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0°F (2.8°C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7°F (4.8°C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8°–7.3°F (1.6°–4.1°C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8°–11.9°F (3.2°–6.6°C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (°F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036–2065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976–2005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0°F [6.7°C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0°F [5.5°C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai‘i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0°–6.0°F [2.2°–3.3°C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036–2065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036–2065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071–2100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071–2100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(°F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036–2065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976–2005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\xad\xad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5°F\n(2.8°C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10°F (5.5°C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2°F (1.1°C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in “very\nrare” extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0°F (6.1°C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90°F and a minimum temperature below 32°F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036–2065) and the average for near-present\n(1976–2005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20–30 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90°F (32°C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40–50 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20–30 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40–50 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10–20\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us •\nCredits •\nPrivacy Policy •\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material.']","Considering the severe drop in Lake Mead's elevation and its impact on Hoover Dam's power capacity, calculate the total reduction in power capacity in megawatts due to the decline in Lake Mead's elevation from 2001 to 2015, given that for every 1-foot drop in elevation, the power capacity of Hoover Dam is reduced by 5.7 megawatts.

Numerous other climatic effects are also expected. For example, U.S. precipitation, which increased by 5 to 10% over the 20th century, is predicted to continue to increase overall. More specifically, an ensemble of GCMs predicts a 20% increase for northern North America, a 15% increase in winter precipitation for northwestern regions, and a general increase in winter precipitation for central and eastern regions. Despite predictions of increased precipitation in most regions, net decreases in water availability are expected in those areas, due to offsetting increases in evaporation. A 20% decrease in summer precipitation, for example, is projected for southwestern regions, and a general decrease in summer precipitation is projected for southern areas. Although projected regional impacts of climate change are highly variable between models, the above impacts are consistent across models. \nGlobal Climate Change And Water Resources\nAdditional effects of global climate change that have important implications for water resources include increased evaporation rates, a higher proportion of precipitation received as rain, rather than snow, earlier and shorter runoff seasons, increased water temperatures, and decreased water quality in both inland and coastal areas. The physical and economic consequences of each of these effects are discussed below. \nIncreased evaporation rates are expected to reduce water supplies in many regions. The greatest deficits are expected to occur in the summer, leading to decreased soil moisture levels and more frequent and severe agricultural drought. More frequent and severe droughts arising from climate change will have serious management implications for water resource users. Agricultural producers and urban areas are particularly vulnerable, as evidenced by recent prolonged droughts in the western and southern United States, which are estimated to have caused over $6  billion in damages to the agricultural and municipal sectors. Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.\nWater users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses. Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses. A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation. Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate. \nRising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow. Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows. Such shifts in the form and timing of precipitation and runoff, specifically in snow-fed basins, are likely to cause more frequent summer droughts. Research shows that these changes are already taking place in the western United States. Changes in snow pack and runoff are of concern to water managers in a number of settings, including hydropower generation, irrigated agriculture, urban water supply, flood protection and commercial and recreational fishing. Timing of runoff will affect the value of hydropower potential in some basins if peak water run-off occurs during nonpeak electricity demand. Energy shortages and resulting energy price increases will provide incentives to expand reservoir capacities or develop alternative energy sources. \nIf the runoff season occurs primarily in winter and early spring, rather than late spring and summer, water availability for summer-irrigated crops will decline, and water shortages  will occur earlier in the growing season, particularly in watersheds that lack large reservoirs. Agricultural producers, in response to reduced water supplies and crop yields, will adjust their crop mix. Producers in irrigated regions might reduce total planted acreage, or deficit-irrigate more acres, to concentrate limited water supplies on their most valuable crops (e.g. onions and potatoes, rather than wheat and alfalfa). Producers in rain-fed regions might shift to crop species and varieties with shorter growing season requirements or greater drought tolerance, such as winter grains. \nCropping practices are likely to shift as well, perhaps towards reduced- or no-till technologies, which enhance water infiltration and conserve soil moisture, or towards irrigation technologies that are more efficient at the farm level (although not necessarily at the basin level). Producers may begin to supplement dwindling surface water supplies with groundwater resources, a response that has already been observed in many drought-stricken areas. These adjustments will mitigate a portion of private economic losses. They will also affect environmental quality, although the expected direction is more difficult to predict. \nA shift in stream hydrographs to more winter flow may also disrupt the life cycle of cold water fish species, such as salmon, which depend on late spring flows to \x93flush\x94 young salmon to the ocean, and on summer flows to moderate water temperatures. Unless winter runoff is captured and stored for late spring or summer use, fewer salmon smolt will survive migration and more frequent fish kills will occur from lethal stream water temperatures. Such environmental impacts will intensify debates about consumptive versus instream water uses, such as those ongoing in the Klamath and Platte River Basins. \nClimate change is expected to affect water quality in both inland and coastal areas. Specifically, precipitation is expected to occur more frequently via high-intensity rainfall events, causing increased runoff and erosion. More sediments and chemical runoff will therefore be transported into streams and groundwater systems, impairing water quality. Water quality may be further impaired if decreases in water supply cause nutrients and contaminants to become more concentrated.  Rising air and water temperatures will also impact water quality by increasing primary production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling rates in lakes and streams, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels.  Lakes and wetlands associated with return flows from irrigated agriculture are of particular concern. This suite of water quality effects will increase the number of water bodies in violation of today\x92s water quality standards, worsen the quality of water bodies that are currently in violation, and ultimately increase the cost of meeting current water quality goals for both consumptive and environmental purposes.  \nRising sea levels could also reduce water quality and availability in coastal areas. Recent projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century range from 19 to 58 cm. A more dramatic increase in sea-level, on the order of meters rather than centimeters, is possible, but most scientists consider it a low probability risk. For example, complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or West Antarctic Ice Sheet would trigger such a large rise. Rising sea levels could affect groundwater quality directly via saltwater intrusion. Radical changes to the freshwater hydrology of coastal areas, caused by saltwater intrusion, would threaten many coastal regions\x92 freshwater supplies. \nRising sea levels could also affect water availability in coastal areas indirectly by causing water tables in groundwater aquifers to rise, which could increase surface runoff at the expense of aquifer recharge. Water shortages will cause the price of water to rise, through monthly water bills or one-time connection fees for new homes and businesses. A sufficiently large price increase could affect the extent and pattern of urban growth throughout the United States. Costly water supply projects, such as desalination plants, pipelines, and dams will also become more economically attractive. \nOne final and important effect of the water resource impacts discussed above is the potential for more frequent and intense interstate and international water allocation conflicts. Water markets have the potential to prevent or diffuse such conflicts; however, the assignment of water rights to establish the market can create more conflict than it diffuses.\nCoping With Changing Water Resources\nAlthough subject to uncertainty, forecasts of climatic change offer a glimpse into possible future water resource impacts and challenges. Predicted impacts vary by region, but include increased temperatures and evaporation rates; higher proportions of winter precipitation arriving as rain, not snow; earlier and more severe summer drought, and decreased water quality. Water shortages, which currently result in substantial economics losses, will be more common in many regions because of these impacts. Such economic losses, which occur across a range of sectors, from agriculture to energy and recreation, have profound effects on local communities. More frequent shortages imply increased costs to society, although adaptation by water users will mitigate some portion of these costs. \nWater resource users can reduce the negative effects of water shortages through a number of strategies. These include revising water storage and release programs for reservoirs, adopting crops and cropping practices that are robust over a wider spectrum of water availability, expanding and adjusting crop insurance programs (such as the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program\x92s Prevented Planting Provision), adjusting water prices to encourage conservation and the expansion of water supply infrastructure, and supporting water transfer opportunities. Damage from drought-induced wildfires can be minimized by using long range soil moisture forecasts to pre-position fire suppression resources and in the longer term, by changing land-use regulations to restrict development in areas facing increased fire risk.\nThe ability to anticipate and efficiently prepare for future water resource management challenges is currently limited, in part, by imprecise regional climate change models and long-term weather forecasts. Uncertainty about future climate conditions makes it more difficult to optimally prepare for and adapt to associated changes in water resource availability and quality. Imagine, for example, trying to prepare optimally for a water shortage when you are uncertain of when it will occur, how severe it will be, or how long it will persist. It may be tempting to make management plans based on the worst-case scenario; however, the opportunity cost of this \x93safety-first\x94 approach can be high if the worst-case does not occur. Imperfect information ultimately increases the magnitude of economic losses (or reduce the magnitude of any potential economic gains) attributable to water resource changes. \nImprovements in climate projections and long-term weather forecasts, such as forecasts based on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), offer potential for reducing economic losses (or increasing economic gains) associated with climate change. More specifically, improvements in the ability to detect water shortages farther in advance, to more precisely forecast their location, intensity, and duration, and to use such forecasts to inform management strategies would enhance water users\x92 confidence in regional forecasts, and their ability to efficiently prepare for and adapt to future water resource management challenges.\nFor More Information\nAdams, R.M  and D.

No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.\'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n""Whilst we can\'t make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,"" Hunter said.\n""Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n""Whilst we can\'t make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.""\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would ""expect to see many more infections in adults"" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China\'s outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn\'t clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China\'s Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children\'s Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children\'s Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children\'s Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital\'s 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO\'s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: ""We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.""\nShe continued, ""Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.""\nWhat\'s the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island\'s ports and airports were all put on ""high alert."" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan\'s public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO\'s Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n""This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,"" Kerkhove said.\n""This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n""We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they\'re seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.""\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n""The spikes are ""not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,"" according to WHO, she said.\n""Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.""\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump\'s New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump\'s War on the D.C.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\xa0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals—expanding some and shrinking others.\xa0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100°F (55°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the ""average"" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth\'s energy budget—how much sunlight\xa0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\xa0temperature readings\xa0to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\xa0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\xa0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth\'s surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Niña climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The ""coolest"" month was November, which was 1.35 ˚F (0.75 ˚C) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)–the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86°C (1.55°F) above the 20th century average of 13.9°C (57.0°F). This value is 0.13°C (0.23°F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02°C (0.04°F) higher than the last year\'s (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014–2022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA\'s National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA\'s\xa02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\xa0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\xa00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\xa0Celsius)\xa0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 °F (0.18 °C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities—burning fossil fuels and clearing forests—add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (""representative concentration pathways,"" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns.

"[""Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation – to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports – and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida – including rural communities and historically underserved populations – the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. ● Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program — meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. ● Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. ● Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: ○ $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA’s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 ● Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America’s roads. ● Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT’s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden’s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. ● Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. ● Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. ● Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports– ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. ● Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. ● Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity — and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. ● Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

Florida Project Spotlights INFRA Award Spotlight I-4 Truck Parking Facilities The Florida Department of Transportation has received $180 million to add approximately 917 truck parking spaces across four sites along I-4 in District Five in Central Florida, which includes locations in Volusia County, Seminole County and Osceola Counties. This project addresses the shortage of overnight parking for commercial vehicles in this region, which also reduces safety issues such as fatigue and unauthorized parking. The project will also incorporate electric charging stations. See here for a full list of INFRA awards. Resilience Project Spotlight Everglades Restoration The Army Corps of Engineers awarded nearly $1.1 billion to the Everglades for ecosystem restoration activities. Years of human development have isolated portions of the Everglades and altered natural flow patterns for freshwater. These projects will help regulate the inflows and outflows of water that are the lifeline of this ecosystem, helping restore the rich biodiversity of the Everglades’ two million acres of wetlands. Thriving wetlands will also filter out pollution to improve water quality for the one-third of Floridians who rely on the Everglades for drinking water, and will help improve resilience to flooding that impacts the state. This historic funding marks the single largest investment in Everglades’ history. See here for the full list of U.S. Army Corps projects announced in 2022. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 Grid Innovation Spotlight Improving Reliability Through Grid Hardening in Florida The Department of Energy is awarding $52.9 million to the Sumter Electric Cooperative to improve reliability of its power grid. This project consists of multiple inter-related components that SECO Energy has developed in response to the need for accelerated resilience efforts. Multiple tropical storms and hurricanes have crossed directly through SECO Energy’s service territory with winds and flooding causing damage and disruptions. SECO Energy’s proposed project will enhance resilience by undergrounding overhead utility lines; hardening existing poles and increasing line capacity; replacing aging, inefficient equipment; and expanding load capacity with a new distribution substation.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June–August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8°F, 2.5°F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7°F, 1.3°F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January–August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9°F, 3.0°F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January–August period on record.\nThe Alaska January–August temperature was 31.2°F, 2.4°F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June–August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January–August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January–August period.The January–August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month’s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\xa0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October–December 2024.\xa0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\xa0\nNOAA’s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n© Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\xa0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n© Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\xa0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

"[""\n\t\t\tCalifornia’s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\xa0WhatMatters\xa0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\xa0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\xa0\n“That really bottlenecks us right in the front door,” said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno’s Community Regional Medical Center and the county’s interim health officer. “We’re very worried.”\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\xa0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n“We are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,” said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. “We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\xa0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\nΔ\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\xa0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\xa0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\xa0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\xa0\n“We’re tired. We’re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,” said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county’s two hospitals. “It’s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It’s going to be exhausting, stretching.”\n“We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\xa0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\xa0\n“That person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,” Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\xa0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. “Number one, she’s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there’s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it’s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.”\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\xa0\n“Our hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,” Vohra said. “When you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that’s 500 to 1000 people that are out.”\xa0\nSome are out because they’re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\xa0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure — at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar’s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\xa0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn’t been cleared to talk to the press, said she’s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\xa0\n“I was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter’s while doing everything else,” she said. “It’s such a juggling act.”\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\xa0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\xa0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county’s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\xa0\n“We are full with patients coming to us through the front door,” Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital’s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. “Nothing about COVID-19 is typical.”\xa0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\xa0\n“ICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,” Castro said. “They are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.”\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\xa0\nIt’s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County — the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, “hospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,” Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\xa0\nSince October, Modoc County — wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet — has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county’s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra’s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\xa0\n“We have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,” Sergienko said.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds — none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\xa0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\xa0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\xa0\nLuu, however, said the ICU “is full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,” according to the health advisory. “The current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.”\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\xa0\nImperial County’s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was “exhausted.”\xa0\n“Exhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,” said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. “And a little scared about what’s going to happen soon.”\xa0\nAlready, she said, she’s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\xa0\n“I called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,” the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. “For those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that’s going to prove to be a big problem.”\xa0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\xa0\n“For those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that’s going to prove to be a big problem.”\xa0\n“It’s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,” said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. “There is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn’t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.”\xa0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\xa0\n“Families have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,” he said. “It’s devastating to the family. It’s devastating to the nurses. It’s devastating to the physicians. It’s just not a normal thing we’re used to doing. And it’s so impersonal, for something that’s so personal.”\xa0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn’t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\xa0\n“Now when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, ‘Is that another coronavirus patient that’s going to be going into the hospital?’” he said. “I’m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we’re just getting going.”\xa0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California’s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\xa0WhatMatters\xa0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\xa0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\xa0\n“That really bottlenecks us right in the front door,” said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno’s Community Regional Medical Center and the county’s interim health officer. “We’re very worried.”\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\xa0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n“We are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,” said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. “We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\xa0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\nΔ\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\xa0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\xa0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\xa0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\xa0\n“We’re tired. We’re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,” said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county’s two hospitals. “It’s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It’s going to be exhausting, stretching.”\n“We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\xa0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\xa0\n“That person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,” Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\xa0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. “Number one, she’s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there’s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it’s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.”\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\xa0\n“Our hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,” Vohra said. “When you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that’s 500 to 1000 people that are out.”\xa0\nSome are out because they’re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\xa0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure — at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar’s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\xa0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn’t been cleared to talk to the press, said she’s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\xa0\n“I was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter’s while doing everything else,” she said. “It’s such a juggling act.”\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\xa0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\xa0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county’s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\xa0\n“We are full with patients coming to us through the front door,” Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital’s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. “Nothing about COVID-19 is typical.”\xa0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\xa0\n“ICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,” Castro said. “They are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.”\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\xa0\nIt’s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County — the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, “hospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,” Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\xa0\nSince October, Modoc County — wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet — has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county’s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average.

"['L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day — breaking the previous record set Sunday — and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n“I do think that we’re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,” L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week — breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n“Like a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,” Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county’s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 — the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state’s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state’s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients — by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but “at a certain point, you run out of options, and that’s what we’re worried about,” Simon said. \n“The worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that’s beyond a tragedy,” he said. “It’s just something that we can’t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.”\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated “than just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,” said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, “they make a downward adjustment — sort of, you get a penalty.”\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: “If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.”\n“The ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,” the department statement continued. “If a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.”\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region’s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That’s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n“We’re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we’re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,” Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that’s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders — which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining — are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n“To be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,” San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. “But our window is narrowing and closing fast.”\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n“Vaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,” he said. “FDA authorization will mean that it’s safe and that it’s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.”\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that “the worst is not yet behind us.”\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n ‘A huge burden’: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Staying home and preventing coronavirus infections will help hospitals manage the influx of patients. As officials wait and hope for the stay-at-home order to tame the surge, they are anxiously tracking ICU capacity.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s what you need to know about ICU capacity and why it’s important at this stage of the pandemic.\nFive things you need to know about COVID-19\nUPDATED\xa0Oct. 2, 2020 | 5:15 PM\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nA lot of them are the same as symptoms of a cold or the flu: cough, sore throat, congestion or a runny nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever or chills, and shortness of breath. A person with COVID-19 may also experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a new loss of taste or smell. In cases of serious illness, it can take time for symptoms to worsen.\nHow long does it take for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the coronavirus?\nThe first symptoms can appear in as few as two days, but it can also take as long as two weeks, according to the CDC. An incubation period of four or five days is more typical. However, a significant proportion of people who are infected — perhaps as much as 45% — never develop any symptoms, researchers say.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm infected?\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you’ve been in close contact with someone who has it, the CDC recommends that you get a coronavirus test. Until you get your test results, you should assume you are infected. That means staying at home as much as possible so that you don’t risk infecting others. Of course, if you’re having a medical emergency, don’t be afraid to call 911.  \nSome diagnostic tests look for genetic evidence of the virus in a sample of saliva or a specimen collected from the nose or throat. Others can detect specific coronavirus molecules that prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting antibodies.\nHow can I reduce my risk of infection?\nLimit contact with people outside of your household. When you do go out, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth and stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible. Clean your hands frequently by using soap and water for 20 seconds or a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. At home, clean and disinfect tables, doorknobs, faucets and other frequently touched surfaces once a day.\nHow did the pandemic start?\nScientists think it began with a close relative of the novel coronavirus that has been circulating in bats and other animals for so long that it no longer makes them sick. That virus must have gained a key mutation that allowed it to infect humans. Health officials in China reported the first cases of the respiratory illness that came to be known as COVID-19 in December 2019. The first known case in Los Angeles was in January. California has had more than 800,000 confirmed cases since.\nWhat is an ICU?\nAn ICU, or intensive care unit, is a specialized hospital department that cares for people in the most critical health situations, such as those with life-threatening injuries or severe illnesses. ICUs are equipped with specialized equipment, such as ventilators.\nMost important, ICUs are staffed with highly trained nurses and physicians who provide round-the-clock care to their patients — checking their breathing, blood pressure, fluids and other vital signs. Dr. Shruti Gohil, an infectious disease specialist at UCI Health, said there is a 1-to-1 ratio of nurses to patients in ICUs.\nAdvertisement\n“That kind of minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour care requires a level of training on the nurses to ... recognize problems quickly and address them quickly and then know what needs to be done while waiting,” Gohil said.\nA COVID-19 patient with severe difficulty breathing may require ventilator support in an ICU.\n“We are responding at the moment to a tsunami of COVID-19 patients in the hospital,” said Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Assn. “But that does not stop the heart attacks, the strokes, the cancer patients with serious, immediate needs.”\nAdvertisement\nWhat is ICU capacity?\nCapacity is the number of staffed beds available at a point in time.\nDetermining whether capacity has been reached is more nebulous.\nThe state determines a region’s ICU capacity with a weighted formula to ensure that some ICU beds remain open for non-COVID patients. When the state says a region has reached 0%, it may actually still have some beds available. Individual counties, such as Fresno, have reported having no open ICU beds.\nCapacity also fluctuates as patients exit the ICU and others enter.\n“There’s always sort of this movement that’s not always quite captured by the snapshots that we get,” said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County. “Overall, the capacity is severely impacted.”\nWhat happens when an ICU reaches 0% capacity?\nHospitals will likely place patients in open beds elsewhere in the hospital, such as emergency department rooms.\nHaving open beds in other parts of the hospital does not mean a hospital is equipped to handle more intensive care patients. Dr. Bill Stringer, chief pulmonologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said the “limiting step is not going to be space or equipment. It’s going to be staff.”\nBecause of their specialized training in high-intensity situations, ICU medical professionals are scarce resources.\n\nCalifornia\nHere’s what the ICU ward looks like with 0% availability\nICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and the crisis is expected to get worse, officials warn.\nDec. 21, 2020\n“The problem is, we’ve got a nationwide shortage of critical care nurses,” Coyle said. “It is not the case where you can pull any nurse into the ICU to provide that level of care.”\nAdvertisement\nAnd when ICUs are stretched beyond capacity, the quality of care can decline and mortality rates can rise.\nAs ICU capacity shrinks, a hospital is likely to scale back elective procedures, freeing up staff. Some healthcare workers — such as those who work in trauma, surgery and anesthesia — are already trained for high-stress scenarios, so they would be “natural pivots” to the ICU, Gohil said. A critical care professional would supervise.\n“In a poor, catastrophic state, it would be an all-hands-on-deck approach,” Gohil said.\nIf a hospital’s beds fill, some patients may be transferred to neighboring hospitals. But moving ICU patients is risky, Stringer said.\n“Just imagine somebody who is just completely inert, that is sedated, that is being supported at least with a ventilator,” Stringer said. “It’s the most fragile and vulnerable patient being transferred. That’s a very difficult decision.”\nHow do I find out the ICU capacity where I live?\nThe state keeps an updated list of ICU bed availability by county.\nHospitals report their capacities daily, and the state tallies them.\nHere are the regional numbers as of Thursday afternoon:\n\nSouthern California: 7.7%, down from 9% Wednesday\nSan Joaquin Valley: 1.9%, down from 4.2%\nGreater Sacramento: 13.3%, down from 14.3%\nBay Area: 17.8%, down from 20.9%\nNorthern California: 30.3%, an improvement from 27.1%\n\nI live in a region where ICU space is at capacity, but I have a medical emergency. What do I do?\nYou should still seek help. If you’re in a serious emergency, call 911.\nAdvertisement\nOtherwise, Stringer said, call the hospital emergency departments near you to check their capacity. Then wear a mask and go.\n“The hospital, even though we have plenty of COVID patients, is still a safe place to get care,” Stringer said. “It’s probably not as safe as being on a backpacking trip in the Rockies. But if you’ve got an emergency, you need to call.”\nMore to Read\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s new coronavirus wave is disrupting lives, even with less severe illness\nJune 1, 2022\n*    \nAnother bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Adequate staffing levels ensure that nurses can provide thorough and attentive care, which is essential for positive patient outcomes. Conversely, inadequate nurse-patient ratios can lead to increased patient morbidity and mortality, nurse burnout, and reduced quality of care. As healthcare systems globally grapple with resource constraints and increasing patient demands, understanding the impact of nurse-patient ratios is paramount for policy-making and healthcare management. This paper reviews existing literature on nurse-patient ratios, examining their influence on healthcare quality and patient safety. The goal is to identify the key outcomes associated with varying staffing levels and propose strategies for optimizing nurse-patient ratios to improve healthcare delivery [1].\nLiterature Review Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between nurse-patient ratios and patient outcomes. Studies have shown that lower nurse-patient ratios are associated with decreased patient morbidity and mortality. That improved nurse staffing levels significantly reduced the incidence of hospital-acquired infections, pressure ulcers, and patient falls. Nurse Job satisfaction and retention are also influenced by nurse-patient ratios. High patient loads can lead to increased stress, burnout, and job dissatisfaction among nurses. This not only affects the well-being of nurses but also impacts patient care, as high turnover rates can disrupt continuity and quality of care. Healthcare quality, as measured by patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes, is closely tied to nurse staffing levels. Hospitals with adequate nurse-patient ratios tend to have higher patient satisfaction scores, as patients receive more personalized and timely care. Additionally, better-staffed units often experience fewer medical errors and higher adherence to clinical guidelines [2].\nDiscussion Optimizing nurse-patient ratios is essential for enhancing healthcare quality and patient safety. Several strategies can be employed to achieve this goal. First, implementing mandated staffing ratios, as seen in California, where legislation requires specific nurse-to-patient ratios in hospitals, can ensure a baseline standard for staffing levels. Research indicates that these regulations have led to improved patient outcomes and nurse satisfaction. Second, employing flexible staffing models that adjust to patient acuity and census can help manage workload more effectively. Utilizing data-driven tools to predict patient needs and adjust staffing accordingly ensures that resources are allocated efficiently. Third, investing in nurse workforce development is crucial. Providing ongoing education, career development opportunities, and supportive work environments can enhance nurse retention and attract new entrants to the profession. This, in turn, can help maintain adequate staffing levels [3].\nFinally, leveraging technology to support nursing practice can alleviate some of the burdens associated with high patient loads. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), telehealth, and other digital tools can streamline documentation, facilitate communication, and enhance care coordination, allowing nurses to focus more on direct patient care. Healthcare quality and safety are fundamental aspects of healthcare delivery that ensure patient well-being and optimal health outcomes. Quality in healthcare refers to the degree to which health services for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes consistent with current professional knowledge. Safety, a crucial component of quality, involves minimizing risks, errors, and harm to patients during the provision of healthcare services. Together, healthcare quality and safety form the bedrock of effective medical practice and patient care. A key element of healthcare quality is the implementation of evidence-based practices. These practices are rooted in the best available scientific evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values. By adhering to evidence-based guidelines, healthcare providers can ensure that the treatments and interventions they offer are both effective and efficient. For instance, the use of standardized protocols for managing chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension has been shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce complications. Similarly, adherence to surgical checklists has been proven to significantly decrease surgical errors and infections [4].\nPatient safety initiatives aim to create a safe healthcare environment by preventing and reducing risks, errors, and harm that can occur during patient care. These initiatives encompass a range of strategies, including the development of safety protocols, the use of technology to prevent errors, and the promotion of a culture of safety within healthcare organizations. For example, the implementation of Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems has been instrumental in reducing medication errors by ensuring accurate and legible prescriptions. Additionally, the use of barcoding systems Adv Practice Nurs, Volume 09:03, 2024 Page 2 of 2 Dela C.\nfor medication administration ensures that patients receive the correct medications at the appropriate dosages. A critical aspect of healthcare quality and safety is the continuous monitoring and improvement of healthcare processes [5].\nAnother vital component of healthcare quality is patient-centered care. This approach involves respecting patients\' preferences, needs, and values and ensuring that they guide all clinical decisions. Patient-centered care emphasizes the importance of effective communication, shared decision-making, and providing compassionate and respectful care. By involving patients in their care, healthcare providers can improve patient satisfaction, adherence to treatment plans, and overall health outcomes. Healthcare quality and safety are also influenced by the work environment and culture within healthcare organizations. A supportive work environment that promotes teamwork, open communication, and continuous learning is essential for ensuring high-quality and safe patient care. Organizations that prioritize staff well-being, provide ongoing education and training, and encourage reporting and learning from errors is better positioned to deliver safe and effective care. Moreover, regulatory bodies and accreditation organizations play a significant role in promoting healthcare quality and safety. These entities establish standards and guidelines that healthcare organizations must adhere to and conduct regular inspections and evaluations to ensure compliance. Accreditation by organizations such as The Joint Commission signifies that a healthcare facility meets high standards of care and safety [6]. Conclusion The nurse-patient ratio is a critical factor influencing healthcare quality and patient safety. Adequate staffing levels are associated with better patient outcomes, higher nurse job satisfaction, and overall improved healthcare delivery. By implementing mandated staffing ratios, employing flexible staffing models, investing in workforce development, and leveraging technology, healthcare organizations can optimize nurse-patient ratios to enhance patient care and nurse well-being. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, prioritizing adequate nurse staffing will remain essential for ensuring high-quality, safe, and effective patient care.\nAcknowledgement None.\nConflict of Interest None.\nHow to cite this article: Dela, Christmal. “The Impact of Nurse-patient Ratios on Healthcare Quality and Safety.” Adv Practice Nurs 9 (2024): 387.\nReferences 1.

But we fought back—and won,"" Biden said in a statement.\n""Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.""\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n""It\'s a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn\'s disease, and more—and it\'s a relief for American taxpayers,"" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n""This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,"" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden\'s price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren\'t set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n""As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,"" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. ""This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.""\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n""Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,"" Norris said. ""But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.""\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n""It\'s a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn\'t be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn\'t have the same amount of coverage many need,"" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n""Even if you don\'t use one of the drugs covered, it\'s an encouraging sign,"" he added. ""With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.""\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the \'Avenger Squad\' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

Collectively, that leading cohort of international buyers paid for 43.9% of globally imported drugs and medicines during 2023. That percentage indicates a relatively concentrated market of buyers worldwide.From a continental perspective, European countries were responsible for over half (53.8%) of spending on drugs and medicines imported during 2023 with pharmaceutical purchases valued at $268 billion. In second place were North American importers at 20.7% while another 17.4% of imported pharmaceuticals was delivered to customers in Asia.Smaller percentages were delivered to Latin America (3.9%) excluding Mexico but including the Caribbean, Africa (2.7%), then Oceania (1.5%) led by Australia and New Zealand.The metrics below combine subtotals for two 4-digit Harmonized Tariff System code prefixes for drugs and medicine subcategories, specifically prefixes 3003 (consisting of 2 or more constituents mixed together) and 3004 (other).Drugs and Medicines: Top 15 Importer CountriesBelow are the 15 countries that imported the highest dollar value worth of drugs and medicines during 2023.United States: US$89.8 billion (18% of imported prescription drugs and medicines)Switzerland: $40.5 billion (8.1%)Germany: $32.5 billion (6.5%)Belgium: $31.3 billion (6.3%)mainland China: $24.5 billion (4.9%)Italy: $20.6 billion (4.1%)France: $18.4 billion (3.7%)United Kingdom: $16.8 billion (3.4%)Japan: $15.9 billion (3.2%)Netherlands: $15.8 billion (3.2%)Spain: $14.9 billion (3%)Canada: $11.5 billion (2.3%)Russia: $8.7 billion (1.7%)Slovenia: $7.5 billion (1.5%)Poland: $6.9 billion (1.4%)By value, the listed 15 countries purchased 71.4% of all prescription drugs and medicines imports in 2023.Among the above countries, the fastest-growing markets for prescription drugs and medicines since 2019 were: Slovenia (up 92.6%), Switzerland (up 90.4%), Netherlands (up 55.9%) and Spain (up 38.5%).Three major markets that posted declines in their imported prescription drugs and medicines purchases were: Russia (down -16.9% from 2022), United Kingdom (down -10.6%) and Japan (down -6.4%).Drugs and Medicines: All Importer Countries in 2023By value, the 100 key countries showcased in the following automated database bought 98.5% of imported pharmaceutical drugs and medicines purchased in 2023.RankImporterDrugs & Medicines%2019-231.United States$89,784,868,000+13.3%2.Switzerland$40,508,742,000+90.4%3.Germany$32,470,160,000+4.7%4.Belgium$31,341,161,000+33%5.mainland China$24,543,916,000+14.1%6.Italy$20,578,736,000+20.4%7.France$18,352,469,000+15.5%8.United Kingdom$16,789,558,000-10.6%9.Japan$15,874,455,000-6.4%10.Netherlands$15,846,137,000+55.9%11.Spain$14,915,496,000+38.5%12.Canada$11,528,660,000+35.5%13.Russia$8,677,211,000-16.9%14.Slovenia$7,547,471,000+92.6%15.Poland$6,943,402,000+33.5%16.Australia$6,060,842,000+13.3%17.Ireland$5,971,430,000+39.2%18.Czech Republic$5,412,484,000+26.1%19.South Korea$5,334,372,000+30.1%20.Brazil$5,073,335,000+31.7%21.Austria$4,648,764,000+22.6%22.Mexico$4,533,840,000+60.3%23.Romania$4,300,172,000+40.3%24.Taiwan$4,166,141,000+35%25.Denmark$3,872,409,000+17.6%26.Saudi Arabia$3,666,414,000-11.9%27.Sweden$3,346,424,000+17.1%28.Egypt$3,275,554,000+51.4%29.Hungary$3,074,217,000+6.7%30.Greece$2,987,559,000+35.3%31.Hong Kong$2,983,988,000+34.1%32.Portugal$2,755,852,000+20.3%33.United Arab Emirates$2,429,182,000-25.6%34.Türkiye$2,344,378,000-13.2%35.Colombia$2,301,768,000+46.5%36.Panama$2,119,079,000+26%37.Thailand$2,088,829,000+20.6%38.Slovakia$2,068,323,000+29.7%39.Singapore$1,923,068,000+20%40.Israel$1,897,285,000+9.4%41.Finland$1,870,201,000+17.1%42.Vietnam$1,819,464,000-32.6%43.Bulgaria$1,763,585,000+37.7%44.Ukraine$1,733,174,000+1%45.South Africa$1,731,505,000-3%46.Norway$1,705,741,000+10.1%47.Philippines$1,705,359,000+23.8%48.Kazakhstan$1,447,313,000+63.6%49.Chile$1,444,123,000+33.2%50.Lithuania$1,375,341,000+32.5%51.India$1,360,321,000-0.6%52.Argentina$1,266,289,000+10.1%53.Serbia$1,258,935,000+56.6%54.Malaysia$1,236,736,000-10.2%55.Croatia$1,157,943,000+30.7%56.New Zealand$1,021,456,000+58.8%57.Ecuador$1,009,529,000+40.5%58.Dominican Republic$903,093,000+50.5%59.Algeria$890,666,000-26.8%60.Indonesia$824,449,000+32.5%61.Guatemala$823,646,000+50.9%62.Latvia$793,096,000+30%63.Iraq$781,840,000-22.3%64.Uzbekistan$725,626,000-12.1%65.Costa Rica$676,671,000+16%66.Peru$670,747,000+15.8%67.Estonia$653,465,000+34.8%68.Luxembourg$627,835,000+39.8%69.Nigeria$616,888,000-31%70.Morocco$590,242,000+28.4%71.Jordan$549,354,000+23.2%72.Kuwait$524,991,000-49.5%73.Honduras$524,968,000+20.4%74.Sri Lanka$518,445,000+32.9%75.El Salvador$503,492,000+28.6%76.Tunisia$480,237,000+9.7%77.Iran$472,615,000-46.3%78.Azerbaijan$461,973,000+76.6%79.Ethiopia$460,848,000-17.4%80.Kenya$452,729,000-4.2%81.Belarus$448,584,000-24.7%82.Cyprus$431,955,000+61%83.Georgia$427,490,000+32.2%84.Nicaragua$419,879,000+30%85.Ivory Coast$403,719,000+16.7%86.Macao$378,970,000+63.3%87.Malta$371,918,000+50.8%88.Pakistan$365,901,000-22.4%89.Bosnia/Herzegovina$363,769,000+26.8%90.Myanmar$353,747,000-21.1%91.Qatar$352,935,000-23.8%92.Tanzania$328,493,000+31.2%93.Cambodia$268,915,000+39.6%94.Democratic Rep.

But we fought back—and won,"" Biden said in a statement.\n""Today, for the first time in history, my Administration is announcing that Medicare has reached agreements on new, lower prices with the manufacturers of all 10 drugs selected for the first round of drug price negotiation.""\nThe affected medications include those Americans use to manage diabetes, cancer and heart disease, which affect millions each year.\nFor the 10 medications, Medicare recipients will save between 38 and 79 percent starting in 2026. The drugs include Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara, and Fiasp.\nBlood clot medications Eliquis and Xarelto went down to $231 and $197, while diabetes medications got major savings too.\nJardiance, Januvia, Farxiga and Fiasp shaved hundreds off their list prices for 2026, now costing between $100 and $200 compared to previous costs above $500 for a 30-day supply.\nThe full list of price changes was announced on the White House website.\nAltogether, more than 67 million Americans rely on Medicare for their health coverage, but high drug prices and premiums have made health care unaffordable for many.\n""It\'s a relief for the millions of seniors that take these drugs to treat everything from heart failure, blood clots, diabetes, arthritis, Crohn\'s disease, and more—and it\'s a relief for American taxpayers,"" Biden said.\nMedicare previously said blood thinners Xarelto and Eliquis would see lower prices because of the new deals, alongside diabetes medications Jardiance and Januvia.\nPreviously, the U.S. government was not permitted to negotiate with Big Pharma over drug prices, though private insurers always had this ability.\n""This meant that drug companies could basically charge whatever they want for lifesaving treatments people rely on, and all Americans paid the price,"" White House adviser Neera Tanden said in a media call on Wednesday evening.\nPharmaceutical companies have not been pleased with Biden\'s price negotiations and pushed against the Inflation Reduction Act, which made the negotiations law.\nWhile the first 10 selected drug prices aren\'t set to change until 2026, the U.S. government can pick another 15 medications to negotiate on next year.\nThe Congressional Budget Office estimated that the negotiations would save the government $25 billion in the next seven years.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also instituted a cap on out-of-pocket drug costs, which is set to start in 2025. Next year, seniors can expect to pay a maximum of $2,000 for their prescriptions.\n""As a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare Part D has become a stronger safety net for Medicare beneficiaries who need expensive medications,"" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst for medicareresources.org, told Newsweek. ""This will provide significant financial relief to enrollees who used to spend far more than that for their medications.""\nWith the lower costs on prescriptions, there is some concern that those costs could be passed on to Medicare premium prices. Likely in an effort to mitigate some of those issues, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is paying an extra $15 per member per month to insurers.\n""Some Republican lawmakers are challenging the premium stabilization program, alleging that it should have required congressional approval,"" Norris said. ""But the implementation of this program should ensure that people with Medicare Part D continue to have multiple affordable options for 2025.""\nOpen enrollment for Medicare begins October 15 and runs to December 7, with all plan selections taking effect in January.\n""It\'s a big win for Medicare recipients. One of the concerns going into these negotiations was that a deal wouldn\'t be reached, and a few of these drugs wouldn\'t have the same amount of coverage many need,"" Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek.\n""Even if you don\'t use one of the drugs covered, it\'s an encouraging sign,"" he added. ""With an increasing older population in America, more taxpayers are going to join Medicare in the coming years. The government taking a more proactive approach to negotiations to cover drug prices is one current and future recipients will be thankful for.""\nUpdate 8/15/24, 10:18 a.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nTop stories\n\nTrump Is Picking the \'Avenger Squad\' for Cabinet, Charlie Kirk Says\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nTrump Allies React to Biden Allowing Ukraine to Hit Russia With US ATACMS\n\nTrump Picks FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr To Lead the Agency\nAbout the writer\nSuzanne Blake is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

"[""Telemedicine Statistics – The Latest Telehealth Statistics in 2024\nIn this guide, we cover the main regional telemedicine markets, the most important telehealth use cases, and the key current and future trends in the field.\nTelemedicine statistics give us information about providing support and healthcare through electronic communication channels, like telephones and the internet. It’s part of the digital transformation of healthcare and has been on the rise for the last few decades.\nIt was COVID-19, however, that really pushed telemedicine and remote clinical services into the spotlight. Around the world, medical professionals and patients relied on telehealth and virtual care to mitigate the risks of infection and optimize the resources of healthcare systems.\nAfter the pandemic, many facilities continued to offer remote healthcare services, and the market has been growing ever since.\nGiven these advancements and the considerable potential impact of telemedicine on healthcare, it’s important to pay attention to telemedicine statistics and trends. Let’s dive in.\nKey Telemedicine Statistics\nTelemedicine Market Size & Forecast\nAccording to Grand View Research, the telemedicine market was valued at almost $115 billion in 2023. The report forecasts it to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.96% between 2023 and 2030. Fortune Business Insights concurs with that assessment, predicting that the telemedicine market will reach $286.22 billion by 2030.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the growth of the telemedicine market and the popularity of digital health solutions. Social distancing measures and the overwhelming impact on medical personnel meant that many routine appointments were canceled. Here’s a quick overview of COVID-19’s impact on telemedicine.\nTelemedicine and Covid-19\nA 2022 study by Kaiser Permanente tells us that before the start of the pandemic, telemedicine integration in the US was rudimentary, although 76% of American hospital systems did have some form of telehealth. However, in the first three months of the pandemic, telehealth insurance claims grew by 766%, and over 20% of all US medical appointments in 2020 were remote.\nMoreover, before COVID-19, 65% of American medical professionals had never used telemedicine, and 23% used it rarely.\nDuring the pandemic’s peak, more than 97% of healthcare experts were using telemedicine. For 43%, half of their appointments were telehealth appointments. In terms of outlook, 44% of US doctors predict that between 10% and 49% of their future appointments will be through telehealth.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Region\nAs with most emerging technologies, regions use and develop telemedicine at different rates. In this section, we look at key telemedicine statistics in different parts of the world, including popularity and uptake, number of users, and consumer attitudes.\nNorth America\nNorth America is the largest telemedicine market in the world, with a share of 33.5%. That’s hardly surprising since many telehealth companies have a presence in the region. Moreover, as of 2022, 22% of global telemedicine companies were looking to expand to Canada and 17% to the US.\nIn 2023, Canada’s telehealth market revenue (including digital treatment and digital wellbeing) reached $2.42 billion,\xa0roughly ~$100 million more than the year before. That revenue is forecast to hit $3.58 billion by 2028, as the significant growth is largely due to Canada’s high telehealth literacy.\nAs of 2021, over 80% of physicians in the country had the expertise to provide virtual care, and 78% were satisfied by the level of patient support they could provide through this channel.\nIn the US, the telemedicine market was valued at $38.04 billion in 2022\xa0and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 15.1% until 2030. In 2023, 44% of physicians used it at least weekly\xa0and 40% daily. For 65% of American physicians, 25% of all their appointments in 2022 were telehealth appointments.\nEurope\nThe European telemedicine market is almost on par with North America in terms of development and growth. As of 2022, 77% of European countries frequently used telemedicine, with COVID-19 contributing to its use. As our infographic shows, the Spanish telemedicine market had a significant boost during COVID-19.\nSpain is the largest telemedicine market in the EU. Almost 72% of Spanish residents had a telemedicine appointment during the pandemic. The market revenue was $270.2 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $351.5 million by 2027.\nGiven that the number of telemedicine users in the country increased from 1.18 million in 2020 to 1.32 million in 2021 and is forecast to reach 1.41 million in 2027, such exponential growth isn’t surprising. The average revenue per user (ARPU) in telemedicine is also forecast to grow from $209.5 in 2022 to $250 by 2027.\nThe UK isn’t far behind. For instance, over 80% of patients in the UK\xa0 had a telephone (22%) or a video consultation (59%) with their doctor during COVID-19. And in 2022, 28% of physicians saw at least 75% of their patients via telemedicine. In comparison, this was 2% in Germany and Sweden, and 1% in France.\nIn 2022, the British telehealth market was valued at $1.58 billion and is forecast to reach $16.2 billion by 2030. The main reasons are the ongoing healthcare crisis in the UK and the government’s digitization efforts.\nLatin America\nIn Latin America (LATAM), Brazil has the largest telehealth market, which is not surprising, considering it’s one of the most populated countries in the world. In 2020, there were around 2.46 million users of online medical consultations.\nThe number grew to 3.49 million in 2023 and is forecast to reach 4.25 million by 2028. The ARPU has been growing steadily since 2021 and is predicted to reach $292.81 in 2028.\nOther LATAM countries have somewhat smaller telemedicine markets. Here’s a breakdown of the region’s 2023 telemedicine market revenue and its forecast growth.\nAsia-Pacific\nThe Asia-Pacific (APAC) telemedicine market is experiencing significant growth. Before the pandemic, the region’s telemedicine adoption rate was low: 5% in Australia, 29% in India, and non-existent in Malaysia. However, in 2024, the adoption rate is predicted to grow exponentially: 70% in Malaysia, 76% in China, and 56% in Australia.\nAPAC’s telemedicine market size was approximately $16.8 billion in 2020, and it’s forecast to more than double by 2025 ($37.1 billion). Japan is expected to see some of the largest growth, from $5.1 billion in 2023 to $7.1 billion in 2028.\nTelemedicine Statistics by Audience\nNow, let’s look at two user groups in these global telemedicine markets: the patients and the medical professionals.\nWho Uses Telemedicine?\nAccording to 2021 research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US, 37% of adults used telemedicine, with slightly more females using it (42%) than males (31.7%). Regarding age, patients aged 65 and over used telemedicine the most (43.3%) and\xa0Gen Z (18–25-year-olds) the least (29.4%) in 2021 .\nAn ASPE (a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services) study conducted a year later\xa0shed more light on telemedicine users in 2022. It shows that 22.5% of adults and 18.1% of children in the US used telemedicine that year.\nLike the CDC study, the ASPE report found that Gen Z use telemedicine the least (17.6%)\xa0and baby boomers (those aged 65+) the most (24.6%). In terms of income split, the highest percentage of telemedicine users in 2022 had an annual income of less than $25,000 (26.4%).\nBut what about other countries?\nIn Spain\xa0more women used telemedicine (63.2%) than men (47.4%) in 2022, like the US. Again, similar to the US, Gen Z had the lowest rate of telemedicine use (49.1%). However, it was the millennials (aged 26–40) who used telemedicine most frequently (58%). For\xa0baby boomers, the rate was 54.1%.\nAttitudes Towards Telemedicine\nAs with all innovations, people have varying opinions about telemedicine. In this section, we look at the statistics related to the opinions and attitudes of medical professionals and patients towards telemedicine.\nAs the above graph shows,\xa0Australia had the highest percentage of physicians worldwide who were satisfied with telehealth in 2022. The potential for time saved using telemedicine was also highest in Australia in 2023 – up to six hours each year.\nIn fact, many physicians worldwide consider telemedicine a convenient solution. Almost 70% of American healthcare professionals perceived telemedicine as ‘convenient’ in 2021, and 35% as ‘efficient.’ Moreover, the lion’s share of these physicians believe that ease of use is the key to ensuring patients’ access to telemedicine.\nConvenience is also the prevalent factor among physicians in other countries. For instance, in Canada, 70% of healthcare professionals found providing video appointments very convenient, and 77% had the same opinion about telephone appointments. And 84% of physicians confirmed that telehealth made it easier for patients to access their care.\nPatients’ attitudes towards telemedicine is moving in a positive direction. Before COVID-19, 66% of adults in the US had concerns about the quality of telemedicine. However, this changed after the pandemic, and as of 2021, 88% preferred to use telemedicine.\nMoreover, studies tell us that during COVID-19, patients’ experiences with telehealth appointments were just as positive as or more positive than face-to-face healthcare appointments in the US.\nOf these appointments, patients tended to prefer video calls to telephone appointments. One study found that women preferred telehealth appointments for certain reproductive health issues.\nPatients in Mexico seem to concur. According to statistics from 2021, almost 80% of telemedicine users said telehealth appointments were just as good as in-person appointments. About one-third of people (27%) in Great Britain were skeptical of telemedicine before trying it.\nTop Telemedicine Use Case Statistics\nNow, let’s take a closer look at why people use telemedicine. In this section, we’ll delve into the most common use cases for telehealth appointments.\nDiagnostics & Follow-up Appointments\nThe most common reason people in the US used telemedicine in 2023 was follow-up appointments, which made up around 47% of all US telehealth appointments. It seems to be the convenience that people find attractive.\nIndeed, in a paper published in The American Journal of Managed Care, researchers stipulate that 52.5% of follow-up patients found telemedicine appointments more efficient.\nMental Health Support\nAnother common purpose of telehealth appointments is mental health support, used by over one-third of American telemedicine users between 2021 and 2023. These telemental health services improve access to mental healthcare for certain groups of people, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution, as it requires some technological literacy.\nChronic Conditions Support\nTelemedicine has been a game-changer for patients with chronic conditions. During COVID-19, telehealth was used by almost 50% of Europeans living with such conditions. In the US, physicians reported that 72% of their telehealth appointments were related to chronic care in 2021.\nIn addition to improving patients’ quality of life, telemedicine is a significant time-saver for people with chronic illnesses. For instance, Italians with chronic pain could save up to 9.5 hours per year with telemedicine, more than in any other country. Germans and Australians with chronic conditions could save up to 7.4 hours.\nFuture Telemedicine Trends\nWhat is the future of telemedicine? Given that it’s already making a huge difference to millions of people’s lives, it’s no surprise that the only way for telehealth is up.\nBut what are the trends shaping its development?\nIntegration With AI\nThe applications of AI in healthcare are boundless, and telemedicine is no exception. AI-powered apps can analyze huge amounts of patient data to help identify patterns and offer invaluable insights.\nChatbots and virtual assistants can enhance patient engagement by providing real-time responses to queries, helping schedule appointments, and setting reminders to take medication. Also, the diagnostics applications of AI can help save time and optimize physicians’ workload.\nAugmented Reality & Virtual Reality\nTelemedicine doesn’t just support patients, it can transform the day-to-day work of medical professionals. AR and VR can help professionals, especially those being trained, to engage in realistic medical simulations, such as surgeries and procedures.\nThese simulations can provide a valuable learning experience, boosting physicians’ competence.\nRemote Patient Monitoring\nRemote patient monitoring (RPM) is a big deal in telemedicine, especially for patients with chronic illnesses. For example, integrating RPM with wearable technologies allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely and access up-to-date data, enabling them to provide the best patient care. It also allows real-time responses to help prevent complications.\nClosing Thoughts\nLike any other medtech innovation, telehealth’s primary goal is to help people. During COVID-19, we were shown how well telemedicine can work on an unprecedented scale, leading to accelerated digital transformation in medical technologies. As of 2023, that market was worth more than $100 billion, and it continues to grow.\nIn this guide, we reviewed the key telemedicine markets, how they are growing, how patients and medical professionals perceive telemedicine, and the most common use cases.\nWe feel optimistic about the future of telemedicine, telehealth, and other medtech advancements. However, we also know that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution, and we look forward to seeing how innovators will bridge the gap that restricts access to telemedicine and other healthcare to various population groups.\nSources\nQuestion & Answers (0)\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

In fact, it wasn’t really about the SARS-CoV-2 virus at all. It was the dramatic growth of telehealth.\nBetween February and April 2020, telehealth visits for primary care, conducted either by phone or video, increased from zero to 148 visits per 1,000 patients at Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in California, according to new research from the Santa Monica–based RAND Corporation. In contrast, in-person care dropped from about 230 to 65 visits per 1,000 patients during that time, RAND found.\nBy the summer of 2021, the number of in-person visits at California FQHCs had rebounded to 66% of primary care appointments, but telehealth still composed about one-third of visits. Telehealth is even more prevalent in the behavioral health care realm, with 72% of appointments conducted either by phone or video as of August 2021.\n“We joke that a decade of telemedicine implementation happened in a week or two,” said Lori Uscher-Pines, a RAND senior policy researcher. “It was amazing how quickly health systems and individual providers were able to start offering telehealth visits.”\nThis rapid shift to telehealth is unsurprising, given the urgency of keeping patients and staff members safe during the pandemic. What remains to be seen is whether, once the dust settles and COVID-19 is deemed less of a threat, telehealth will be here to stay.\nThe findings of the RAND report suggest that while telehealth has a valuable role in increasing access to care, it should not serve as a blanket replacement for in-person visits. There were concerns over the efficacy of audio-only appointments, the difficulties in implementing video visits, and whether patients might be at risk of receiving inadequate care because of these technological challenges. As a result, a hybrid model, including in-person, video, and occasionally audio visits that caters to patients’ individual needs, would likely be the best approach, the researchers said.\nOvercoming Barriers to Care\nA strong argument in favor of telehealth is that virtual visits, both audio and video, enhance equity by increasing accessibility and flexibility for patients. “We look at the many barriers that patients face in getting care — geography, transportation, childcare, getting time off work, language,” said Chris Perrone, director of CHCF’s Improving Access team, which funded RAND’s research. “Telehealth makes it easier to see or talk with a physician without having to find childcare, take a day off work, or travel long distances.”\nThat expands access to care, Perrone said.\nHowever, there are questions about whether the level of care offered in telehealth visits is as effective and as high quality as in-person visits. Also, some visits must be conducted in person because of the need for a physical examination or the collection of lab samples and biometric information.\nBefore the pandemic, one of the biggest concerns about telehealth services was the rising costs of that approach to providing care. “Telemedicine use was very restricted prior to the pandemic, both at the federal level and at the state level across the US,” Uscher-Pines said. “A big concern was that offering telehealth would increase costs without necessarily improving population health. That’s because telehealth is so easy to access and it’s so convenient that it would lead to extra utilization that was not necessary.”\nBefore the pandemic, Medicare and state Medicaid programs did not pay for telehealth visits except in specified situations. In March 2020, that policy quickly changed out of necessity. In March of this year, federal reimbursements for telehealth services were extended until at least the end of 2022 — and possibly longer — with the Consolidated Appropriations Act. In California, the Department of Health Care Services is committed to continue paying FQHCs for video and audio telehealth visits after the pandemic — covering all Medi-Cal covered benefits and services.\nPerceptions of Telehealth\nFacing this inflection point, CHCF commissioned several reports to assess the state of telehealth during the pandemic at California FQHCs, which serve people with low incomes and are primarily funded through reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.\nAn assessment (PDF)\xa0of 23 FQHCs’ implementation of telehealth during the height of COVID-19, found that 86% of providers were satisfied with the work they performed via telehealth and 84% would continue providing telehealth after the pandemic subsides.\nA second report from RAND surveyed staff and providers at 45 FQHCs, public hospitals, and community health centers across the state, which serve a combined 1.7 million patients. It found that, overall, “Perceptions of whether telehealth provided an acceptable level of care were relatively positive, but perceptions of its sustainability — as well as perceptions of equity and quality of care — were nuanced.”\nWith hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.\n—Lori Uscher-Pines, RAND Corporation\nTelehealth provided important access to care during the pandemic and helped patients overcome “barriers to in-person care, such as transportation,” the report found. However, there were concerns about “inequities in access, particularly for patients who were most affected by the digital divide.”\nCHCF also funded other research that documents patient views on telehealth. A 2020 CHCF survey of people with low incomes found their telehealth visits compared favorably to in-person visits. Seventy-two percent of respondents who received care by phone were as satisfied or more satisfied. Of those who received care by video, 65% were as satisfied or more satisfied than with their last in-person visit.\nAudio-Only Versus Video Visits\nHealth care workers’ biggest worry centered around phone versus video visits. Among the FQHCs that were part of RAND’s recent analysis, less than 5% of telehealth visits were conducted via video, despite their advantages over audio-only visits in many cases. As a result, a major emphasis has been on how clinics can expand access to video visits for their patients.\n“Surveys suggest that providers generally prefer video visits,” said Uscher-Pines. “They get additional information — for example, just being able to see and visually examine the patient. Providers say they really like being able to see a patient’s home environment and for the patient to open up their medicine cabinet and show what’s in it.”\nHowever, it’s also true that many patients don’t like video for this very reason — they don’t want to let providers into their homes, particularly if they haven’t developed a trusting relationship with the provider.\nNeighborhood Healthcare in San Diego County and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG) were two FQHCs that invested in video telehealth early in the pandemic. They reported that there were considerable growing pains in getting both patients and physicians to use the technology.\nIt’s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don’t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is.\n—Amanda Churape, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital\n“What comes with integrating a new workflow is a lot of hesitancy, so our numbers were pretty low in the beginning,” said Amanda Churape, a specialty care program manager at ZSFG. “A lot of our providers and staff had actually never used Zoom or had never really had experience doing video, so there was a lot of training that needed to be done.”\nSignificant numbers of patients and providers did not have a Zoom-compatible device at all, she said.\n“We started pushing very early on to go to video, and that was a challenge simply because those platforms, at that time, were just poorly developed,” said Jeffrey Glenn, chief operating officer at Neighborhood. “Our visits are 15 minutes apiece, so the providers would tell us, ‘I can’t spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to connect the patient.’ And so early on, they would give up quickly and they would say, ‘I’m just going to call you.’”\nRamping Up Capabilities\nTo assist with the transition to remote provider visits, CHCF — which had funded projects working to expand use of the model even before the pandemic — launched the $6 million Tipping Point for Telehealth Initiative to help FQHCs ramp up their digital capabilities. The initiative included a learning collaborative on how to provide telehealth most effectively, dubbed the Connected Care Accelerator, as well as grants to enable clinics to invest in training and equipment.\nClinics were given flexibility in how they used the money as long as they applied it to expanding their telehealth capacity. Some of the clinics used the money to hire a specialized coordinator, like Churape, who oversees a team of telehealth ambassadors who help set up patients for video visits. First, the ambassadors screen patients to see if they have a device with a camera and access to Wi-Fi or an unlimited data plan. Then the ambassadors teach the patient how to download the application, join the meeting, and troubleshoot audio and video issues.\n“It’s definitely been a learning experience working with different types of patients who are more tech savvy along with those who don’t know where the App Store is or what Wi-Fi is,” Churape said. “What took the most time is actually getting the patient onto the application, teaching them how to download the application, teaching them how to join a meeting.”\nOther FQHCs, including Neighborhood, used the grant money to buy equipment like iPads and rolling workstations to provide virtual visits at their clinics. Medical assistants move the rolling video displays between exam rooms and queue up patient calls, allowing physicians to transition seamlessly back and forth between in-person and telehealth visits.\n“A provider may be in Exam Room A seeing a patient in person, but then when they get done and walk into the next room, there may be a virtual patient sitting on the iPad,” Glenn said. “In the very beginning we felt like we need to have dedicated providers, like 100% telehealth or 100% in-person. Then we graduated to this hybrid model, which we are still employing today.”\nLooking Ahead: A Hybrid Model of Care\nEven with all the work they’ve put in, Neighborhood and ZSFG say most of their telehealth visits are still conducted via telephone. That may be because many of the populations the clinics serve face the greatest barriers to accessing care: the elderly, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency. Uscher-Pines worries that those patients, who are only able to obtain audio telehealth services, may be receiving lower quality care as a result.\n“What’s a little bit concerning is that [these] patients are getting an untested service,” Uscher-Pines said. “It may be that audio-only visits are appropriate for many different use cases, but the literature just isn’t there yet to support when it’s appropriate and when it’s not.”\nGiven the advantages and drawbacks of telehealth, audio, and video, many providers are now calling for a hybrid model of care, offering a mix of in-person and virtual appointments depending on the patient and purpose of the visit.\n“Telehealth quality is really complicated. The question is not ‘Does telehealth work?’ It’s ‘Does telehealth work for this patient population with this condition served in this setting?’” Uscher-Pines said. “With hybrid care models, patients can seek the care that works best for them.”\nWhat’s clear from the RAND report is that the flexibility of telehealth is valuable for many patients and providers, with one-third of visits conducted virtually over a year into the pandemic. Making sure that these appointments, whether they are conducted by phone or video, are accessible, and are of the highest quality, will be critical in ensuring equitable care for patients who face barriers to in-person visits, even after the COVID-19 public health emergency is over.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDana G.

With telemedicine, patients can now receive medical advice, diagnosis, disease management and treatment from the comfort of their homes, increasing their access to care and eliminating physical barriers created by hospital capacity, distance or transportation.\nThis report examines the continued adoption of telemedicine, its applications across various specialties and health care services, and its effects on physician well-being, patient access, and continuity of care. Study findings show that 88% of physicians surveyed believe telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, with many reporting reduced wait times, improved adherence to treatment plans, and decreased no-show rates. Additionally, a consider- able portion of physicians surveyed reported that telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules and positively impacted their feelings of autonomy and work-life balance. Beyond expanding access to health care, telemedicine may also be increasing patients’ willingness to seek medical attention. The majority of all patients surveyed (70%) said they may be more likely to consult with a doctor if they can do so virtually, with convenience and efficiency being primary drivers of adoption. Among patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year, 85% said it resulted in equivalent or superior quality of care, with the majority reporting increased satisfaction. As the digitization of health care continues, telemedicine is poised to main- tain a pivotal role in health care delivery. Telemedicine and in-person care are not mutually exclusive, and uniting both can help reduce costs, expand access, and improve care for everyone. With further identification and im- plementation of best practices, telemedicine’s capacity to personalize care models, promote continuity of care, and improve patient outcomes will only get stronger.\nReport Introduction 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Introduction 03 Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 04 An analysis of fee-for-service Medicare telemedicine claims throughout 2022 revealed that nearly 47% of billing physicians were users of Doximity’s telemedicine platform. In the last quarter of 2022 (October to December) alone, Doximity\'s telemedicine tools were used by over 375,000 unique clinicians.* To gain a deeper understanding of the progression and sustained utilization of telemedicine, Doximity conducted an analysis of how its physician members, across all specialties and practice areas, used its telemedicine tools throughout 2022. To supplement this data, Doximity conducted a survey of over 1,200 of its physician telemedicine users across nine specialties: cardiology, oncology, gastroenterology, nephrology, neurology, endocrinology, rheumatology, pulmonology, and psychiatry.\n*As reported on February 9, 2023 during Doximity’s Fiscal 2023 Fourth Quarter earnings call 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 05 Physician Insights Telemedicine Insights from Doximity\'s Physician Membership 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 06 The metro areas with the highest physician adoption of Doximity’s telemedicine platform in 2022 ranged across all regions of the U.S. New York had the highest overall adoption of telemedicine among physicians, followed by Chicago and Boston.\nMetro Areas with the HIGHEST HIGHEST Adoption 1.

This trend may be attributed to telemedicine’s ability to promote continuity of care and long-term patient-physician relationships. Among all physicians surveyed, over 83% reported they found telemedicine useful in enhancing continuity of care for patients with complex or chronic conditions, and nearly two-thirds (65%) said telemedicine improved communication with their patients. 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 08 Adoption by Specialty Adoption of Telemedicine Highest in Specialties that Manage Chronic Illness 1.

With telemedicine, patients now have access to subspecialists which may not be available in their area. In addition, follow ups for things like adjusting a heart failure therapy can be done via telemedicine, eliminating the need for patients to drive long distances for a short office visit. Over the past few years, we’ve learned telemedicine is not a replacement, but a complement to our practices. – Munir Janmohamed, MD, Medical Director Heart Failure, Dignity Health Medical Foundation 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 09 As health care becomes more digitized, physicians across specialties are integrating telemedicine into their practices. In a survey of Doximity\'s telemedicine users, nearly 84% of physicians reported using telemedicine at least weekly, with 40% incorporating it into their daily clinical practice. The highest reports of daily use were among psych- iatrists at 84%, followed by endocrinologists at 57%. Looking ahead, the increasing popularity of mobile medicine and remote patient monitoring devices — estimated to reach 60.6 million U.S. patients by 20243 —\xad is likely to drive further demand for reliable and complementary telemedicine solutions.\nFrequency of Use Many Physicians Incorporating Telemedicine into Daily, Weekly Practice *May not sum to 100 due to rounding numbers.\nHow often do you use telemedicine (via voice, video, text, etc.) in your practice?* Monthly 11% Quarterly 3% None of the Above 3% Participant None of the Ab Quarterly Monthly Daily Weekly 44% 40% 11% 3% 3% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 1 Daily 40% Weekly 44% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine As physicians lean into digital, they are embracing multiple telemedicine modalities, with video emerging as the most predominant among physicians surveyed. Audio-only phone visits are also widely employed, demonstrating the need for telemedicine tools that are versatile and adaptable to patients’ needs. According to a study published in JAMA Network Open, Medicare patients with less technology access, lack of video experience, Latinx ethnicity, or limited English pro- ficiency, were all more likely to be offered telephone visits compared to video visits.4 These findings underscore the importance of audio-only options and the ongoing need for inclusive, flexible, and accessible telemedicine and product features that meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population.

While one of the most predominant applications among physicians is routine follow-up visits (92% of physicians surveyed), the majority of physicians surveyed (57%) use telemedicine to discuss lab and test results and treatment options with their patients, and this is even higher among oncologists (70%). Telemedicine also offers an important channel for prescription refills and timely follow-ups after a missed in-person visit, while playing a non-trivial role in remote patient monitoring, patient triage and urgent care. Notably, a recent study conducted by Epic Research found that most patients who had a telemedicine visit did not require an in-person follow-up appointment within the same specialty for three months. These findings suggest that telemedicine can provide effective medical attention without the need for additional in-person visits.5 Adoption by Use Case Telemedicine\'s Role Extends Beyond Routine Care How Physicians Apply Telemedicine in Clinical Practice: Routine Follow-Up Patient Visits Patient Consults Patient Triage Remote Patient Monitoring Test Results and Treatment Options Follow-Ups After Missed In-Person Visits Medication Management Urgent Care 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 12 While the pandemic certainly increased telemedicine use, the opportunity for better time management could help explain its continued adoption. Two-thirds of all physicians surveyed (66%) reported at least one time management benefit, such as greater autonomy and work-life balance, increased productivity, and easier schedule management. In fact, the majority of physicians surveyed reported telemedicine has improved their ability to manage their schedules. As physicians continue to navigate burnout and overwork, these benefits could drive even greater adoption of telemedicine in the future.\nEffects on Productivity, Work-Life Balance Physicians Report Better Time Management ""Telemedicine has made it easier to manage my schedule."" ""Telemedicine helps me be more productive and better serve my patients."" ""Telemedicine has provided me with greater autonomy and work-life balance."" ""Telemedicine helps me to provide care to more patients per day."" Physician-Reported Benefits of Telemedicine Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 13 Telemedicine is also instrumental in addressing the costly and disruptive issue of patient no-shows for doctor visits. Approximately 61% of physicians surveyed reported a reduction in their patient no-show rates as a result of telemedicine, likely due to the increased convenience, accessibility, and flexibility of virtual care visits. Importantly, 77% of physicians said they have observed either equivalent or improved patient adherence to treatment plans through telemedicine, with less than 2% reporting decreased adherence.\nEffects on Patient Visit, Treatment Adherence Reduces No-Show Rates, Improves or Maintains Adherence to Treatment Plans How has telemedicine affected your patients\' adherence to treatment plans?* Not applicable 1 Not applicable 1% Decreased adherence 2% Unsure 21% Increased adherence 37% No change 40% 1 Decreased adherence 2% No change in adherence 40% Increased adherence 37% *May not sum to 100, due to rounding numbers.\nUnsure 21% Not applicable 1% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report 14 Patient access also appears to be a leading contributor to telemedicine adoption. Nearly 88% of physicians surveyed said telemedicine has increased patient access to health care, particularly among populations that may have faced barriers to care previously. Similarly, 87% of physicians reported telemedicine has enabled them to provide care to patients who face obstacles visiting their office in person. As additional benefits, nearly 44% of physicians found that telemedicine has actually reduced wait times for their patients, while 41% said telemedicine has expanded their community reach and referral networks.\nEffects on Patient Access Physicians Report Improved Access, Reduced Wait Times for Patients Physicians Who Agree Telemedicine Has Increased Patient Access to Health Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree 88 Neutral 10 Disagree 3 Disagree 3% Neutral 10% Agree 87% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Approximately 92% of physicians surveyed identified ease of use as a key factor in promoting patient access, followed by cross-device compatibility, allowing access from both desktop and mobile devices. Notably, the majority of physicians surveyed identified the ability to avoid application downloads and login-protected patient portals as important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine.\nFactors Influencing Patient Access Ease of Use, Cross-Device Compatibility Key Attributes for Patient Access Which of the following features are important to ensuring patient access to telemedicine?\nEase of use Accessibility across desktop and mobile No application download required No patient portal log-in required Ability to add family member or care partner Language support (translation or interpreter service) 0 100 75 50 25 92% 81% 71% 56% 55% 42% Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Physician Adoption of Telemedicine 16 As telemedicine’s role in U.S. health care continues to evolve, pay parity and the ability to offer telemedicine services across state lines will continue to be two issues that can greatly impact patient access. Among all physicians surveyed, over 78% indicated they believe there should be pay parity between telemedicine and in-person visits, and nearly 84% said the ability to practice telemedicine across state lines is critical to improving patient access to specialists and other timely care. With a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034,1 telemedicine is likely to play a significant role in promoting patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved areas.\nPolicies to Preserve Patient Access Pay Parity, Licensing Across State Lines Critical to Patient Access Percentage of Physicians Who Agree There Should Be Pay Parity Between Telemedicine and In-Person Visits Percentage of Physicians Who Agree Ability to Practice Telemedicine Across State Lines is Critical to Improving Patient Access to Specialists, Other Timely Care Fundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold Agree Neutral Disagree Disagree 4% Neutral 12% Agree 84% Pie and donut charts compare values from a single category.

Survey respondents included 1,200 patients who identified as having a chronic illness and 1,200 patients who did not. Among all respondents surveyed, the majority reported participating in a telemedicine visit within the last year (between March 2022 to March 2023). The following analyses examine these patients\' direct experiences with telemedicine, as well as broader trends and preferences among the full patient cohort.\nPatient Insights Tracking Patient Perception and Adoption of Telemedicine 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 19 In 2022, telemedicine reached the 80% adoption mark overall, becoming the preferred channel for prescription care and minor illness.6 While this is a significant milestone, the frequency of telemedicine use is also noteworthy. Based on survey results, nearly 60% of patients who had a telemedicine visit in the past year participated in a minimum of three virtual visits. Over one in five (21%) participated in six or more visits, and this frequency was similar among patients with and without chronic illnesses. Further, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported it improved their access to health care services.\nTelemedicine Use Among Patients Patients Report Recurring Use of Telemedicine Within One-Year Period In the past year, how many times did you meet with a doctor virtually?* Has virtual care improved your access to health care services?* *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nFundraiser Results by Salesperson Participant Units Sold 6+ times 21 3-5 times 38 1-2 times 41 41% 38% 21% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Fundrais Participant Unsure No No Change Yes 76% 17% 5% 2% Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold Units Sold 3-5 Times 38% No 5% Unsure 2% 1-2 Times 41% Yes 76% 6+ Times 21% No Change 17% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 20 Patients who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year identified a number of reasons for adoption, with efficiency and convenience being primary drivers. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with their doctors from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to interrupt their daily routines or commute to a doctor\'s office. Importantly, more than one in four patients with a telemedicine visit in the past year reported opting for a virtual visit because they did not believe their situation warranted an in-person appointment. This suggests that telemedicine could play a vital role in ensuring patients less inclined to visit a doctor\'s office still receive timely medical evaluation. In fact, the majority of all patients surveyed (70%) indicated they may be more likely to consult with a doctor in a non-emergency situation if the visit could be conducted virtually.\nFactors Driving Telemedicine Adoption Efficiency, Convenience Leading Drivers of Patient Adoption *Percentages confined to respondents who participated in a telemedicine visit in the past year.\nWhy did you see your doctor virtually within the past year?* Easier than in-person visit (more convenient) Faster than in-person visit Concerns about COVID-19 and other infections Didn\'t feel in-person was needed (didn\'t feel bad enough) Difficulty getting to doctors office Couldn\'t miss work 0 60 45 30 15 53% 43% 31% 27% 26% 16% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 21 Over the past year, patients participated in telemedicine visits to receive a number of health care services, ranging from routine check-ups to appointments to discuss test results and treatment options. While follow-up appointments appear to be one of the primary applications of telemedicine use, this is likely due to the comprehensive nature of these visits, which can encompass various health care services. Among all patients who had a virtual care visit in the past year, approximately one in three patients (34%) used telemedicine to discuss their medications with their doctor or to refill their prescriptions, while roughly one in five used telemedicine to review test or treatment options. Notably, some of the highest use of telemedicine for these services was among patients with chronic illnesses.\nAdoption by Health Care Service Strong Telemedicine Adoption for Routine Visits, Medication Management What type(s) of care have you received virtually in the past year?\nFollow-ups after an in-person visit Regular check-ups Medication management and refills Review of test or lab results Mental health appointments Review of test or treatment options Same-day appointments (non-emergency) Urgent or emergency care Remote monitoring device check-up 0 50 38 25 13 46% 36% 34% 32% 25% 20% 17% 11% 9% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 22 Patients are also embracing a variety of telemedicine modalities to cater to their diverse needs and preferences. These modalities include video consultations, audio-only phone calls, and chat or text messaging. Among all patients surveyed, video emerged as the most preferred modality, with audio- only phone visits closely behind. These relatively strong preferences across modalities underscore the need for adaptable and flexible telemedicine solutions that can promote a positive patient experience for all.\nPreferences by Modality Patients Report Similar Preferences for Video, Audio-Only Visits Which types of virtual care formats do you prefer?\nAll Patients Patients with Telemedicine Visit in Past Year Video Phone (audio only) Chat or text messaging I prefer to meet with my doctor in person 15 0 30 45 60 42% 56% 39% 46% 27% 31% 27% 13% Computer (laptop/desktop) 51% Tablet or iPad 38% Home phone or basic cell phone 20% Wi-Fi or Internet 54% Among all patients surveyed, the majority (77%) reported having regular access to a smartphone, making it the most commonly available device for virtual health care visits. This was followed by computers at 51% and tablets at 38%. Importantly, only 54% of respondents reported having reg- ular access to Wi-Fi, underscoring the need for flexible telemedicine solutions that can easily adapt to meet individual patients’ needs, including adjusting for no or low internet connection. In terms of patient preferences, 60% of respondents indicated a strong preference for using mobile devices for telemedicine visits, with less than one-fourth (24%) reporting a preference for computers.\n2023 State of Telemedicine Report 23 Device Access and Preferences Patients Continue to Favor, Depend on Smartphones Which of the following resources do you have regular access to for virtual health care visits?\nSmartphone 0 20 40 60 80 77% 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Patient Adoption of Telemedicine 24 Consistent with prior year findings, patients continue to report equivalent or superior quality of care as the result of their experience with telemedicine.

Moving forward, uniting telemedicine with in-person care will help personalize care models, promote more equitable access to care, and strengthen the overall health care system for all. By leveraging the advantages of both telemedicine and in-person care, physicians as well as care teams can create flexible and adaptable models that better meet the diverse needs of their patients. This flexibility could also provide much- needed support for physicians and other medical professionals, as they continue to navigate a complex and evolving health care landscape.\nConclusion, Methodology & Sources Conclusion 27 2023 State of Telemedicine Report Conclusion, Methodology & Sources 28 Physician Insights Medicare Telemedicine Insights: Doximity partnered with CareJourney, a health analytics organization, to measure the number of physicians billing a set of Medicare telemedicine codes throughout 2022.

COVID-19 patients who were isolated and received HBIC were monitored through telephone consultations (TC), in-person TC visits, and a self-reporting application. By evaluating patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC, healthcare providers could gauge the effectiveness and efficiency of the HBIC program.\nMethods: A cross-sectional study design enrolled 444 HBIC patients who answered a structured questionnaire. A binary logistic regression model assessed the association between independent variables and patient satisfaction. The length of stay in HBIC was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. The data collection started on April (1–30), 2022, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\nResults: The median age was 34, and 247 (55.6%) were females. A greater proportion (313, 70.5%) of the participants had high satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AOR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those who were symptomatic (AOR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were found to be significant factors for high user satisfaction. Higher frequency of calls (>3 calls) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and more in-person visits (>1 visit) (AHR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001) had greater chances to reduce the length of stay in the COVID-19 HBIC.\nConclusion: 70.5% of the participants had high satisfaction with the system, and frequent phone call follow-ups on patients’ clinical status can significantly improve their satisfaction and length of recovery. An in-person visit is also an invaluable factor in a patient’s recovery.\n1 Introduction\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on numerous countries, resulting in a staggering number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide. Specifically, 774,771,942 confirmed cases and 7,035,337 deaths were reported globally. In Africa, approximately 9,576,309 confirmed cases and 175,500 deaths have been recorded, whereas Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths (1). Given the outbreak’s severity and the prevailing epidemiological situation, the Federal Ministry of Health of Ethiopia has taken swift action by developing, approving, and implementing a national guide on home-based isolation and care (HBIC). This guide is tailored for asymptomatic and mildly confirmed COVID-19 cases (2). Consequently, many patients have enrolled in the system, establishing a comprehensive telephone consultation (TC) service. Healthcare workers from health centers have been diligently monitoring the clinical condition of these patients through regular phone calls or in-person visits (2). The national or regional COVID-19 emergency centers are available for assistance to ensure that patients receive the necessary support and information. Patients facing challenges or requiring guidance on the system’s functioning, worsening symptoms, medication advice, or ambulance requests can reach these centers (2). This approach provides comprehensive care and support to individuals affected by COVID-19 in Ethiopia.\nSeveral studies have emphasized the utilization of teleconsultations (TC) in Sub-Saharan Africa amid the COVID-19 outbreak. For instance, a study conducted at the Aga Khan Hospital in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, revealed varying frequencies of TC calls over 3\u2009months, with peaks observed at 7\u2009weeks and lows at 13\u2009weeks (3). In Uganda, the Ministry of Health rolled out TC services across multiple health centers simultaneously (4). Similarly, in Cameroon, many physicians resorted to TC consultations during the pandemic, often using WhatsApp applications (5). Despite the progress in telemedicine practices, assessing the quality of care provided through these methods is crucial. Quality indicators for telemedicine outcomes include mortality rates, average length of stay, and complication rates (6). The adoption of telemedicine has played a pivotal role in enhancing the quality of diagnosis and treatment in primary public hospitals (7). This is evident in the reduction of treatment duration, decrease in the average length of hospital stays, and decline in the percentage of critically ill patients (8). Moreover, telemedicine aids in improving personalized care and broadening the accessibility of medical services. Healthcare providers can deliver more efficient and effective patient care by harnessing telemedicine, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (9, 10). Patient satisfaction is a significant indicator of the societal perception of healthcare services, particularly in telemedicine. The practical advantages of telemedicine further underscore its social reputation within primary healthcare facilities. First, Telemedicine plays a crucial role in alleviating the financial burden on patients and their families by eliminating expenses associated with transportation and accommodation (11). Second, the efficient nature of telemedicine expedites disease diagnosis and treatment, thereby mitigating patients’ suffering (11). Lastly, telemedicine’s unique “face-to-face” communication system fosters a novel connection between medical professionals and patients, ultimately enhancing the healthcare experience (12, 13). Despite numerous studies, the findings remain inconclusive and conflicting. Some researchers suggested recruiting adaptable patients who embrace this new technology’s convenience (14). Conversely, others highlight limitations, such as the relative novelty of telehealth in medicine, which makes it challenging to compare its outcomes with those of more traditional interventions (15). In addition, patient satisfaction is a complex and multifaceted concept influenced by various factors. However, the factors influencing patient satisfaction in different settings or conditions remain debated (15).\nPatient satisfaction and length of stay are crucial metrics for assessing the quality of healthcare programs. This study aimed to provide insights into the factors influencing the satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC of COVID-19 patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This study uses traditional care (TC) and hybrid (in-person-TC) approaches in different sub-city areas. By understanding these factors, policymakers can develop strategic plans to improve the quality of healthcare services, thereby ensuring high satisfaction levels and shorter medical residence stays. The findings of this study can also inform the National Public Health Emergency Operation Center and the Federal Ministry of Health in Ethiopia on how to intervene and strengthen the healthcare system. In addition, the results can contribute to expanding telemedicine services and adopting digital health technologies in the country’s healthcare sector.\n2 Methods\n2.1 Study area\nThis study focuses on Addis Ababa, primarily because of the significant burden of COVID-19 cases. Ethiopia alone has reported 501,157 confirmed cases and 7,574 deaths, with nearly 67% of these cases originating in Addis Ababa (1). Moreover, implementing the COVID-19 HBIC model in Addis Ababa surpasses other regions. Furthermore, the HBIC’s self-reporting and follow-up application is exclusively available in Addis Ababa, making it an ideal location for research. Addis Ababa is divided into 11 sub-cities [Addis Ketema, Akaky Kaliti, Arada, Bole, Gullele, Kirkos, Kolfe Keranio, Lideta, Nefas Silk-Lafto, Yeka, Lemi Kura (New)], all of which have adopted the HBIC system for COVID-19 patients since the initial case was identified. The digital follow-up tool was specifically launched in the Bole sub-city (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Addis Ababa district locations. This map of the 11 Addis Ababa sub-cities is included in this study. Lemi Kura is a new district and is not included in this map.\n2.2 Study period\nThe study was conducted from 1 to 30 April 2022 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.3 Telemedicine medical team and technology\nEach sub-city is equipped with two to four health centers that serve as the base for the telemedicine medical team. A well-established system ensures that patient data is promptly transmitted to follow-up teams, enabling healthcare workers to initiate their follow-up procedures without delay. To support this initiative, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Addis Ababa Health Bureau allocated a tablet with complimentary airtime to each sub-city proportionate to the needs of the telemedicine medical team.\n2.4 Population studied\nThis study encompasses all individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 who were isolated, received care at home, and met the criteria for inclusion. The study population consisted of confirmed COVID-19 cases admitted to HBIC from its inception, aged between 18 and 60, individuals who underwent regular follow-up assessments while at HBIC, and those whose contact information was documented in the registry.\n2.5 Patient’s independent variables\nPatients were classified based on the following criteria: Gender (male, female), Age (<30, 31–40, 41–50, 51–60\u2009years), city of residence, education level (no education and elementary, secondary and diploma, degree and above), occupation (government employee, private employee, self-employee, not working), symptoms (asymptomatic, symptomatic), type of attention (only telephone call—TC, telephone call with in-person visits - in-person-TC), frequency of calls (≤2 calls, ≥3 calls), and frequency of in-person visits (no visits, ≤2 visits, ≥3 visits).\n2.6 Study design\nA cross-sectional research design assessed two primary variables: patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC in days. The formula for a single population proportion was applied to determine the required population size of 385 (with a Z-score of 1.96, an outcome proportion of 50%, and a marginal error of 5%). The technique of proportionate stratified sampling involved dividing the entire population into 11 strata or sub-cities. The total sample size was then distributed proportionally among each sub-city based on the burden of the disease. Study participants were selected from each stratum or sub-city using systematic probability sampling (Figure 2).\nFigure 2. Data collection. Sampling technique from each sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.\n2.7 Data collection tools, techniques, and quality assurance\nA validated patient satisfaction survey from the teleneurology program in Chile (13) employed a Likert scale to assess the extent of patient satisfaction. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data collected, a pretest was conducted on a random sample of 23 (5%) patients. Based on the findings from the pretest, necessary amendments were made to the data collection tool. Additionally, the collected data underwent daily reviews for clarity and completeness checks. Before analysis, the internal consistency of the questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha test (13). The local language was used during data collection to ensure the required information was collected with greater understanding. To facilitate this, the data collection questionnaire was first developed in English and then translated into Amharic, and the data collected were back-translated to English for consistency. The data collectors administered the questionnaire over the telephone, and responses were recorded on the individual datasheets. Training on the basics of the questionnaire and how to use it appropriately was given by the principal investigator for two BSc nurses for 2\u2009days.\n2.8 Patient satisfaction survey\nThe final questionnaire consisted of 17 closed-response questions, each assigned a numerical value ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The questions were categorized into four contextualized areas. The overall score on the questionnaire, with a maximum of 85 points, served as an indicator of patient satisfaction. The scoring system classified satisfaction levels as follows: very low (17 points or below), low (18–34 points), moderate (35–51 points), high (52–68 points), and very high (69–85 points). Following completion of the survey, patients were divided into two main groups based on their scores: (i) those with a score below 51 points, indicating moderate or low patient satisfaction, and (ii) those with a score over 52 points, indicating high or very high patient satisfaction (Table 1).\nTable 1. Study questionnaire.\r\n\n2.9 Data and outcomes analysis\nSummary statistics, including frequency, percentage, median, and interquartile range, were utilized to summarize the characteristics of patients and other relevant information. This research aimed to assess the relationship between the independent variables and two primary outcomes: (i) the level of patient satisfaction and (ii) the length of stay in the HBIC. The binary logistic regression (Backwald) model was employed to examine the independent variables associated with patient satisfaction, and the findings were presented as odds ratios (OR). Cox regression (Backwald) analysis was conducted to evaluate the independent variables linked to the length of stay in HBIC, and the results were reported as hazard ratios (HR). To compare the means of length of stay in HBIC, a non-normal distribution, the Mann–Whitney U test for independent samples was employed, while the chi-square test was used for categorical variables. The significance level was set at p\u2009<\u20090.05. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 26.\n2.10 Ethical considerations\nThe study was conducted after obtaining ethical clearance from the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee. Oral informed consent was obtained from the participants before any form of data collection. Participants’ contact information was obtained after a formal request was made to the Addis Ababa Health Bureau. Demographic data of all participants and survey responses were anonymously collected and entered. Access to the collected information was limited to the authors, and confidentiality was maintained throughout the project.\n3 Results\n3.1 Data collection\nA 17-question structured questionnaire was developed by reviewing similar studies (Table 1) (13). Upon completing a reliability assessment of the survey, the internal reliability of the survey was robust, as evidenced by a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.96 (data not shown). The study included 509 patients, yielding a response rate of 87.2% (n\u2009=\u2009444). Among the non-respondents (n\u2009=\u200965, 12.8%), the reasons provided for their lack of participation were as follows: 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) had incorrect contact information, and another 20% (n\u2009=\u200913) did not receive any follow-up, either in-person or through phone communication. The remaining 60% (n\u2009=\u200939) of participants displayed uncooperative behavior, as their phones were inactive, unreachable, or did not answer (Figure 3).\nFigure 3. Patient’s response from telephone calls. Response rate and reasons for non-response include: (i) wrong phone number, (ii) no follow-up, and (iii) other.\n3.2 Population description, patient satisfaction, and length of stay in HBIC\nThe descriptive statistics of the 444 patients who participated in the study are below. The median age was 34\u2009±\u200915\u2009years, with an age distribution as follows: Age:<30 (n\u2009=\u2009164, 36.9%); 31–40 (n\u2009=\u2009141, 31.8%); 41–50 (n\u2009=\u200987, 19.6%); and 51–60 (n\u2009=\u200952, 11.7%). The gender distribution of the patients was as follows: Female 247 (55.6%) (Table 2). We outline the performance of the HBIC system according to the patient satisfaction parameter. Due to the low frequency obtained in the lower user satisfaction groups (very low, low, and moderate), we grouped patients into two major groups according to the degree of user satisfaction: low or moderate and high or very high. patients with high or very high user satisfaction represent 313 (70.5%). When we break down this group by gender, we see that women have a slightly higher percentage of high or very high user satisfaction than men, with 177 (56.9%) females. However, no statistically significant differences are observed. Analyzing the distribution of patients with high and very high user satisfaction by age, we observe that more than 50% of patients are concentrated in a population under 40\u2009years old (Table 2). The length of stay for patients with high or very high satisfaction varied depending on certain variables. The average length of stay for females was 15\u2009±\u20095\u2009days, while for males, it was 16\u2009±\u20095\u2009days, and in terms of age groups, patients showed similar lengths between 14 and 16 days (Table 2).\nTable 2. Patient’s demographic variables.\r\n\nThe distribution of patients according to sub-city of residence was found to be quite homogeneous, with some exceptions as detailed below: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200962, 14.0%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Arada (n\u2009=\u200943, 9.7%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200977, 17.3%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200959, 13.3%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u200911, 2.5%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200944, 9.9%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200936, 8.1%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200922, 5.0%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u200916, 3.6%). Patients with high or very high satisfaction were distributed according to sub-city of residence as follows: City: Addis Ketema (n\u2009=\u200948, 10.8%), Akaki Kality (n\u2009=\u200935), Arada (n\u2009=\u200932, 7.2%), Bole (n\u2009=\u200957, 12.8%), Gulele (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%, 7.9%), Kirkos (n\u2009=\u20096, 1.4%), Kolfe Keranyo (n\u2009=\u200933, 7.4%), Lideta (n\u2009=\u200923, 5.2%), Nefas Silk Lafto (n\u2009=\u200920, 4.5%), Yeka (n\u2009=\u200918, 4.1%), and Lemi Kura (n\u2009=\u20098, 1.8%) (Table 2). Regarding the city of origin, the average length of stay varied as follows: Addis Ketema (17\u2009±\u20095), Akaki Kality (16\u2009±\u20098), Arada (16\u2009±\u20095), Bole (14\u2009±\u20093), Gulele (17\u2009±\u20094), Kirkos (17\u2009±\u20095), Kolfe Keranyo (16\u2009±\u20096), Lideta (14\u2009±\u20094), Nefas Silk Lafto (20\u2009±\u20097), Yeka (15\u2009±\u20097), and Lemi Kura (14\u2009±\u20097) (Table 2).\nThe patient’s satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC can be influenced by various factors, including the patient’s level of education and occupation. The distribution of patients’ education level is as follows: 79 patients (17.8%) had no education or only completed elementary school, 174 patients (39.2%) had completed secondary school or obtained a diploma, and 191 patients (43.0%) had a degree or higher education. The distribution of patients’ occupation is as follows: 121 patients (27.3%) were government employees, 114 patients (25.7%) were private employees, 120 patients (25.0%) were self-employed, and 89 patients (20.0%) were not working (Table 2). The majority of patients who showed high or very high user satisfaction have higher levels of education: Education: No Educ and Elementary (n\u2009=\u200945, 10.1%), Secondary and Diploma (n\u2009=\u2009125, 28.2%), Degree and above (n\u2009=\u2009143, 32.2%); however, the distribution was found to be more symmetrical according to the occupational level of these patients: Government employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.0%), Private employee (n\u2009=\u200985, 19.1%), Self-employee (n\u2009=\u200980, 18.1%), Not working (n\u2009=\u200968, 15.3%) (Table 2). No significant differences were found in the duration length of stay in HBIC among patients concerning their level of education and occupation type. The respective data for education are as follows: No Education and Elementary 14\u2009±\u20097, Secondary and Diploma 15\u2009±\u20094, Degree and above 17\u2009±\u20095. Similarly, the data for occupation type were: Government employee 14\u2009±\u20095, Private employee 15\u2009±\u20095, Self-employee 16\u2009±\u20094, Not working 18\u2009±\u20097 (Table 2).\nMost patients who participated in this study were symptomatic, accounting for 275 (61.9%) with an average length of stay for HBIC of 16 (±6). Patients who displayed symptoms were more satisfied (n\u2009=\u2009215, 48.5%) than those who were asymptomatic (n\u2009=\u200998, 22.1%). The length of stay in HBIC for asymptomatic patients (14\u2009±\u20095), was slightly lower than that of Symptomatic patients (16\u2009±\u20095). However, no statistically significant differences were observed (data not shown).\nNext, we described the frequency of phone call follow-ups for patients during their stay at HBIC. The most common type of care was TC, with 330 patients (74.3%), followed by in-person and TC visits, with 114 patients (25.7%). The overall frequency of in-person visits was 1\u2009±\u20092 visits, and it can be further broken down as follows: no visits (n\u2009=\u2009330, 48.9%), ≤2 visits (n\u2009=\u200984, 18.9%), and\u2009≥\u20093 visits (n\u2009=\u200930, 6.8%). The average frequency of phone call follow-ups was 3\u2009±\u20096 calls, and we observe that the distribution of calls appears to be symmetrical: TC was ≤2 calls (n\u2009=\u2009221, 49.8%) and\u2009≥\u20093 calls (n\u2009=\u2009223, 50.2%).\nIn terms of the mode of care, patients who were exclusively contacted through teleconsultation (TC) 217 (48.9%) were more satisfied than those receiving hybrid care with both TC and in-person visits 96 (21.6%). Consistent with the findings, patients exhibited higher user satisfaction with an increased frequency of calls in TC, as those patients with more than ≥3 calls (n\u2009=\u2009184, 41.4%) expressed greater satisfaction compared to patients with less than or equal to ≤2 calls (n\u2009=\u2009129, 29.1%) (Table 2). Upon analyzing the frequency of in-person visits, patients with fewer visits reported higher user satisfaction: No visits (n\u2009=\u2009217, 69.3%), 1 visit (n\u2009=\u200970, 22.0%), and\u2009≥\u20092 visits (n\u2009=\u200926, 8.3%).\nIt is important to mention that differences in patient length of stay were observed according to the type of care, as patients treated through the TC system 14\u2009±\u20095 stayed for a shorter period than those receiving hybrid care through TC and in-person visits 18\u2009±\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05). As expected, patients with more calls stayed longer in the HBIC system as described below: Frequency of calls in TC: ≤2 calls 13\u2009±\u20093, and\u2009≥\u20093 calls 18\u2009±\u20096 (p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Table 2).\n3.3 Statistical analysis associated with patient satisfaction\nA binary logistic regression analysis was utilized to explore the variables associated with high or very high patient satisfaction levels. The results revealed that individuals who placed more than three calls (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000) and those displaying symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002) were more inclined to report increased satisfaction. Nevertheless, no statistically significant relationships were found between user satisfaction and the other independent variables investigated (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 3).\nTable 3. Relevant demographic variables that influence patient satisfaction.\r\n\n3.4 Statistical analysis associated with patient length of stay in HBIC\nA Cox regression analysis was employed to examine the factors influencing the duration of hospital stays in patients who reported high levels of satisfaction. The findings revealed that patients who made more than three phone calls had a significantly lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000), indicating a greater likelihood of reducing their length of stay. Similarly, patients with more in-person visits also exhibited a lower hazard ratio (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). However, no statistically significant associations were observed between the length of stay and the other independent variables analyzed (p\u2009>\u20090.05) (Table 4).\nTable 4. Cox regression analysis to elucidate the demographic variables associated with the length of stay in HBIC and patients’ satisfaction.\r\n\n3.5 Statistical analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC\nPreviously, we identified the following variables that significantly influence patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC: the presence of symptoms, the number of phone calls, and in-person follow-ups. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between symptoms and patient satisfaction with the number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups (Table 5). It was noted that symptomatic patients with low or moderate satisfaction levels have an OR\u2009=\u20095.7 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and 7.6 times higher likelihood of having in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was notably longer for those with a higher number of phone calls. Conversely, patients with high or very high satisfaction levels have a 2.3 times higher likelihood of having a greater number of phone calls and in-person follow-ups. The length of stay in HBIC for these patients was significantly longer for those with in-person follow-up. Sig p\u2009<\u20090.05 (Table 5).\nTable 5. Analysis of the variables affecting patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC.\r\n\n4 Discussion\nThis study aimed to evaluate the levels of patient satisfaction and length of stay in HBIC among COVID-19 patients while also examining the different factors that may impact these outcomes. Given the considerable number of COVID-19-positive instances and the limited bed availability at COVID-19-specific hospitals, the HBIC endorsed the practice of home isolation for COVID-19-affected persons. This directive was instituted because most COVID-19 patients were either asymptomatic or displayed mild symptoms. Such cases generally do not necessitate hospitalization at COVID-19-designated medical facilities and can be adequately managed at home with appropriate medical guidance and monitoring. The heightened level of patient satisfaction observed in symptomatic individuals treated by HBIC is supported by an associated investigation conducted through a survey-based study (10, 16–18).\nWe identified a noteworthy connection between a high or very high satisfaction level and the frequency of phone call follow-ups in patients with COVID-19 symptoms. Essentially, for each increment of one in the frequency of phone call follow-ups, the chances of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction rose by a factor of 2.8 (OR\u2009=\u20092.827, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.798, 4.443, p\u2009=\u20090.000). This tendency may be attributed to patients encountering difficulties during their healthcare facility stay, and regular communication with the follow-up team assists in addressing some of these challenges. As per the National HBIC Guideline, the frequency of phone call follow-ups escalates as the severity of the COVID-19 illness worsens, with follow-ups occurring once a week, every 3\u2009days until discharge, and daily until discharge (19). Correspondingly, individuals exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms had 2.0 times greater odds of experiencing high or very high patient satisfaction than those with asymptomatic disease (OR\u2009=\u20092.001, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.289, 3.106, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Cox regression analysis uncovered a negative correlation between the length of stay in HBIC patients with high or very high satisfaction and the frequency of phone calls, follow-ups, and in-person visits. Specifically, the number of phone calls and in-person visits (with a minimum of two visits) emerged as significant factors impacting the length of stay. Upon adjusting for other variables, it was observed that with each additional phone call, the length of stay in the hospital-based isolation center (HBIC) decreased by 46.3% (HR\u2009=\u20090.537, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.415, 0.696, p\u2009=\u20090.000). Similarly, after accounting for other covariates, the length of stay among COVID-19 patients who had more than one in-person visit was 50.5% lower compared to patients with no in-person visits (HR\u2009=\u20090.495, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.322, 0.762, p\u2009=\u20090.001). Finally, this investigation determined that symptomatic patients with Low or Moderate satisfaction had a greater likelihood of experiencing a larger Number of Phone Calls, In-Person follow-ups, and a longer stay at HBIC compared to patients with high or very high satisfaction.\nUser satisfaction and length of stay have shown dissimilar results in different latitudes. A study conducted in general and university hospitals in the Netherlands found no evidence of a correlation between the average length of stay in hospital wards and patient satisfaction (20). Several studies conducted at the Nancy University Hospital Center in France and in training hospitals in Turkey and Japan (21–23) have found a connection between prolonged lengths of stay and decreased patient satisfaction. These studies have highlighted the importance of environmental factors in influencing patient satisfaction (24). However, a distinct study carried out in teaching hospitals in Turkey discovered that patients who stayed longer expressed higher satisfaction levels than those with shorter stays (25). Despite these variations, one can speculate about the reasons for higher user satisfaction in patients with greater follow-ups. Among these reasons, it can be argued that it is well-documented that telemedicine technology has the potential to enhance the quality of primary medical care, shorten the duration of treatment, and decrease the number of severe hospitalization cases (17). Telemedicine expands the availability of medical services and broadens the range of medical care, which is particularly crucial in Ethiopia, with a fragmented healthcare system and limited coverage (26, 27). The sharing of medical resources is especially significant for rural or isolated areas, and telemedicine offers a greater abundance of advanced medical resources for primary hospital consultations in these vast rural regions, thereby enhancing the quality of medical and healthcare services (10, 28, 29).\nThe incorporation of telemedicine into the healthcare systems of low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as Ethiopia, has the potential to bring about cost savings and resource conservation in the long run. Consequently, this could alleviate the financial burden on individuals and enhance their access to affordable healthcare services (17). It is important to note that in many LMICs, a significant portion of overall health spending comes from out-of-pocket payments, as there is often no general health insurance available (30). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the already fragile healthcare systems in LMICs (10, 31). In this regard, telemedicine services could be crucial in relieving pressure on the healthcare system by saving time and resources and enhancing efficiency and accessibility. Additionally, telemedicine can facilitate social distancing measures and reduce the need for face-to-face interactions in hospitals and clinics, helping prevent the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 through physical contact (10, 32). Furthermore, telemedicine can also be instrumental in providing counseling and specific advice to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as guidance on prevention measures. Overall, the adoption of telemedicine in LMICs holds great potential for addressing healthcare challenges, reducing costs, and improving access to quality care. It can serve as a valuable tool in mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening healthcare systems in these countries (33).\nThroughout the initial three waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, most patients seeking medical care were directed to the HBIC. This strategic decision is believed to have effectively alleviated the potential burden of cases and prevented burnout among the existing treatment facilities (2). The HBIC specifically caters to COVID-19 patients and represents our country’s pioneering national telehealth service. Therefore, it is crucial to examine its operational experiences thoroughly. The focus should be on integrating functionalities that encourage community acceptance of this telehealth modality. As COVID-19 patients continue to be enrolled in the HBIC, the findings from this study will serve as a valuable resource for the Ministry of Health and COVID-19 response teams in their efforts to enhance the healthcare system. The HBIC framework offers a practical solution for healthcare providers who aim to extend their services to patients residing in remote areas. Moreover, the growing acceptance and familiarity with telemedicine visits, driven by the pandemic, are likely to shape the future landscape of healthcare delivery for both patients and providers.\nThe study’s findings should be evaluated considering the strengths and limitations identified. The study’s strength lies in the thorough selection process of participants from various sub-cities throughout the entire duration of the service. The research questions were also carefully developed using a validated tool and assessed for internal consistency, ensuring their comprehensibility.\n4.1 Limitations\nIt is important to acknowledge a limitation of the study, which is the potential recall bias introduced by enrolling most patients during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this limitation, this study is expected to pave the way for advancements in telemedical services in Ethiopia. Furthermore, it can potentially expand and incorporate other telemedicine care modalities, such as videoconferencing, in the future.\n5 Conclusion\nThe investigation evaluated patient satisfaction and length of stay in telemedicine services. The findings revealed that most patients, accounting for over 70.5%, reported high or very high satisfaction with these services. Notably, patients who received frequent follow-up phone calls and exhibited symptomatic COVID-19 disease expressed higher satisfaction. Additionally, it was observed that a higher frequency of phone calls and in-person visits resulted in a shorter stay in the Hospital-Based Isolation Center (HBIC). Consequently, it is crucial to consider the aforementioned factors to enhance patient satisfaction and reduce the length of stay in HBIC or other telemedicine services. It is worth mentioning that the HBIC, which caters specifically to COVID-19 patients, represents the first large-scale national telemedicine service implemented in our country. Therefore, it is imperative to thoroughly examine the experiences gained from this service, with particular attention given to incorporating features that facilitate community acceptance and reimbursement of this mode of healthcare delivery. Meanwhile, as the enrollment of COVID-19 patients in the HBIC continues, the findings of this study will serve as a valuable resource for guiding the Ministry of Health, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, and the COVID-19 response team in their efforts to improve the system.\nData availability statement\nThe original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/Supplementary material, further inquiries can be directed to the corresponding authors.\nEthics statement\nThe studies involving humans were approved by the Addis Ababa Health Bureau Public Health Research and Emergency Ethical Review Committee.

On national health systems, most of the financing comes from general taxation, whereas in social health insurance systems, financing typically comes from a combination of payroll contributions and taxation.

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2). The multi-payer SHI system currently consists of 103 sickness funds and 41 PHI companies, and the three biggest sickness funds cover more than one third of the German population.”\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n“In Germany, 88\xa0percent of the population is covered by statutory health insurance, which is financed by financially and organizationally independent statutory health insurance funds, and 9\xa0percent of the population is privately insured.15\xa0The guiding principle of the German statutory health insurance system is solidarity regarding both income and provision of services: All insured people contribute a share of their income, irrespective of their health risk, and people are entitled to benefits according to their health needs, irrespective of their socioeconomic status, ability to pay, or location.16\xa0All employed people earning less than the opt-out threshold, people receiving welfare benefits, and pensioners have mandatory statutory health insurance, and their nonearning dependents are insured free of charge. People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance. Coverage of services is roughly the same in both systems, apart from certain newly launched drugs, which are paid for by private insurance. There is no restriction on patients’ choice of hospitals, and patient copays for hospital stays do not differ across hospitals.”\nSource: Esra Eren Bayindir\xa0and\xa0Jonas Schreyögg. Public Reporting Of Hospital Quality Measures Has Not Led To Overall Quality Improvement: Evidence From Germany. Health Affairs\xa02023\xa042:4,\xa0566-574\n“The German health system has a complex governance structure. The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee – the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.“The states (Bundesländer) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).”\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n“The German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system’s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004–2014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004–2014 compared to the 1994–2004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\xa0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.”\nRice, Thomas et al. “Revisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.” BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n“In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut für Prävention und Aufklärung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany’s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.”\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).“Health insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, € 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).”\nSource: Blümel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i–273.\n“Health insurance coverage is mandatory for the entire population. Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was €50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.”\nSource: Stefan Greß. “Germany.” In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers—that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.“Within the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies—for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.“The Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.”\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

Its tasks include developing laws and drawing up administrative guidelines for the self-governing activities within the health care system. The Ministry of Health directs a number of institutions and agencies responsible for dealing with higher-level issues of public health, such as the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (“Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte” – BfArM) and the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices makes decisions concerning the approval of pharmaceuticals. The Paul Ehrlich Institute is responsible for approving vaccines.“When it comes to matters concerning statutory health insurance, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the highest decision-making body within the self-governing health care system.

Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (“private Krankenversicherung” – PKV).“Funding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.“Principle of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill – regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (“Beitragsbemessungsgrenze”). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.“Principle of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (“Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss” or G-BA – please also see below: “Structure and institutions of the health care system”) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.” \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

Health insurance is compulsory, but people with an income above a fixed threshold or belonging to a particular professional group (e.g. self-employed people or civil servants) can opt out of SHI coverage and enrol in (substitutive) private health insurance (PHI). About 11 % of the population are covered by PHI; 89 % by SHI. Although coverage is universal for all legal residents and only 0.1 % of the population do not have health insurance, there are still gaps due to financial or administrative barriers (see Section 5.2).

People with high income and self-employed people can purchase private health insurance or keep the statutory health insurance.

The federal government defines only the legal framework, while regulatory details are specified in directives issued by the Federal Joint Committee – the highest self-governing decision-making body in the country. The Committee consists of representatives of associations of sickness funds, physicians, dentists and hospitals, as well as three independent members (plus patient representatives without voting rights). It takes decisions on SHI benefits, reimbursement systems and quality assurance.“The states (Bundesländer) supervise the self-governing bodies at the regional level and are responsible for hospital planning and investments, as well as medical education. They are also responsible for public health services and the running of public health offices, which gained in importance during the COVID-19 crisis. At the same time, the crisis revealed the challenges faced by federal systems in coordinating and managing the pandemic. Governance mechanisms have been put in place to enable rapid, cross-state measures to respond to the crisis through ordinance authorisations, particularly by the Federal Ministry of Health (Box 1).”\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n“The German system provides universal population coverage either through social health insurance (SHI) (almost 90% of the population) or substitutive VHI [Voluntary Health Insurance]. As OOP [Out-Of-Pocket] policies of substitutive VHI vary widely (and data is largely unavailable), we focus on SHI. OOP spending in Germany is related to both direct payments for services not covered by SHI (e.g., over-the-counter drugs) and cost-sharing for SHI covered services, but the relative importance of cost-sharing versus direct payments is not known because of the health system’s accounting methods. OOP spending above reference prices for dental care and medical aids can be substantial; for example, reference prices for dental care cover only about 50% of the costs of standard care. Cost-sharing requirements increased in 2004 for such things as prescription drugs, inpatient care, and physician and dental care, while at the same time adult eyeglasses were excluded from coverage. Since these increased requirements became effective in 2004 they do not affect the average growth rate in the 2004–2014 period and therefore do not contradict the observed drop in average growth in 2004–2014 compared to the 1994–2004 period. The most plausible explanation for the low growth in this period is the fact that in 2013, co-payments for physician visits were discontinued. The most important protection mechanism against OOPs is the exemption of children under 18\xa0years of age and a maximum cost-sharing limit of 2% of annual income (or 1% for patients with severe chronic conditions). This has remained largely unchanged over the study period.”\nRice, Thomas et al. “Revisiting out-of-pocket requirements: trends in spending, financial access barriers, and policy in ten high-income countries.” BMC health services research vol. 18,1 371. 18 May. 2018, doi:10.1186/s12913-018-3185-8.\n“In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the German federal government recently orchestrated a fundamental change to its public health infrastructure. This reconstruction centers around the founding of a National Institute for Prevention and Education in Medicine (Bundesinstitut für Prävention und Aufklärung in der Medizin, BIPAM) at the cost of two federal institutions, the Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) and the Federal Center for Health Education (Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung, BzGA). Thus, the Federal Ministry of Health (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit, BMG) plans to dissolve the BzGA and integrate its personnel into the future BIPAM. Further, all RKI research and surveillance activities related to non-communicable diseases, including AI methods development will be transferred into the BIPAM. The RKI responsibilities will solely focus on infectious diseases. According to announced plans of the BMG the primary objective for establishing the BIPAM is to address non-communicable diseases and enhance overall population health. However, the medical specialist training for public health remains non-academic at a state institution. Simultaneously the BMG already replaced two thirds of experts of the permanent commission on vaccination (Ständige Impfkommission, STIKO) and determined new procedures for appointing future expert commissioners. With these changes, Germany embarks on an extraordinary reshuffling of its national public health organizations and responsibilities, by fundamentally separating all issues around non-communicable diseases from those of infectious diseases. Germany’s unraveled research tasks of public health authorities however remains unmet. Thus, 2024 marks a pivotal caesura for public health in the modern history of Germany.”\nSource: Savaskan N, Lampl BMJ, Yavuz M, Tinnemann P.

It is the only country in Europe with coexisting SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] and substitutive PHI [Private Health Insurance]. Both schemes are separated along different organizational, regulative and financial lines (Figure 2.1). Care sectors are also separated in terms of organization, governance and financing. Due to separate legislation for individual sectors within public health, ambulatory and inpatient care, as well as in long-term care, there is strong fragmentation of service provision (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).“Health insurance is compulsory for all citizens and permanent residents, with SHI constituting the main source of financing health care. The multi-payer SHI insurance scheme covered 72.8 million people or 87.7% of the population in 2018. Employees above an opt-out threshold of income, € 62 550 in 2020, and certain professional groups, e.g. self-employed or civil servants, can opt to enroll in substitutive PHI. Thus, 8.7 million people (or 10.5% of the population) were covered by substitutive PHI (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG), 2019d; Statistisches Bundesamt, 2019b; Verband der privaten Krankenversicherung, 2019a) (see Section 3.3.1 Coverage for more detail). Another unique feature of the German health care system is that the vast majority of providers serve both insured populations. The few exemptions that are accessible only to those insured under substitutive PHI represent less than 1% of total hospitals in 2018 (Statistisches Bundesamt, 2020g).”\nSource: Blümel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Coverage is virtually universal and less than 1% of the population is not insured. Some groups of people can choose between publicly financed coverage provided through the statutory health insurance scheme and privately financed substitutive coverage provided by private insurers. Access to substitutive private coverage is restricted to civil servants, self-employed individuals and high-income employees (the annual earnings threshold was €50,850 in 2012). These groups may opt out of the statutory scheme, but once they do so the return options are limited. For example, employees may only return to the statutory scheme when their earnings fall below the threshold. Individuals with substitutive private coverage who are older than 55 years are prohibited from returning to the statutory scheme.”\nSource: Stefan Greß. “Germany.” In Voluntary health insurance in Europe: Country experience [Internet].

SHI and PHI (as well as the two long-term care insurance systems) use the same providers—that is, hospitals and physicians treat both statutorily and privately insured patients, unlike those in many other countries.“Within the legal framework set by the Federal Ministry of Health, the Federal Joint Committee has wide-ranging regulatory power to determine the services to be covered by sickness funds and to set quality measures for providers (see below). To the extent possible, coverage decisions are based on evidence from health technology assessments and comparative-effectiveness reviews. The Federal Joint Committee is supported by the Institute for Quality and Efficiency (IQWiG), a foundation legally charged with evaluating the cost-effectiveness of drugs with added therapeutic benefits, and the Institute for Quality and Transparency (IQTiG), which is responsible for intersectoral quality assurance. It has 13 voting members: five from the Federal Association of Sickness Funds, two each from the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation, one from the Federal Association of SHI Dentists, and three who are unaffiliated. Five patient representatives have an advisory role but no vote. Representatives of patient organizations have the right to participate in different decision-making bodies—for example, the subcommittees of the Federal Joint Committee.“The Federal Association of Sickness Funds works with the Federal Association of SHI Physicians and the German Hospital Federation to develop the SHI ambulatory care fee schedule and the DRG catalogue, which are then adopted by bilateral joint committees.”\nSource: Commonwealth Fund.

All provide the same services as defined by the G-BA (Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss) or the different umbrella organizations of the SHFs (referred to in the following the Statutory Health Insurer’s organizations (SHIs). Private insurance covers nearly the same services but allows additional benefits (e.g. first class service) – there is competition between private insurers. Since 2004, decision-making in statutory health insurance has been integrated into a trans-sector federal joint committee that is supported by an independent institute for quality and efficiency in health care, the German IQWiG.

Anyone who earns more than that can choose to have private insurance (“private Krankenversicherung” – PKV).“Funding through insurance premiums: Health care is financed mostly from the premiums paid by insured employees and their employers. Tax revenue surpluses also contribute. To give you an idea of what this means: State-funded health care systems like those in Great Britain or Sweden draw on tax revenue. In market-oriented systems such as that in the United States, many people have to carry the costs of treatment and loss of earnings due to illness themselves, or have to get private health insurance.“Principle of solidarity: In the German health care system, statutory health insurance members jointly carry the individual risks of the costs of medical care in the event of illness. Everyone covered by statutory insurance has an equal right to medical care and continued payment of wages when ill – regardless of their income and premium level. The premiums are based on income. This means that the rich can help the poor, and the healthy can help the ill. However, these premiums are only calculated based on a percentage scale up to a certain income level (“Beitragsbemessungsgrenze”). Anyone earning more than this amount pays the same maximum premium.“Principle of self-governance: While the German state sets the conditions for medical care, the further organization and financing of individual medical services is the responsibility of the self-governing bodies within the health care system. These are made up of members representing doctors and dentists, psychotherapists, hospitals, insurers and the insured people. The Federal Joint Committee (“Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss” or G-BA – please also see below: “Structure and institutions of the health care system”) is the highest entity of self-governance within the statutory health insurance system.” \nSource:  InformedHealth.org [Internet].

At EUR 1,221 per capita for outpatient care and EUR 1,212 for inpatient care in 2019, these figures are above the EU averages (EUR 1,022 for outpatient and EUR 1,010 for inpatient care), as was Germany’s spending across all categories of health care (Figure 8). However, overall spending has increased more slowly than the EU average since 2016, and the distribution of resources across different functions is close to the EU averages at around 27 % each for inpatient and outpatient care (EU: 29.1 % and 29.5 %), 19 % for long-term care (LTC) (EU: 16 %), 19 % for medical goods (EU: 18 %) and 3 % for prevention (EU: 3 %). Over recent years, LTC spending has grown more strongly than other expenditure categories. In 2015, Germany spent EUR 637 per capita on LTC (the health component); this increased to EUR 849 in 2019. The 2017 reform of LTC increased spending as it expanded the benefits package and increased the number of recipients entitled to LTC services.”\nSource: OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies (2021), Germany: Country Health Profile 2021, State of Health in the EU, OECD Publishing, Paris/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, Brussels.\n“Germany spends a substantial amount of its wealth on health. Total expenditure on health amounted to 11.7% of GDP in 2018 according to data of the Federal Statistical Office. According to WHO data, per capita health expenditure more than doubled between 2000 and 2018, from US$ 2687 (adjusted for differences in purchasing power) to US$ 6098, which ranks Germany third in comparison to other WHO Europe countries in 2018 (after Switzerland and Norway) (World Health Organization Regional Office for Europe, 2020) (see Section 3.1 Health expenditure). By OECD data, health expenditure in Germany as a share of GDP was the fourth highest share among OECD countries (after the United States, Switzerland and Norway) and per capita spending was way above the OECD36 average of US$ 3994 in 2018 (OECD, 2019).“Per capita expenditure on health in Germany rose by an average of 2.5% per annum in real terms between 2013 and 2018 (up from 2.1% p.a. between 2008 and 2013). In comparison to other OECD countries, this was a relatively large increase during this period, and higher than in the Netherlands (0.5%), France (0.8%), Austria (1.0%), Switzerland (2.1%) and the OECD36 average (2.4%). According to OECD calculations, average per capita health expenditure growth is projected at 1.9% a year between 2015 and 2030, which would reflect a moderate increase compared to other OECD countries (OECD, 2019). The pace of health expenditure growth is partly attributable to the comparatively large human, technical and infrastructural resources in the German health care system and a high level of activity (e.g. in terms of consultations, hospital cases, consumption of pharmaceuticals). In addition, the full implementation of reforms to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) scheme, such as the broadening of eligibility criteria and benefits, and a rapidly ageing population, represent additional pressures on the sustainability of financing (see Section 5.8 Long-term care).”\nSource: Blümel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i–273.\n“Cost-sharing and out-of-pocket spending: Out-of-pocket spending accounted for 13.2 percent of total health spending in 2014, mostly on nursing homes, pharmaceuticals, and medical aids.9“Copayments include EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 (USD6.36 to USD12.72) per outpatient prescription, EUR10.00 per inpatient day for hospital and rehabilitation stays (for the first 28 days per year), and EUR5.00 to EUR10.00 for prescribed medical devices. Sickness funds offer selectable tariffs with a range of deductibles and no-claims bonuses. Preventive services do not count toward the deductible. SHI-contracted physicians are not allowed to charge above the fee schedule for services in the SHI benefit catalogue. However, a list of “individual health services” outside the comprehensive range of SHI coverage may be offered to patients paying out of pocket.“Safety nets: Children under 18 years of age are exempt from cost-sharing. For adults, there is an annual cap on cost-sharing equal to 2 percent of household income; part of a household’s income is excluded from this calculation for additional family members. About 0.3 million of those insured under SHI exceeded the 2 percent cap in 2014 and were exempted from further cost-sharing. The cap is lowered to 1 percent of annual gross income for qualifying chronically ill people; to qualify, those people have to demonstrate that they attended recommended counseling or screening procedures prior to becoming ill. Nearly 6.3 million people, or around 9 percent of all the SHI-insured, benefited from this regulation in 2014.10 Unemployed people contribute to SHI in proportion to their unemployment entitlements. For the long-term unemployed, government contributes on their behalf.” \nSource: Commonwealth Fund. International Health System Profiles: Germany. From the web, last accessed Sept. 30, 2019.\n“Allocative efficiency indicates the extent to which an appropriate mix of services or interventions are purchased to maximize population health outcomes. In Germany the allocation of resources at the federal level mostly reflects the bargaining process between corporatist bodies, rather than a restrictive budget plan. Although there are mechanisms in place to secure the (cost-)effectiveness of benefits covered under SHI using tools such as Health Technology Assessment (see Section 2.7 Regulation), there is no priority setting by e.g. formulating goals. Pooled resources are reallocated among the sickness funds according to a morbidity-based risk-adjustment scheme, by which sickness funds have to cover all costs (see Section 3.3 Overview of the statutory financing system). However, the details of care provision and reimbursement are consequently negotiated between corporatist bodies and are not guided by an overarching strategic programme at the national level (instead, budgets are determined by historic spending levels).“International comparisons of health expenditure by function show that Germany spent 27.2% on curative and rehabilitative care in inpatient and day care settings in 2018, which is higher than in the Netherlands (24.4%), Denmark (25.1%) and Switzerland (25.3%), but lower than the EU average (30%), France (31.5%) and Austria (33.3%) (OECD, 2020b). In more detail, Germany spent € 1169 per inhabitant on hospital care in 2018 (up from € 691 in 2000), € 428 on inpatient long-term care (up from € 211 in 2000) and € 122 on preventive and rehabilitative institutions (up from € 92 in 2000).“Germany spent considerably less on ambulatory care than other EU countries. For instance, France (27.2%), Austria (29%), the Netherlands (29.2%), Switzerland (33.4%) and Denmark (34.9%) spent a higher share of health expenditure on ambulatory care, and the EU average is 31.4% (OECD, 2020b). In 2018, € 662 was spent per inhabitant for ambulatory care practices (up from € 383 in 2000), € 330 for dental care practices (up from € 227), € 257 for ambulatory long-term care (up from € 83) and € 206 on other allied health professionals (up from € 73).“Pharmaceuticals and medical devices accounted for another 13.7% of current health expenditures in 2018 (the fourth highest), according to the Federal Statistical Office. OECD data give a higher estimation for this category, with pharmaceuticals and medical devices representing the third highest budget item (19.3%). Under this data source, comparative countries like France (18.4%), Austria (168%), Switzerland (14.8%) and the Netherlands (11.5%) spent less on pharmaceuticals than Germany, while Denmark (10%) recorded almost half of the German costs (OECD, 2020b).”\nSource: Blümel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R. Germany: Health system review. Health Systems in Transition, 2020; 22(6): pp.i–273.\n“A large part of health care expenditure in Germany is derived from the SHI [Statutory Health Insurance] system (see Table 3.2). Contributions to the 105 sickness funds constitute the major system of financing health care. The sickness funds are responsible for collecting contributions, which they transfer to a central reallocation pool known as the Gesundheitsfonds, which is responsible for pooling and reallocating the revenues according to a risk-adjustment mechanism (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds).“General tax revenue is also used for various purposes in the health care system. All tax-based budgets, at federal as well as state level, are determined by legislatures acting on proposals from their governments. In addition, the Hospital Financing Act stipulates that investment costs should be paid from state taxes as well as by owners of public, private not-for-profit and private for-profit hospitals, if listed in the state’s hospital requirement plan. Therefore, states receive tax money for investments in their hospitals (see Section 3.7.1 Paying for health services).“Taxes as a source of health care financing have decreased throughout the last decade, falling from 10.8% of total health expenditure in 1996 to 4.2% in 2018. The most substantial decrease has been observed in spending on long-term care (about 50%), reflecting the unburdening of municipal budgets after the introduction of statutory long-term care insurance (see Section 5.8 Long-term care). Nevertheless, other spending on investments has decreased as well. Altogether, general government and statutory public sources accounted for 73.5% of current expenditure on health. Private sources accounted for a total 26.5% of total current expenditure: this includes direct out-of-pocket payments made by private households (13.6%). Private insurers financed 8.7%, which includes expenditures for substitutive/comprehensive health insurance, complementary health insurance and long-term care insurance.“It should be noted that the largest tax-financed item – the subsidies for SHI – is not declared as such in the fiscal statistics. Sickness funds receive a fixed amount from the federal budget for several benefits relevant to family policies: maternity benefits, sick-pay for parents caring for sick children, in-vitro fertilization, sterilization for contraceptive purposes, and prescription-only contraception up to the age of 21 and legal abortions. The federal government transfers its subsidy to the central reallocation pool (see Section 3.3.3 Pooling and allocation of funds). In 2012 the federal subsidy was € 14 billion. In order to consolidate the federal budget, the subsidy was temporarily reduced to € 10.5 billion in 2013 and € 11.5 billion in 2015. In 2016 it was again at € 14 billion and from 2017 it has been set at € 14.5 billion annually (Bundesministerium für Gesundheit (BMG), 2020j). Although these funds come from general taxation, these sums are coded as “statutory health insurance” in health expenditure statistics.* Figure 3.4 shows the main financial flows between the population, purchasers and health care providers in the German health care system in 2018 – including public health services and long-term care (except the purchasers and providers mentioned in the footnote).”\nSource: Blümel M, Spranger A, Achstetter K, Maresso A, Busse R.

Revenues and outlays alike increased from 2023 totals: Revenues rose by 11 percent, or $479 billion, and outlays increased by 10 percent, or $617 billion. Revenues in all major categories, but notably individual income taxes, were greater than they were in fiscal year 2023. The largest increase in outlays was for education ($309 billion). Net outlays for interest on the public debt rose by $239\xa0billion (or 34 percent) to a total of $949 billion. Those amounts differ only slightly from the amounts CBO estimated and discussed in last month’s Monthly Budget Review.\nTable 1.Totals, Fiscal Years 2019 to 2024Billions of Dollars\xa0201920202021202220232024Receipts3,463\xa03,421\xa04,047\xa04,897\xa04,439\xa04,919\xa0Outlays4,447\xa06,554\xa06,822\xa06,273\xa06,135\xa06,752\xa0Deficit (−)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Amount−984\xa0−3,132\xa0−2,775\xa0−1,376\xa0−1,695\xa0−1,833\xa0\xa0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product−4.6\xa0−14.7\xa0−12.1\xa0−5.4\xa0−6.2\xa0−6.4\xa0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.\xa0\nIn 2024, the deficit was equal to 6.4 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), an increase from 6.2 percent of GDP in 2023. The 2024 deficit as a share of GDP is greater than the 50‑year average of 3.8 percent and has been exceeded only six times since 1946 (from 2009 through 2012 and in 2020 and 2021). Compared with the size of the economy, federal debt held by the public also increased in 2024—rising to 97.8 percent of GDP from 96.0 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays in fiscal years 2023 and 2024 were affected because October 1 (the first day of the fiscal year) fell on a weekend in each of those years. As a result, certain payments were shifted into the prior fiscal year—$64 billion from 2023 into 2022 and $75 billion from 2024 into 2023. If not for those shifts, the deficit in 2024 would have been 13 percent larger—instead of 8 percent larger—than it was in 2023.\nThe 2023 deficit of $1.7 trillion would have been larger if not for the recording of budgetary effects related to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn a plan the Administration announced in 2022 to cancel many borrowers’ outstanding student loans.1 If those effects, and the effects of timing shifts, were excluded for fiscal year 2023, the deficit for that year would have been $2.0\xa0trillion instead of $1.7 trillion. Thus, without the savings related to the unwinding of the proposed debt cancellation (and excluding the effects of timing shifts in 2023 and 2024), CBO estimates that the\xa0federal deficit would have been $106 billion smaller in 2024 than in 2023.\nThe deficit in 2024 was $82 billion (or 4 percent), smaller than the shortfall estimated in CBO’s most recent baseline budgetary projections, which were issued in June 2024.2 Revenues were greater than CBO projected in that baseline—by $29 billion (or 1\xa0percent) and outlays were less than projected, by $53 billion (or 1 percent).\nTotal Receipts: Up by 11 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nReceipts totaled $4.9 trillion during fiscal year 2024, CBO estimates—$479 billion more than during fiscal year 2023. Receipts increased from 16.2 percent of GDP in 2023 to 17.1 percent in 2024, just below the average of 17.3 percent for the past 50 years. A portion of that increase is the result of the postponement until fiscal year 2024 of various 2023 tax deadlines for some taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas.\n\nReported receipts from individual income taxes, the largest source of revenue, increased by $250 billion (or 11 percent). Such collections increased from 8.0\xa0percent of GDP in 2023 to 8.4 percent in 2024, remaining close to the average of 8.0 percent over the past 50 years.\nIndividual income taxes withheld from workers’ paychecks increased by $72 billion (or\xa04\xa0percent), reflecting increases in wages and salaries.\nNonwithheld income tax payments increased by $104 billion (or 12\xa0percent), relative to payments in the same period in fiscal year 2023. That increase includes the effects of delayed payments from taxpayers in areas affected by natural disasters for whom, beginning in February 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) postponed some 2023 filing deadlines. Most of those payments were due by November 2023.\nThe increase in nonwithheld income tax payments would have been even larger were it not for an adjustment of $8.5 billion in fuel tax refunds and credits that were recorded originally in fiscal year 2023. In that year, the IRS reported payments of fuel tax refunds and credits that were not actually paid, incorrectly reducing amounts reported for excise tax collections and increasing amounts reported for collections of individual income taxes. A recertification of the fuel tax credit in July\xa02024 resulted in an increase in the reported amounts of excise tax collections for that year and a reduction in the amount recorded for collections of individual income taxes. As\xa0a result, the year-over-year change in individual income taxes was reduced by $17\xa0billion.\nIndividual income tax refunds declined by $74 billion (or 20 percent), in part because of\xa0a moratorium placed on new claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit, which increased individual income tax refunds in\xa02023. The IRS announced the moratorium in September 2023. In August 2024, the IRS began processing claims while continuing efforts to identify improper and ineligible claims.\n\n\n\nTable 2.Total ReceiptsBillions of DollarsMajor SourceFY\xa02022FY\xa02023FY\xa02024Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Individual Income Taxes2,632\xa02,176\xa02,426\xa011.5\xa0Payroll Taxes1,484\xa01,614\xa01,710\xa05.9\xa0Corporate Income Taxes425\xa0420\xa0530\xa026.3\xa0Other Receipts357\xa0229\xa0253\xa010.7\xa0\xa0\xa0Total4,897\xa04,439\xa04,919\xa010.8\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product19.2\xa016.2\xa017.1\xa0n.a.\xa0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and BudgetFY = fiscal year; n.a. = not applicable.\xa0\n\nReceipts recorded from payroll (social insurance) taxes, the second-largest revenue source,\xa0rose by $95 billion (or 6 percent), remaining at 5.9\xa0percent of GDP and close to the 6.0\xa0percent average for the past 50 years. Payroll tax collections typically rise or fall with rising or falling wages and salaries, which constitute the largest part of the payroll tax base. Unemployment insurance receipts (one type of payroll tax) declined by $1 billion (or\xa02\xa0percent).\nReceipts from corporate income taxes increased by $110 billion (or 26 percent), from 1.5\xa0percent of GDP in 2023 to 1.8 percent in 2024—equal to the average of the past 50 years. However, a significant part of that increase was caused by the IRS’s postponement until November 2023 of the deadline for payments that ordinarily would have been due in fiscal year 2023 for many corporations in areas affected by natural disasters, particularly in California.\nReported receipts from other sources rose, on net, by $24 billion (or 11 percent). Most of that increase is the result of the recertification of fuel tax refunds and credits; without that effect, receipts from other sources would have shown an increase of only 3 percent in 2024. Regardless of that timing effect, receipts from other sources remained below 1 percent of GDP and below the 50‑year average of 1.5 percent of GDP.\nExcise taxes in 2024 increased by $26 billion (or 34 percent), compared with 2023, largely as a result of the recertification of fuel tax credits.\nRemittances from the Federal Reserve increased by $3 billion, from less than $1 billion in 2023. Those amounts represented significantly less than 0.1 percent of GDP. Those amounts are well below the $107 billion remitted in 2022 and also well below the 50‑year average of 0.3 percent of GDP. Since 2022, higher short-term interest rates have raised the central bank’s interest expenses above its income, eliminating the profits of most of the Federal Reserve banks.\nMiscellaneous fees and fines increased by $2 billion (or 4 percent).\nCustoms duties declined by $3 billion (or 4 percent).\nEstate and gift taxes declined by $2 billion (or 6 percent).\n\n\n\nTotal Outlays: Up by 10 Percent in Fiscal Year 2024\nOutlays in fiscal year 2024 were $6.8 trillion—$617 billion (or 10\xa0percent) more than in 2023. In total, outlays were equal to 23.4 percent of GDP in 2024, down from the recent high of 30.7\xa0percent in 2020, but still above the 50-year average of 21.1 percent.\nTable 3.Total OutlaysBillions of Dollars\xa0\xa0Percentage ChangeFrom 2023 to 2024Major Program or CategoryFY\xa02022FY 2023FY 2024ActualAdjustedaSocial Security Benefits1,206\xa01,342\xa01,448\xa07.9\xa07.9\xa0Medicareb752\xa0844\xa0870\xa03.1\xa09.4\xa0Medicaid592\xa0616\xa0618\xa00.3\xa00.3\xa0\xa0Subtotal, Largest MandatorySpending Programs2,550\xa02,802\xa02,935\xa04.8\xa06.7\xa0\xa0Department of Education639\xa0−41\xa0268\xa0n.m.\xa0n.m.\xa0Veterans Affairs274\xa0301\xa0325\xa08.0\xa013.8\xa0Refundable Tax Creditsc292\xa0171\xa0199\xa016.2\xa016.2\xa0FDIC−9\xa092\xa037\xa0−59.5\xa0−59.5\xa0U.S Coronavirus Refundable Credits29\xa052\xa01\xa0−98.5\xa0−98.5\xa0PBGC2\xa040\xa012\xa0−70.2\xa0−70.2\xa0Food and Nutrition Service192\xa0171\xa0147\xa0−14.0\xa0−14.0\xa0DoD—Militaryd726\xa0776\xa0826\xa06.5\xa07.2\xa0Net Interest on the Public Debt534\xa0710\xa0949\xa033.7\xa033.7\xa0Other1,044\xa01,061\xa01,051\xa0−0.9\xa00.2\xa0\xa0\xa0Total6,273\xa06,135\xa06,752\xa010.1\xa011.5\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Percentage of Gross Domestic Product24.6\xa022.4\xa023.4\xa0n.a.\xa0n.a.\xa0Data sources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of the Treasury; Office of Management and Budget.DoD = Department of Defense; FDIC = Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; FY = fiscal year; PBGC = Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; n.a. = not applicable; n.m. = not meaningful.a. Adjusted amounts exclude the effects of shifting payments that otherwise would have been made on a weekend. If not for those timing shifts, total outlays would have been $6,123 billion in 2023 and $6,827 billion in 2024. (In 2022, total outlays excluding timing shifts would have been $6,209 billion.)b.

Because of those shifts, outlays were lower by $75 billion in 2024 and higher by a net of $11\xa0billion in 2023. If not for those shifts, the increase in outlays from 2023 to 2024 would have been larger—$703\xa0billion rather than $617 billion. (The discussion below reflects adjustments to exclude the effects of those timing shifts.)\nIf the 2024 savings related to the unwinding of the proposed cancellation of student loans (discussed below) and the effects of timing shifts are excluded, CBO estimates that outlays in 2024 would have been $373\xa0billion (or 6\xa0percent) greater than in 2023.\nOutlays by the Department of Education increased by $309 billion, largely because the Administration recorded a decrease of $330\xa0billion in August 2023 to reflect the June 2023 Supreme Court decision prohibiting the cancellation of outstanding loans for many borrowers. Excluding the reversal of that proposed debt cancellation, net outlays by the department decreased by $21 billion, primarily because increases in the estimated costs of outstanding loans recorded in fiscal year 2023 were larger than the increases recorded for those costs in 2024. Partly offsetting that decrease, the costs recorded for loans originated in 2024 were higher than the costs of loans originated in 2023. The totals do not include the costs of the debt cancellation policy described in a proposed rule published in April 2024; that rule is currently paused by litigation.\nThe next-largest increase in outlays was for net interest on the public debt. Those outlays rose substantially—increasing by $239\xa0billion (or\xa034\xa0percent)—primarily because interest rates were significantly higher in fiscal year 2024 than they were in fiscal year 2023.\nOutlays for the largest mandatory spending programs increased by $186 billion (or\xa07\xa0percent):\n\nSpending for Social Security benefits rose by $106 billion (or 8 percent) because of increases in the average benefit payment (stemming mostly from cost-of-living adjustments) and in the number of beneficiaries.\nMedicare outlays increased, on net, by $78 billion (or 9 percent) because of increased enrollment and higher payment rates for services.\nMedicaid outlays increased by $2 billion (or less than 1 percent) because states have largely completed reassessing the eligibility of enrollees who remained in the program for the duration of the coronavirus public health emergency. (The continuous-enrollment requirement ended on March 31, 2023.) Despite millions of disenrollments during the period in which states reassessed eligibility, Medicaid outlays rose in 2024 because per-person costs for enrollees remaining on Medicaid were greater in 2024 than they were in 2023.\n\nOutlays increased in several other areas:\n\nSpending by the Department of Defense was $56 billion (or 7 percent) greater than in fiscal year 2023; the largest increases were for research and development and operation and maintenance.\nSpending by the Department of Veterans Affairs increased by $41 billion (or 14 percent), mostly because of increased spending per person and veterans’ increased use of health care facilities.\nOutlays for certain refundable tax credits increased by $28 billion (or 16\xa0percent).3 Those outlays include subsidies for health insurance purchased through the marketplaces established under the Affordable Care Act, which were boosted by higher enrollments.\nNet outlays by the Department of Energy (included in “Other” in Table 3) increased by $15\xa0billion (or 43 percent), primarily because in fiscal year 2023 the Administration sold a substantial amount of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. No such receipts were recorded in 2024. From October 2023 through May 2024, the Administration spent $1 billion to purchase oil to replenish the reserve.\n\nOutlays declined in several areas:\n\nOutlays of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) decreased by $55 billion (or\xa060\xa0percent). Outlays in fiscal year 2023 were $92 billion as the FDIC began to resolve two major bank failures that occurred in March 2023. The FDIC’s outlays totaled $37 billion during fiscal year 2024 while that agency continued to resolve those failures along with four more that occurred after March 2023. Starting in June 2024, the FDIC began charging special assessments to recover the losses that resulted from covering uninsured depositors at two of the failed institutions. Over the next decade, the FDIC expects to continue to recover much of the amounts spent by liquidating the failed banks’ assets and by collecting higher premiums from FDIC-insured institutions.\nOutlays related to U.S. Coronavirus Refundable Credits, a group of temporary tax credits to help employers cover the costs of sick and family leave, employee retention, and continuation of health insurance for certain workers, decreased by $51 billion (or 98\xa0percent). That result is attributable in part to the IRS’s moratorium on processing claims for the Employee Retention Tax Credit.\nNet spending by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation decreased by $28\xa0billion (or\xa070\xa0percent) primarily because of a decline in onetime payments to certain multiemployer pension plans under the Special Financial Assistance Program. Such payments amounted to $15\xa0billion in fiscal year 2024, compared with $46 billion during 2023.\nSpending by the Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service decreased by $24\xa0billion (or 14 percent), in part because emergency allotments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ended in March 2023.\nOutlays from the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund (also in “Other”) declined by $14 billion (or 50 percent), as expenditures decreased for pandemic-related activities.\n\nEstimated Deficit in October 2024: $255 Billion\nThe federal government incurred a deficit of $255 billion in October 2024, CBO estimates—$189\xa0billion more than the shortfall recorded last October. Revenues were lower this October (the first month of fiscal year 2025) than a year ago and outlays were higher.\nRevenues in October 2024 were $77 billion less than they were last October, when individual and corporate income taxes had been boosted by deferred payments. Outlays in October 2023 were affected by shifts in the timing of certain federal payments that otherwise would have been due on October 1, which fell on a weekend (those payments were made in September 2023, the last month of fiscal year 2023). If not for those shifts, the increase in outlays in October compared with the same month last year would have been smaller—$39 billion rather than $112 billion. Correspondingly, the increase in the deficit for October also would have been smaller—$116\xa0billion rather than $189 billion.\nActual Surplus in September 2024: $64 Billion\nThe Treasury Department reported a surplus of $64\xa0billion for September—$1 billion more than CBO estimated last month, on the basis of the Daily Treasury Statements, in the Monthly Budget Review: September 2024.\nEach month, CBO issues an analysis of federal spending and revenues for the previous month and the fiscal year to date.

"[""Signal Timing\n\xa0\nWhy Correct Signal Timing is so Important\n(Read the Full Report)\nAt signalized intersections, the period between conflicting green phases is known as the change interval.\xa0 It is composed of a yellow signal phase plus an optional all-red interval.\xa0 The purpose of the yellow phase is to alert drivers that their right-of-way is about to end and, depending upon their relative proximity to the intersection, to permit them to come to a safe stop or allow them time to clear the limit line prior to the onset of the red phase. The purpose of the all-red interval is to allow vehicles which have lega1ly entered the intersection prior to the onset of the red signal to clear any potential points of conflict before the release of opposing vehicles or pedestrians.\nTransportation officials and engineers know that the proper timing of the change interval is essential to intersection safety.\xa0 If the yellow signal phase is too short, a “dilemma zone” is created.\xa0 Motorists who are unfortunate enough to be within this section of the roadway when the yellow signal illuminates may neither be able to stop safely nor legally enter the intersection before the onset of the red phase.\xa0 Dilemma zones virtually assure that some percentage of drivers will be forced to brake suddenly or violate the red, thereby creating the potential for rear end collisions or vehicle conflicts within the intersection.\xa0 If the all-red interval is insufficient, vehicles from the previous green phase may not have completely cleared the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\xa0 Again, this generates the potential for vehicle conflicts including highly dangerous broadside collisions within the intersection.\nWhen both the yellow and all-red phases are too short, a significant safety hazard is created.\xa0 Some drivers will be forced to violate the red due to the too-short yellow and cross traffic will be released before they completely clear the intersection. Intersections which exhibit a higher than average number of red-light related collisions most likely have either a yellow phase or all-red phase which is too short.\xa0 Often times, both problems exist at the same intersection.\xa0 Correcting the signal timing will most likely eliminate the vast majority of collisions at these locations.\nHow the Yellow Phase is Determined\nA mathematical formula established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is used to calculate the minimum safe time for the yellow signal and is primarily based on the speed of the traffic approaching the intersection and the reaction time of the average driver.\nThe ITE specifies the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic be used as the approach speed to ensure that the yellow phase provides sufficient stopping time for at least 85% of the vehicles approaching the intersection.\xa0 California law requires the use of the 85th percentile speed or the posted speed limit.\xa0 However, if the posted speed limit is used and the 85th percentile speed is substantially greater, then the yellow phase will be under-timed and a safety hazard will exist as a significant number of drivers will encounter a dilemma zone.\xa0 For example, if the yellow signal is timed for 35 mph, the yellow light will be set at 3.6 seconds, but if the 85th percentile speed of traffic is 45 mph the yellow signal should be 4.3 seconds, too short by almost 1 full second.\xa0 While this difference may not seem like much, it will often make the difference between whether or not a violation occurs.\nDriver perception-reaction time, is the time between the onset of the yellow phase and when the vehicle’s brakes engage.\xa0 During this time, the driver must see the light change from green to yellow, perceive the meaning of the change, decide whether they are able to safely stop or if they should continue through the intersection, and if they decide to stop, move their foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes. The ITE suggests that a value of 1 second be used for this variable.\xa0 However, a number of studies suggest that this figure may not adequately account for driver perception-reaction times, especially in an urban environment such as Los Angeles due to “cognitive overload” where the reaction time may actually be closer to 1.5 seconds.\nMaximizing Safety through Longer Yellow Timing\nSafety dictates that the yellow signal time be calculated using the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic approaching the intersection based on a current traffic survey.\xa0 When a survey is unavailable, the 85th percentile speed should be assumed to be at least 10 mph above the posted speed limit.\xa0 Likewise, in the interest of safety, driver reaction time should be assumed to be at least 1.4 seconds.\xa0 Together, this change would likely increase the yellow time at many intersections by about 1 second and significantly improve safety.\nThe safety benefit of longer yellow signal times has been proven in a number of studies.\xa0 A Texas DOT study found that when the yellow interval is set one second longer than the minimum time, violations decreased by 53% and crashes decreased by 40%.\nThe chart below shows a similar 30% to 55% reduction in violations achieved at San Diego red-light camera sites when the yellow interval times were increased.\n\nLikewise, the following two figures show how Fairfax County, VA achieved a significant, sustained reduction in violations when the yellow timing was increased\nby ½ second.\xa0 Note also that red-light cameras were present during the entire review period, but a dramatic reduction in violations was seen only after the yellow timing was increased.\n\n\nAs for concerns that drivers will modify their behavior to account for the longer yellow light and still run the red, the data shows that such an adjustment does not happen provided the yellow time does not exceed about 5.5 seconds.\nHow the All-Red Clearance Phase is Determined\nThe ITE uses another formula to calculate the appropriate all-red phase which takes into consideration the width of the intersection and the speed of traffic. In contrast to the formula for the yellow signal timing this formula uses the speed of the slowest 15% of drivers to ensure that these vehicles have sufficient time to clear the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\xa0 Generally the 15th percentile speed can be assumed to be 5 – 10 mph below the posted speed limit.\nMaximizing Safety through a Longer All-Red Phase\nAs discussed previously, the purpose of the all-red phase is to allow vehicles that enter the intersection in the last moments of the yellow phase to clear the intersection prior to release of cross traffic or pedestrians.\xa0 Wider intersections necessarily require longer all-red phases.\xa0 A vehicle traveling at 35 mph will require just over 2 seconds to clear an intersection 90 feet wide and 2.83 seconds to completely clear an intersection 125 feet wide.\xa0 Slower vehicles would require more time to clear those intersections.\xa0 These clearance intervals provide a sufficient all-red phase to clear any vehicles that cross the limit line just as the signal changes from yellow to red.\xa0 However, in real world situations, some drivers will enter the intersection just after the signal turns to red.\xa0 This is often due to yellow times that are too short, drivers who simply miscalculate the time it will take them to reach the limit line before the yellow phase ends, or drivers who hesitate or slow momentarily before deciding they have sufficient time to make it into the intersection before the red illuminates.\xa0\xa0 The 2004 Texas DOT study determined that when a red light violation occurs, about 60 percent of the time it occurs within the first half second of the red phase.\xa0 The distribution of red light violations as a function of time-into-red appears in the figure below.\n\nIn order to minimize the chance that collisions will occur at signalized intersections, the all-red clearance interval must be long enough to allow all vehicles to clear the intersection before cross traffic is released.\xa0 This interval should be extended slightly to account for vehicles that enter the intersection just after the red phase begins.\xa0 For example, a vehicle traveling at 35 mph would require approximately 2 seconds to clear an 80 foot wide intersection.\xa0 However, if the driver miscalculates or hesitates and enters the intersection ½ second after the light turns red, his vehicle will not completely clear the intersection until 2.5 seconds after the red phase begins.\xa0 In this situation, the 2 second all-red clearance interval dictated by the ITE formula would not be sufficient to prevent a possible vehicle conflict within the intersection.\xa0 While it may not be desirable to increase the all-red phase to account for every vehicle that might enter the intersection after the red phase begins, extending the all-red phase ½ second beyond the time calculated using the ITE formula would prevent collisions that might be caused by the 60% of violations that occur immediately after the onset of red.\xa0 This could add an additional measure of safety without unduly reducing traffic flow.\nExisting Conditions at Los Angeles Intersections\nAs part of an ongoing study of traffic safety in Los Angeles, Safer Streets L.A. identified intersections within the city with a higher than average number of red-light related collisions.\xa0 Without exception, we found that either the yellow time, the all-red phase or both are currently below the ITE minimums based on the actual speed of traffic at these locations and therefore insufficient to provide the margin of safety necessary to protect the motoring public.\xa0 In some cases the yellow signal time is 1 full second too short and the all-red phase is a much as 2 seconds too short.\nUnquestionably, at intersections where red-light related accidents are over represented, an engineering deficiency exists.\xa0 As explained above, drivers in an urban environment such as L.A. may need additional reaction time to respond to the yellow signal and routinely travel at 10 mph or more beyond the posted speed limit.\xa0 Therefore, it would be prudent to extend the yellow signal time at least 1 second and extend the all-red clearance interval at least 0.5 seconds beyond the ITE minimums.\xa0 Additional engineering improvements may be necessary at some intersections to be determined based on a comprehensive engineering survey.\nThe City of Los Angeles now has an economical option available that would achieve a greater safety benefit than the proposed multi-million dollar red-light camera program.\xa0 The cost to change signal timing is insignificant.\xa0 The City can swiftly achieve a reduction in accidents as well as violations at numerous signalized intersections simply by extending the yellow and all-red signal phases.\xa0 There is no reason not to immediately implement these strategies at problem intersections.\xa0 Failure to do so not only puts the motoring public at risk, it leaves the City open to the possibility of litigation should injuries or fatalities occur due to deficient signal timing.\n(Read the Full

fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.—While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n“It’s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,” said\xa0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. “Excluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n“On the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.”\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\xa0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience.

Power\nTroy, Mich.—While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n“It’s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,” said\xa0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. “Excluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n“On the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.”\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\xa0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience.

This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \nâ\x80\x8dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, ""backorder"" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller\'s inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer\'s order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo\'s arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrierâ\x80\x99s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer\'s destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller\'s obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term ""Consignee"" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer\'s (consignee\'s) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead \'rolled over\' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer\'s country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer\'s specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer\'s country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller\'s obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer\'s country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\nâ\x80\x8dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship\'s carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier\'s equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA shipâ\x80\x99s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesnâ\x80\x99t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the sellerâ\x80\x99s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment ""size/type"" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20\'/40\'/45\' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer\'s vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller\'s obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA ""Flag of Convenience"" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship\'s owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the ownerâ\x80\x99s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).Â\xa0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world\'s largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.Â\xa0\nAmong large ports (4-10MÂ\xa0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazilâ\x80\x99s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.Â\xa0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.Â\xa0\n\xa0Port\n\xa0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\xa0Change vs. August (days)\n\xa0Santos (Brazil)\n\xa02.5\n\xa0 +0.5\n\xa0Manila (Philippines)\n\xa02.2\n\xa0-0.1\n\xa0Savannah (USA)\n\xa01.1\n\xa0-0.1\n\xa0Piraeus (Greece)\n\xa00.8\n\xa0NC\n\xa0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\xa00.5\n\xa0+0.4\n\xa0Port\n\xa0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\xa0Change vs. August (days)\n\xa0Durban (South Africa)\n\xa02.8\n\xa0 +0.3\n\xa0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\xa01.9\n\xa0-2.0\n\xa0Vancouver (Canada)\n\xa01.7\n\xa0+1.1\n\xa0Lomé (Togo)\n\xa00.9\n\xa0-0.2\n\xa0Tema (Ghana)\n\xa00.9\n\xa0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.Â\xa0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots.

No single factor gives a complete picture of port congestion, but taken collectively these metrics can provide insight into how ports around the world are able to cope with supply chain pressures. â\x80\x8d\nAnchor times provide insight into harbor congestion by measuring how long vessels are waiting, on average, before they are able to berth at a port. \nâ\x80\x8dBerth times provide insight into the time it takes for vessels to be unloaded and loaded. While larger ports typically have longer berth times due to handling larger vessels, looking at changes in berth times month over month can give insight into ports that may be dealing with operational issues. \nWhile the first two factors look at the time it takes for vessels to move through the port, container dwell times give insight into how well ports are facilitating the movement of goods out of the yard and onwards to their final destinations. \nContinue reading\nIn Numbers: The Impact of the Red Sea Crisis on European & Asian Port Congestion\nWebinar Recap: Enhancing Supply Chain Collaboration Through Visibility\nThe Busiest Container Ports in the World\nSubscribe for the latest in supply chain technology.\n']","If the number of accesses to the traffic prediction study article in October 2024 increased by the average container dwell time at Long Beach port in September 2024, and then decreased by the month number of the publication date of the article, what would be the final number of accesses?","def solve():

This classification helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items.\nAn Advanced Shipping Notice (ASN), sometimes referred to as Advance Ship Notice, is a notification sent by a supplier or manufacturer to a customer or retailer to provide detailed information about a pending shipment. The ASN serves as an electronic document that outlines the contents of the shipment before it physically arrives at the destination. \nAn agile supply chain is a flexible and responsive approach to supply chain management that enables organizations to quickly adapt to changing market conditions, customer demands, and disruptions. It focuses on enhancing speed, efficiency, and adaptability throughout the entire supply chain process, from sourcing raw materials to delivering finished products to customers.\nAn air waybill (AWB) is a vital logistics document used in air freight transportation. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper (consignor) and the airline (carrier), detailing the terms and conditions of air transportation for the shipment. The air waybill contains essential information such as the origin and destination of the cargo, the description of goods, the weight, and the freight charges.\nAn arrival notice is a notification sent by a carrier or freight forwarder to inform consignees or recipients that a shipment has arrived at its destination port or facility. This notice serves as an important communication tool in the supply chain, providing recipients with essential information about the arrival of their goods and detailing the next steps for delivery or pickup.\nAn Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a tracking system used in the maritime industry to monitor the location and movement of ships. AIS provides real-time information about vessel identification, position, course, and speed. \nâ\x80\x8dBackhauling is a transportation logistics practice where trucks carry a return load on their way back from delivering goods to their destination. Instead of returning empty, trucks utilize their empty space to transport goods from the destination back to the point of origin or another destination along the route. \nIn supply chain management, ""backorder"" refers to a situation where a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily unavailable in the seller\'s inventory. When an item is on backorder, it means the customer\'s order cannot be fulfilled immediately due to insufficient stock levels.\n\nA bay plan is a diagram that details the stowage of containers on a vessel, specifying their exact position by bay, row, and tier to ensure efficient and safe loading and unloading operations.\nA Beneficial Cargo Owner (BCO) is the entity with ownership or a beneficial interest in transported goods. While not always the shipper, the BCO reaps the benefits of the cargo\'s arrival. \nA bill of lading (B/L) is a legal document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract between the shipper (seller) and the carrier (transport provider), detailing the terms and conditions of transportation, including the type, quantity, and destination of the goods.\nBlank sailing is a term used to describe the situation when a shipping line cancels a scheduled port call or an entire voyage. This can happen for various reasons, such as low demand for shipping services, operational issues, or unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or port congestion.\nA blind shipment refers to a logistics practice where certain details about the shipment, such as the sender, receiver, or contents, are intentionally obscured or withheld from one or both parties involved in the transaction. This is typically done to maintain confidentiality or to prevent competitors from obtaining sensitive information about suppliers, customers, or pricing.\nA bonded warehouse is a secured facility authorized by customs authorities where imported goods can be stored, manipulated, or undergo manufacturing operations without payment of duty.\nA booking confirmation is a document that verifies the reservation of space for cargo on a carrierâ\x80\x99s vessel, flight, or truck, ensuring all shipping arrangements are approved and scheduled.\nA request for reservation of space and equipment for a particular vessel/voyage and possibly inland transport.\nBreak bulk cargo refers to goods that are individually packaged or bundled, rather than being transported in containers or in bulk. These items are often large or irregular in size and include products like machinery, vehicles, construction materials, or heavy equipment. \nBuffer stock, also known as inventory buffer or stock buffer, refers to the extra inventory held by a company to mitigate the risk of stockouts caused by uncertainties in supply and demand. It acts as a cushion against fluctuations in customer demand, supply chain disruptions, and variations in lead times.\nBulk cargo refers to commodities that are transported unpackaged in large quantities, typically stored and handled in bulk form, rather than in individual units or containers. This category of cargo is crucial in global trade, especially for goods that are homogeneous and not easily damaged during transportation.\nThe bullwhip effect, also known as demand amplification or whiplash effect, is a phenomenon that occurs in supply chains where small fluctuations in demand at the consumer level lead to exaggerated fluctuations in demand further upstream in the supply chain. This amplification of demand variability causes inefficiencies, such as excess inventory, stockouts, and increased costs, as supply chain partners overreact to perceived demand changes.\nCIF, or Cost, Insurance, and Freight, is an international shipping agreement used in the transportation of goods. In freight shipping, CIF means that the seller takes responsibility for the cost of transporting goods to the buyer\'s destination port. This includes paying for shipping, handling, and insurance. The seller\'s obligations end when the goods reach the destination port, at which point the buyer assumes responsibility for customs clearance, import duties, and any further transport to their final destination.\nA Capesize ship is a large bulk carrier vessel designed to transport heavy raw materials across long distances, too large to transit through canals like the Panama or Suez.\nThe action of allowing cargo to leave the container yard typically authorized by the carrier. This is often confused with gate-out, but cargo release is the authorization necessary before shipments can be allowed to gate-out.\nA cargo survey is an inspection process that assesses the condition and quantity of goods during transportation to ensure compliance with shipping terms and prevent disputes.\nA shipping carrier is an organization that provides transportation services for goods. They manage the logistics of moving cargo, which includes loading, transporting, and delivering goods to the specified location. Shipping carriers handle various types of shipments, from small packages to large freight consignments, using different modes of transportation such as maritime, air, rail, and road.\nCarrier haulage refers to a transportation arrangement where the carrier, typically the ocean shipping line or its designated transport provider, is responsible for arranging and paying for the inland transportation of containers. In this scenario, the carrier takes charge of moving the container from the port of discharge to the final destination or vice versa, using their own transportation assets or subcontracted carriers.\nA carrier scorecard is a performance measurement tool used by supply chain and logistics professionals to evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of their freight carriers. It provides a standardized way to assess carriers based on various performance metrics, helping organizations make informed decisions about their logistics partners\nA certificate of origin is a document issued by an authorized body or organization that certifies the country in which the goods being shipped were manufactured, produced, or processed. It serves as a declaration by the exporter to the customs authorities of the importing country, providing information about the origin of the goods and facilitating trade by ensuring compliance with trade agreements, tariffs, and regulations.\nA commercial invoice is a crucial document used in international trade transactions to provide details of the goods being shipped and their corresponding value. It serves as a formal request for payment from the buyer to the seller and is essential for customs clearance and regulatory compliance.\nIn shipping, a commodity refers to bulk goods or raw materials that are transported in large volumes as part of global trade.\nIn the realm of supply chain and logistics, the term ""Consignee"" refers to the individual, company, or entity to whom a shipment of goods is delivered. The consignee is the designated recipient or receiver of the goods, typically identified by name and address on shipping documents such as the bill of lading or delivery order.\nConsignment inventory is a supply chain arrangement where a supplier (consignor) retains ownership of goods while they are held at a customer\'s (consignee\'s) location. The consignee only pays for the goods when they are sold or consumed, and the supplier retains responsibility for managing and replenishing the inventory as needed.\nIn shipping and logistics, a consignor refers to the entity or person who is the sender or shipper of goods. The consignor is responsible for initiating the shipment of goods from one location to another, typically to a consignee or recipient.\nA container depot is a facility used for the storage, maintenance, and repair of empty shipping containers when they are not actively in use for transportation.\nContainer discharge is the process of unloading shipping containers from a vessel at a port, using cranes and other equipment, for onward transportation.\nA container freight station (CFS) is a designated facility where goods are received, sorted, and prepared for onward transportation, enhancing efficiency in logistics operations.\nShipping container grades classify containers based on their condition and suitability for transporting goods, ranging from cargo-worthy to as-is quality.\nA container packing certificate is a document that verifies the proper packing and loading of goods into a shipping container. It attests that the contents have been securely packed, arranged, and secured according to industry standards and regulatory requirements. Obtaining a container packing certificate is crucial for compliance with international shipping regulations and contractual obligations. It provides assurance that the goods have been properly prepared for transport, minimizing the risk of delays, damages, or disputes during the shipment process.\nA container rollover occurs when a shipping container is not loaded onto its scheduled vessel and is instead \'rolled over\' to a subsequent vessel. This delay means the container misses its intended departure and must wait for the next available sailing, which can significantly impact lead times and delivery schedules.\nContainer stripping (devanning) is the process of unloading cargo from a shipping container at its destination for inspection, storage, or further distribution.\nContainer stuffing is the process of loading cargo into a shipping container in a safe and space-efficient manner for transportation.\nCross docking is a logistics strategy where incoming goods from suppliers are unloaded from incoming trucks or containers and directly loaded onto outbound trucks or trailers, with minimal or no storage time in between. Essentially, it involves transferring goods directly from the inbound dock to the outbound dock, bypassing the need for traditional warehousing storage.\nA customs broker is a licensed professional who specializes in facilitating the clearance of goods through customs barriers for importers and exporters. Acting as intermediaries between businesses and customs authorities, customs brokers ensure compliance with regulations and smooth passage of goods across international borders.\nCustoms clearance refers to the process of fulfilling the legal requirements necessary to facilitate the import or export of goods across international borders. This procedure ensures that shipments comply with local laws and regulations, allowing them to enter or leave a country legally. It involves various documentation, inspections, and payments of duties and taxes.\nA customs manifest lists in detail all the bills of lading issued by a carrier, its agent or master for a specific voyage and port call. It is a detailed summary of the total cargo of a vessel and is used principally for customs purposes. It acts as a declaration to customs authorities, ensuring compliance with regulations and facilitating smooth movement of goods through ports and checkpoints.\nThe latest point in time where a container has to be delivered to a terminal to be loaded on a vessel, or where certain documentation has to be provided by the Shipper.Example: CY cut-off, FCL cut-off, VGM cut-off, DG cut-off.\nCycle counting is a methodical approach to inventory management where a subset of inventory is counted on a continuous basis, typically throughout the year. Unlike traditional annual or periodic inventory counts that halt operations, cycle counting allows businesses to maintain regular operations while ensuring accurate stock levels.\nDAP, or Delivered At Place, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s obligation to deliver goods to a designated location in the buyer\'s country. In DAP terms, the seller is responsible for all costs and risks associated with delivering the goods to the agreed-upon destination. This includes arranging transportation, handling charges, and insurance up to the point of delivery. The buyer, however, is responsible for unloading the goods, handling customs clearance, and paying any import duties and taxes once the goods arrive at the destination.\nDDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping terms dictate that the seller assumes all responsibilities and costs associated with delivering the goods to the buyer\'s specified destination. This includes transportation, insurance, handling charges, and import duties and taxes. Essentially, the seller handles everything from the point of origin to the final delivery location, ensuring the goods arrive ready for use by the buyer without any additional costs or logistical burdens.\nDDU, or Delivered Duty Unpaid, is an international shipping term that defines the responsibilities of the seller and buyer. Under DDU terms, the seller delivers the goods to a specified destination in the buyer\'s country, covering all costs and risks associated with transportation, except for duties, taxes, and other import charges which are the responsibility of the buyer. The seller\'s obligations include arranging and paying for freight, insurance, and handling charges until the goods reach the agreed-upon place.\nDPU, or Delivered at Place Unloaded, is a term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s responsibility to deliver and unload goods at a designated location in the buyer\'s country. Under DPU terms, the seller bears all costs and risks associated with transporting and unloading the goods at the agreed destination. This includes all transportation costs, including freight, insurance, and handling charges, up to and including the unloading of the goods at the destination. The buyer then takes over responsibility for import duties, taxes, customs clearance, and any further transport to the final destination. \nA dangerous goods declaration (DGD) is a legal document required for the transportation of hazardous materials or dangerous goods by air, sea, road, or rail. It provides detailed information about the nature, classification, packaging, and handling requirements of the dangerous goods being transported. The DGD helps ensure compliance with international regulations and facilitates the safe handling and transport of hazardous materials throughout the supply chain.\nâ\x80\x8dDeadheading is the practice of operating a commercial vehicle, such as a truck or a trailer, without any cargo or paying passengers. Essentially, it refers to the movement of a vehicle while it is empty, either on its way to pick up a load or after delivering a load to its destination.\nDeadweight tonnage (DWT) is a measure of a ship\'s carrying capacity, representing the total weight of cargo, fuel, crew, provisions, and other materials that the vessel can safely carry. \nDemurrage refers to the additional charges imposed on the owner or operator of a vessel, freight car, or truck for delaying the use of equipment or facilities beyond the agreed-upon time. In the context of maritime shipping, demurrage applies to the time that cargo remains at the port or terminal beyond the allotted free time for loading or unloading.\nDetention charges are fees incurred when a carrier\'s equipment, such as containers or trailers, is held beyond the agreed-upon free time at a facility, such as a port, terminal, or warehouse. These charges compensate the carrier for the additional time their equipment is detained and unavailable for other use.\nA supply chain digital twin replicates the entire supply chain network, including assets, facilities, products, and processes, in a digital environment. It enables real-time monitoring, analysis, and simulation of supply chain operations to improve efficiency, optimize decision-making, and mitigate risks.\nDimensional weight, also known as volumetric weight, is a pricing technique used by shipping carriers to calculate the cost of shipping packages based on their volume rather than just their actual weight. This method helps carriers account for the space that a package occupies in relation to its weight, ensuring fair pricing for shipping services.\nA dock receipt is a logistics document issued by a carrier or its agent to acknowledge the receipt of goods at a shipping dock or terminal for transportation. It serves as a temporary receipt until the goods are loaded onto a vessel or other mode of transportation for shipment to their destination. The dock receipt contains essential information about the cargo, such as the quantity, description, condition, and destination, along with details about the carrier, shipper, and consignee.\nA shipâ\x80\x99s draft (draught) measures the depth of the vessel below the waterline, which determines the minimum water depth required for safe navigation.\n\nDrayage refers to the transportation of goods over a short distance, typically within the same metropolitan area or between nearby facilities. It plays a crucial role in the logistics and supply chain industry, linking various points in the transportation network, such as ports, rail terminals, and distribution centers. Drayage often involves moving goods from a transportation hub like a port to a nearby warehouse or vice versa.\nDrop shipping is a retail fulfillment method where a store doesnâ\x80\x99t keep the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product using the drop shipping model, it purchases the item from a third party and has it shipped directly to the customer.\nDry bulk cargo refers to unpackaged, loose commodities that are shipped in large quantities and typically consist of raw materials. These goods are usually loaded directly into the holds of a vessel without any packaging, making them different from containerized or break bulk cargo. \nA booking received via Electronic Data Interchange, a standard electronic format for exchanging business documents within the supply chain, such as purchase orders, invoices, shipping notices, and other transactional information.\nAn Economic Operators Registration and Identification (EORI) number is a unique identifier assigned to businesses engaged in international trade within the European Union (EU) and certain other countries. It serves as a means of tracking and identifying entities involved in import, export, and other customs-related activities.\nIn shipping, ETA refers to the anticipated arrival time of a vessel, truck, or aircraft at a specified port or delivery location. It is calculated based on various factors such as the departure time, transit duration, and any potential delays due to weather, customs, or other unforeseen circumstances. This prediction helps logistics professionals plan and coordinate the movement of goods, ensuring timely deliveries and efficient supply chain management.\nEXW, or Ex Works, is one of the Incoterms (International Commercial Terms) published by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). It defines the responsibilities of buyers and sellers in international transactions. Under EXW terms, the seller fulfills their obligation by making the goods available for pickup at their premises (factory, warehouse, etc.). The buyer assumes all risks and costs associated with transporting the goods from the sellerâ\x80\x99s location to the final destination.\nEconomic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that determines the optimal quantity of goods a company should order to minimize total inventory costs. It balances the costs of holding inventory (holding costs) and the costs of ordering inventory (ordering costs) to find the most cost-effective quantity to order at any given time.\nAn Electronic Product Code (EPC) is a unique identifier used to distinguish individual items, cases, or pallets in the supply chain. It serves as a digital identifier that provides a standardized way to track and manage products throughout their lifecycle, from manufacturing to distribution to retail.\nUsed for storing cargo in/on during transport. The equipment ""size/type"" is defined by the ISO 6346 code. The most common equipment size/type is 20\'/40\'/45\' Dry Freight Container, but a number of different versions exist.\nConfirmation & receipt of the equipment loaded/discharged on a vessel during a port call. This information is recorded by the terminal operator and sent to the carrier. This is often done using the EDI message - COARRI. The COARRI message reports that the equipment specified have been discharged from a seagoing vessel (discharged as ordered, over landed or short landed), or have been loaded into a seagoing vessel.\nA shipping exception is an unexpected event or disruption that causes a shipment to deviate from its planned delivery schedule.\nExpedited freight refers to a specialized service in logistics and supply chain management aimed at transporting goods quickly and efficiently to meet tight delivery deadlines. It is used when standard shipping methods cannot meet the required delivery timeframe, typically due to urgent customer needs, production delays, or unforeseen circumstances.\n\nFAS, or Free Alongside Ship, is a shipping term used in international trade that specifies the seller\'s responsibilities and costs up to the point where goods are placed alongside the buyer\'s vessel at the designated port of shipment. The buyer then assumes all risks and costs from that point forward.\nFCA, or Free Carrier, is an Incoterm (International Commercial Term) used in international trade to define the point at which the seller\'s obligations are fulfilled and the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods. Under FCA, the seller delivers the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier or another party nominated by the buyer at a specified place. \nFCL (Full Container Load) freight involves shipping an entire container for a single shipper, offering faster and more secure transport, especially for large-volume cargo.\nFOB, or Free on Board, is a term used in international trade to indicate when ownership and liability for goods transfer from the seller to the buyer. It specifies the point at which the seller is no longer responsible for the goods. This term is crucial for determining who pays for shipping, insurance, and other logistics costs, as well as who bears the risk during transit.\nAn entity operating a feeder service - ref. Feeder vessel.\nA container feeder vessel, also known as a feeder ship, is a relatively small cargo vessel that is specifically designed for transporting containers between smaller ports or terminals to larger hub ports where mainline vessels operate. These vessels serve as a crucial link in the global shipping network by facilitating the distribution of cargo to and from regional ports that may not be accessible to larger ships due to navigational constraints or limited infrastructure.\n\nA Feedermax container ship is a medium-sized vessel used to transport containers between regional ports and major ports, connecting smaller markets to global shipping routes.\nFill rate in supply chain management refers to the measurement of how fully customer demand for a product or service is met through the availability of inventory. It indicates the percentage of customer orders or demand that can be fulfilled immediately from stock, without backorders or delays.\nA ""Flag of Convenience"" (FOC) refers to the practice of a ship\'s owner registering a merchant vessel in a country other than the ownerâ\x80\x99s country of origin to benefit from more favorable regulations, often related to taxes, labor laws, and safety standards. This practice allows shipowners to operate under less stringent regulations, often reducing operational costs and increasing profitability. However, FOC can also lead to concerns about safety, environmental standards, and working conditions for crew members, as the regulatory oversight in these flag states might not be as rigorous.\n4PL, or Fourth Party Logistics, refers to a logistics model where a single organization, known as the fourth-party logistics provider, takes on the responsibility of managing and coordinating the entire supply chain on behalf of the client. Unlike traditional third-party logistics (3PL) providers, who primarily handle specific logistics functions, 4PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain management services. 4PL providers act as strategic partners, overseeing multiple 3PLs and other service providers to optimize supply chain operations, enhance efficiency, and achieve cost savings for their clients.\nA free trade zone (FTZ) is a designated area within a country where goods can be imported, stored, manufactured, or exported without being subject to the usual customs duties and tariffs. \nA freight forwarder is a vital link in the supply chain, specializing in the coordination and management of international shipments. Acting as an intermediary between shippers and carriers, freight forwarders handle various logistics tasks such as booking cargo space, arranging transportation, preparing documentation, and managing customs clearance.\nFreight visibility (also called shipment visibility) refers to the ability of supply chain professionals to track and monitor the movement of freight shipments throughout the supply chain. It involves gaining real-time insights into the location and status of goods as they move through various transportation modes and stages of the logistics process.\n\nFull truckload (FTL) freight refers to shipments that occupy the entire capacity of a truck trailer. Unlike less than truckload (LTL) shipments, FTL shipments do not share space with other cargo, allowing for direct transportation from the point of origin to the destination without intermediate stops.\nThe GLEC (Global Logistics Emissions Council) framework is a globally recognized standard developed to measure and report greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from logistics activities. It provides guidelines and best practices for calculating emissions across various modes of transport, including road, rail, sea, and air. \nThe action of moving a container from a container yard, a terminal or another restricted/controlled area.\nThe German Supply Chain Act, also known as Lieferkettengesetz, is a landmark legislation enacted to promote corporate social responsibility and ensure ethical practices throughout global supply chains. Introduced in 2021, the law applies to German companies with over 3,000 employees, requiring them to monitor and address human rights abuses, environmental violations, and labor standards in their supply chains.\nA Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) is a unique identifier assigned to products in the supply chain to facilitate efficient tracking and management from production to point of sale. It provides a standardized method for identifying items globally, ensuring accurate inventory control, and enabling seamless transactions between trading partners.\n\nA Goods Receipt Note (GRN) is a document used in the process of confirming the receipt of goods from a supplier or vendor. It serves as an acknowledgment by the receiving party, typically a warehouse or a buyer, that the goods specified in the accompanying purchase order have been received in satisfactory condition. \nGreen logistics refers to the process of minimizing the environmental impact of logistics and supply chain activities, including transportation, warehousing, packaging, and distribution.\nA Handysize ship is a small to medium-sized bulk carrier designed for transporting various cargo types, capable of navigating smaller ports and shallow waters.\nGear used to do inland transportation of a container. This can include tools and apparatus used to load/discharge the container onto the intermodal type.\nSpecifications for a haulier set by a carrier in regards to a specific work order, e.g. timeline, capabilities.\nThe joint term for merchant and carrier haulage. It should be noted that a shipment can have several types of haulage throughout the transport from origin to destination.\nA haulier, also known as a trucking company or a carrier, is a business or individual that transports goods by road using trucks or lorries. Hauliers play a vital role in the transportation industry, moving goods between locations such as warehouses, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities, ports, and retail stores. \nA House Bill of Lading (HBL) is a transportation document issued by a freight forwarder or Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (NVOCC) to acknowledge receipt of goods for shipment. It serves as a contract of carriage between the shipper and the carrier and includes details such as the type, quantity, and destination of the goods being transported. \nIn supply chain logistics, a hub and spoke model refers to a system where goods or services are transported through a central hub to various spoke locations. The hub acts as a central point for collection, sorting, and distribution, while the spokes represent the routes connecting the hub to different destinations.\nPort Congestion Holds Steady at Major Hubs as Mid-Sized Ports Struggle \nPort congestion is an inevitable consequence of typhoons and hurricanes, geopolitical disruption in the Red Sea and USEC labor action.\nFollowing similar events in Bangladesh in August, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports were forced to halt operations due to Typhoon Bebinca in September. But XL ports (those with an annual throughput greater than 10M TEU) have proven their resilience and ability to absorb much of the impact of such events. Despite the weather related disruptions, both Ningbo and Shanghai ports recorded lower average vessel anchor and container dwell times in September compared to August.\nMedium sized ports, however, are more likely to be feeling the effects of the endless series of supply chain crises. Average anchor times at ports with annual throughput between 500,000 and 4,000,000 TEU consistently see average vessel anchor times in excess of their larger counterparts. In September, seven of the ten most congested ports (by anchor time) fall into this category. These ports also see more volatility in congestion levels. Looking at the difference between the min and max monthly average anchor times over the past six months, medium sized ports occupy the top three spots: Charleston (3.5 days), Chittagong (3.0 days) and Durban (2.8 days).Â\xa0\nVessel Anchor Times: September 2024\nNo XL ports reported average anchor times of more than half a day. Among the world\'s largest ports, Shanghai and Jebel Ali reported the longest average vessel waiting time at 0.4 days each.Â\xa0\nAmong large ports (4-10MÂ\xa0TEU), Santos added nearly half a day to average anchor times, continuing a trend of worsening conditions at Brazilâ\x80\x99s largest container port. Manila registered a minor improvement but remains far more congested than competing Southeast Asian ports.Â\xa0\nVancouver (+1.1 days) was the only port to see average anchor times increase by more than a day in September. Houston (+0.5 days), Santos (+0.5 days), Charleston (+0.4 days) and Colombo (+0.4 days) registered the next biggest month-on-month increases. Notably, Chittagong shaved two days off average wait times following the floods and civic action that plagued operations in July and August.Â\xa0\n\xa0Port\n\xa0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\xa0Change vs. August (days)\n\xa0Santos (Brazil)\n\xa02.5\n\xa0 +0.5\n\xa0Manila (Philippines)\n\xa02.2\n\xa0-0.1\n\xa0Savannah (USA)\n\xa01.1\n\xa0-0.1\n\xa0Piraeus (Greece)\n\xa00.8\n\xa0NC\n\xa0Colombo (Sri Lanka)\n\xa00.5\n\xa0+0.4\n\xa0Port\n\xa0Average vessel anchor time (days)\n\xa0Change vs. August (days)\n\xa0Durban (South Africa)\n\xa02.8\n\xa0 +0.3\n\xa0Chittagong (Bangladesh)\n\xa01.9\n\xa0-2.0\n\xa0Vancouver (Canada)\n\xa01.7\n\xa0+1.1\n\xa0Lomé (Togo)\n\xa00.9\n\xa0-0.2\n\xa0Tema (Ghana)\n\xa00.9\n\xa0NC\nContainer Dwell Times: September 2024\nLooking at congestion on the ground, average container dwell times exceeded seven days at 14 of 78 analyzed ports.Â\xa0\nMedium volume ports in Djibouti (10.0 days), Chittagong (9.3 days) and Guayaquil (8.6 days), took the top three spots.

"['Traffic Signals\nReport a Problem\nTo report a problem with a traffic or pedestrian signal, call 311. Please have the exact location of the problem ready.\nNYC DOT\'s contractors are required to arrive at the scene of the most serious problems (e.g., all lights out, or a knocked-down pole) within two hours of notification. If a bulb is out, contractors are required to respond within 48 hours.\nAccessible Pedestrian Signals\nNYC DOT installs special signals at crosswalks to assist pedestrians who are blind or have low vision. The signals make sounds and vibrate when pedestrians push a button installed at the crosswalk.\r\n  Learn more and see a list of all accessible pedestrian signals in New York City\nView a list of accessible pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\nContact NYC DOT online to report a problem or request a new APS\n\nFlashing Yellow Arrow Turn Signals\nTurn signals reduce injuries for pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as improve safety, comfort and mobility for motorists. This video shows two examples of flashing yellow arrow left turn signals in New York City.\n\nSignal Timing\nExclusive Pedestrian Signals\nAt some intersections, NYC DOT programs traffic signals with an interval that stops traffic in all directions, giving pedestrians an exclusive time to cross the street.\r\n  View a list of exclusive pedestrian signals on NYC Open Data\n\nLeading Pedestrian Interval Signals\nTraffic signals at some intersections give pedestrians a head start to cross the street before car traffic. The goal of these signals is to improve street safety by giving pedestrians a chance to begin crossing the street before cars make turns across the crosswalk.\r\n  View a list of leading pedestrian intervals on NYC Open Data\nView the locations of leading pedestrian intervals on the Vision Zero View map\n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Traffic Signals\nWhat does a traffic signal do?\nA traffic signal controls the right-of-way for vehicles arriving at an intersection, which can reduce traffic delay and accident-producing conflicts. It also makes an intersection safe by determining whether vehicles or pedestrians should proceed.\nDoes a traffic signal control speed?\nNo. In some areas where speeding is a problem, residents believe that a traffic signal is needed to address the speeding problem. In fact, traffic signals sometimes result in greater speeds as drivers accelerate to try to get through the signal before it turns red. Other traffic control measures, such as speed humps, speed limit signs, and traffic enforcement, are more effective in controlling speed.\nHow many traffic signals are there in New York City?\nAs of March 2022, there were 13,543 intersections with traffic signals citywide, including 2,862 in Manhattan, 1,768 in the Bronx, 4,848 in Brooklyn, 3,432 in Queens and 633 in Staten Island.\nHow long does it take lights to change?\nSignal timing cycle lengths usually fall between 45 and 120 seconds. The timing for each signal is determined based on traffic volume and traffic patterns in each particular area.\nA traffic signal\'s cycle is too long or too short, will NYC DOT change it?\nSometimes the presence of a traffic signal will result in changes in the previous traffic patterns, as some drivers seek alternative routes to avoid the signal. This may mean that the current signal timing is no longer appropriate. If you believe that the timing of a particular signal is incorrect, contact the NYC DOT Commissioner with your request. NYC DOT will conduct a study of traffic patterns to determine if any adjustments are needed. A study will take approximately 12 weeks.\nHow can I request a new traffic signal?\nYou can request the installation of a traffic signal by writing to the NYC DOT Commissioner. You can also request an accessible pedestrian signal, which plays audible messages to assist visually impaired users.\nHow does NYC DOT decide whether a traffic signal should be installed at an intersection?\nNYC DOT uses a detailed process called an intersection control study to determine if traffic signals or multi-way stop signs are appropriate for a location. The study includes (but is not limited to) these steps:\nWhat are the Federal Guidelines for traffic signals?\nThe federal standards for traffic control devices can be found in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), which is published by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). The MUTCD establishes criteria known as ""warrants"" which are used to determine if a new traffic signal is appropriate.\nThe latest edition of the MUTCD, published in 2009, sets forth nine warrants, which are summarized below.\r\nLearn more about the MUTCD on the FHWA web site\nWhat is the Red Light Camera Program?\nThe Red Light Camera Program uses technology that enables NYC DOT to automatically take high-resolution photographs of vehicles that go through red lights, including close-ups of the license plates. Summonses are issued to the owners of the vehicles, as with parking violations. The photos are included with the summonses. The City had the first full-time red light photographic enforcement program in the United States, and was the first jurisdiction to send photos to respondents as part of the summons.\nAre red light cameras effective in preventing drivers from running red lights?\nStudies have shown a 40 percent decrease in the total number of incidents of motorists going through red lights at the locations where cameras have been installed. That means fewer accidents, making New York City much safer for pedestrians and other motorists.\nSince the Red Light Camera program began in December 1993, more than 4 million summonses have been issued through 2007. Because the summonses include photographs of the vehicle going through the intersection, very few motorists have contested the summonses. About 88% have been found guilty.\nIn April 1998, legislation was enacted that authorized NYC DOT to install cameras at 50 locations throughout New York City. In June 2006, legislation was enacted authorizing an additional 50 cameras. Another 50 cameras, for a total of 150, were authorized in legislation enacted in April 2009.\r\nLearn about paying and contesting red light camera violations from the Department of Finance\n  \n\nWebsite Feedback\n\n\n', ""News\nTotality angst: Dallas-Fort Worth avoids traffic woes during total solar eclipse\nOfficials issued safety notices, warned of emergency-like conditions and shut down major highway ramps into downtown Dallas in advance of the April 8 eclipse.\nBy Maggie Prosser, Philip Jankowski, Amber Gaudet and Irving Mejia-HilarioStaff Writers\nStaff Writers\nEditor’s note: This story is part of The Dallas Morning News’ coverage of the 2024 total solar eclipse. For more, visit dallasnews.com/eclipse.\nAny given day, the Buc-ee’s in Temple serves as a haven for wayward people, weary travelers and commuters headed to or from Austin or Dallas.\nBut on Monday, the chipper Beaver looming over a stretch of Interstate 35 welcomed visitors to the 124-pump, mega pit stop oasis, offering more than smoked brisket, bathrooms and ample parking: The buck-toothed mascot had front-row seats to a once-in-lifetime celestial event.\n“After we scouted the area, we went off our checklist. Gas, food, clean bathrooms,” Shannon Murphy, 41, said. “That’s Buc-ee’s.”\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\xa0Terms of Service\xa0and\xa0Privacy Policy\nA few cars over, Lucy Valedez crocheted a blanket with stripes of sky blue, lilac, sunflower yellow and light green in her camping chair. Lucy and her husband, José Valedez, traveled from Bryan.\n“We figured, if we’re going to travel, we’d go somewhere that had parking,” José Valedez said.\nTravel woes gnawed at eclipse goers ahead of the event Monday, prompting officials to issue safety notices, warn of emergency-like conditions, and even shut down major highway on-ramps into downtown Dallas, fearing traffic jams.\nThe angst came and went as quickly as totality: There were no major traffic problems reported Monday in Dallas, even with the influx of visitors and eclipse chasers. Local hospitals did not immediately report any patients with eye injuries. And the state’s energy reserves held steady.\nThe Texas Department of Transportation predicted 1 million people will have visited the Lone Star state for optimal viewing of the total solar eclipse. The path of totality stretched across more than 480 Texas miles, reaching from the Rio Grande to the Red River.\nAll hands on deck at Buc-ee’s\nAt the Buc-ee’s nearly midway between Austin and Dallas, pitmaster Randy Pauly — donning Wrangler jeans, a cowboy hat and red and blue Buc-ee’s brand shirt stitched with his name — handed out eclipse glasses to employees.\nMonday was an all-hands-on-deck situation for Buc-ee’s, Pauly said, akin to the busiest travel days as people fanned out across the area of totality chasing clear skies.\n“It’s Super Bowl weekend for us,” he said. Pauly jumped in a photograph with perhaps the most visible staffer at Buc-ee’s: chief of cutting meat, Ginette Cortes, before she carved up a smoked brisket. Pauly said he expected this location to go through at least 100 briskets Monday, topping about 1,000 pounds of smoked beef rolled up into breakfast tacos and other fare.\nPauly said he wants to show out-of-state visitors “a little bit of Texas.”\n“It’s pretty wild,” Craig Kleine said of the enormous gas station. Kleine, of Tucson, Ariz., was headed about 90 miles north to Cleburne to view the eclipse. Interstate 35 moved freely throughout the morning, as travelers regularly made stops at the Buc-ee’s pumps or inside the store.\nCommuters had yet to feel the effects, even as hundreds of early birds weaved and snaked in lines outside the Dallas Zoo and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, staked out lawn spots in Dealey Plaza or on the shores of White Rock Lake, and applied sunscreen under cloudy skies while compulsively checking the weather radar.\nLinda Hampton left about 6:15 a.m. and trekked 43 miles down U.S. Highway 75 to the Dallas Arboretum. Traffic on Dallas-area roads and highways remained light Monday morning and throughout totality, according to TxDOT.\nHampton’s early departure wasn’t out of concern for traffic, rather her husband was responsible for the garden’s petting zoo, and top of mind for her and others was whether the dense clouds would soften by 12:20 p.m., when the eclipse began.\n“We’re happy for the sunshine — yes, yes, yes, yes!,” said an elated Hampton, 75, as the diamond portion of the eclipse peeked out from behind the clouds, providing an aura of optimism. The initial forecast left some forlorn, worrying the moon’s traversal in front of the sun would be obscured. The outlook began to brighten around lunchtime, but storms and severe weather were expected Monday evening.\nMore than 450,000 visitors\nGlobetrotters journeyed from all corners of the region (Garland, Mansfield, Gun Barrel City and Grand Prairie), the country (California, Florida and New York) and even internationally (Colombia, Germany and France) to witness the first total eclipse in North Texas since 1878.\nEarly estimates from city leaders expected up to a 35% increase in visitors, or more than 450,000 people. More accurate counts may not come until later.\nMinnesotans Ralph and Kim Haefner scooped up a vacation rental last February as hotel reservations were filling up. City officials expected 90% of the city’s roughly 35,000 hotel rooms to be booked by Monday.\n“Millions of years from now, as the moon keeps getting slightly farther and farther away from the Earth over time, it’ll be too small to cover the sun,” said Ralph Haefner, an eclipse chaser. The couple spent early Monday scoping out the best view at Bachman Lake. “It’s just this weird little coincidence that you can see this amazing spectacle.”\nAstronomy student Andrés Torres, 21, traveled to Dallas from Bogotá, Colombia, by way of Miami and Austin to fulfill his dream of witnessing a total eclipse. From Founders Plaza in downtown Dallas, Torres propped up a professional telescope on a tripod.\n“It was a long trip,” he said. “[The eclipse] is already starting, I’m so excited.”\nAs the eclipse began, Donnie, a 5-year-old pit bull, took refuge under trees and patchy shade near Reunion Tower. Donnie, with his humans Mark Ebanks and Autumn Flowers in tow, made the 14-hour trip from Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday, arriving in Dallas just after 2 a.m. Monday.\nThe trip was spontaneous, “spur of the moment,” said Ebanks, who didn’t know about the eclipse until Flowers, a self-described space nerd, told him about it last week.\nDonnie, Ebanks and Flowers planned to drive back to Florida after totality ended. They hadn’t given much thought to traffic concerns, other than a potential stop in Louisiana for crawfish.\n‘Rolling’ closures of highway exits\nDallas police issued temporary rolling closures of highway exits headed into downtown from about 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. in anticipation of traffic jams as totality ended and people left their viewing spots en masse. Despite the closures, traffic flowed smoothly after the eclipse and there were no issues to report, according to a Dallas police spokesperson.\n“We didn’t see a dramatic increase in traffic right after the totality, and I think that indicates that people were just preparing themselves to stay a little bit later and avoid some of that traffic,” Texas Department of Transportation spokesperson Tony Hartzel said.\nThe state’s most critical infrastructure also held strong during the total solar eclipse. ERCOT’s grid never dipped below normal operating conditions during the entirety of the eclipse, a spokesperson told The Dallas Morning News.\nThe state’s top hospitals, including Parkland Health, Baylor Scott & White Health and Methodist Health System, did not report an increase in new patients because of the eclipse Monday afternoon.\nCloud cover at Buc-ee’s\nThe Buc-ee’s pitstop filled with more than 200 people in camping chairs and on picnic blankets; totality came and went with some tension. With minutes to go until full moon cover, low-flying dark clouds blocked visibility. People took off their eclipse glasses amid worried groans as they tried to catch the sliver of the sun as the sky darkened.\nThen, less than a minute before totality, the clouds cleared, the sky darkened and cheers rang out. People settled into their awe and quietly marveled at the orange horizon clearly visible from all sides of the flat, field-lined gargantuan parking lot. A few planets were seen near the sun while the temperature dipped and the solar corona became visible.\n“It just makes me remember there is so much going on out there,” said Kelsey Appleton, an Atlanta resident there with her parents, Bob and Margaret Appleton, from College Station. “I’m just a part of it.”\n“I just felt like this might be the only chance in my life to see one,” Bob Appleton said. “I’m grateful.”\nWithin 30 minutes, the vast majority of spectators of the cosmic event had left, leaving to clear traffic.\nStaff writers Maria Halkias, Leah Waters, Anna Butler, Nicholas Wooten and Marcela Rodrigues contributed to this report.\nMaggie writes about public safety and criminal courts.

"['Miracle on Ashland Avenue: Despite past pushback from neighbors, bus line will be extended north to Ravenswood Metra\nThe route will run for about a mile north of Irving, opening up new commuting options and making it easier to access more jobs and businesses.\n9:21 PM CDT on May 27, 2024\nThe promised land for Ashland Avenue bus riders: Looking north from the northernmost northbound bus stop  on Ashland at Irving Park Road (4000 N.), towards the future bus service area on Ashland. \nUpdate 5/28/24, 3:40 PM: Today 47th Ward Chief of Staff Joshua Mark told Streetsblog that the new bus service on Ashland north of Irving Park will be launched in the late summer. ""I\'ll let CTA share the date at the meeting.""\nThey said it couldn\'t be done! And to be honest, I was a little skeptical myself.\nIt seemed highly unlikely that Chicago would ever extend the Ashland Avenue [1600 W.] bus corridor further than its current northernmost stop on Ashland at Irving Park Road [4000 N.] Some neighbors north of Irving have long opposed converting a few car-parking spots on the avenue to bus stops. They also made dubious claims that CTA traffic would damage their homes\' foundations. Read more about that issue at the end of this 2013 Streetsblog Chicago article.\nBut on Friday, local Ald. Matt Martin\'s (47th) newsletter announced  that the dream is becoming a reality.\nSo how did this victory for straphangers come to be? Ald. Martin\'s chief of staff Joshua Mark provided some background in the following discussion. We talked last week, but the ward asked Streetsblog to hold off on publicizing the news before it was shared with constituents. The interview has been edited slightly for clarity and brevity.\nJoshua Mark: [During an interview for another recent piece on the new campaign for bus rapid transit on Western Avenue (2400 W.)] We have gotten the CTA to extend the Ashland bus north on Ashland.\nJohn Greenfield: OK cool. [It took a moment for the significance of that statement to kick in.] Wow! How the heck did you do that? There were so many neighbors who were dead-set against it. Aren\'t people going to complain about losing car parking spots and ruining their foundations? How were you able to do something about that? Are there enough people living on Ashland north of Irving nowadays who want bus service?\nJM: Yes, there are a lot of people living on Ashland who want it. We have not encountered any public push-back.\nJG: Terrific. Please tell me more about the plan.\nJM: Obviously the Ashland bus currently does not go north of Irving Park. It instead makes a right on Irving and then terminates on Clark Street [about 1400 W. here] and Belle Plaine Avenue [4100 N.] It currently terminates in front of Graceland Cemetery. \nThe CTA has found that, although they\'re making it work, the current layover with the [protected/raised] bike lane on Clark [at Belle Plaine], they don\'t love it. It\'s a little too narrow and it\'s a little too much work. They were interested finding another place for their layovers.\nWe worked with them to identify a location for a new layover zone. So we eventually landed with them on extending the bus route to the Ravenswood Metra station. What this would mean is that the CTA bus will go north of Irving Park. It will go until Wilson Avenue [4600 N.] It will take a left on Wilson. Then it will take a right onto Ravenswood Avenue [1800 W.] and it will terminate in front of the Metra station. \nThis is not a massive extension of the route further north. It is around a mile. And this is fully within our ward. I would have, of course, loved for the CTA to agree to extend it further, but this is where they were willing to go. And we think the new route will not make a world of difference, but it will make a big difference for those who are impacted.\nThe CTA calculates that an additional 21,000 residents are going to now live within a half mile of the Ashland bus, which is obviously a huge change. And the Ashland bus is going to come now to within a half mile of an additional 15,000 jobs. It is going to allow for connections between the Ashland bus and the 78 Montrose bus, as well as the 81 Lawrence bus at the Metra station.\nThat\'s not to mention the connection to the Metra station itself, meaning that the bus will unlock a new commuting pattern for anyone heading downtown. If they live, say, near Lakeview High School [at Irving Park/Ashland], they could now get downtown by taking the Ashland bus north to Metra and then taking the train down if they wanted to. And, of course, it allows folks to go north on Metra to Ravinia or Waukegan. \nJG: Where will the bus stops be?\nJM: [Heading north on Ashland] there will be a bus stop at Irving Park, a bus stop at Berteau Avenue [4200 N.], and at Montrose, which will allow folks to have new access to businesses, including restaurants. For example, there\'s a Venezuelan place [BienMeSabe, 1637 W. Montrose Ave.]\nThen there\'s going to be a stop on Wilson and Ashland, where the bus makes the left. And there will be a stop at Wilson and Hermitage Avenue [1700 W.] And that will be it until the terminus at the Metra station. The layover zone is going to be between Leland Avenue [4700 N.] and Lawrence on the east side of Ravenswood, by the [ExtraSpace] storage facility.\nThe bus is going to stop very much in the middle of the block. Obviously a layover zone involves multiple buses. So it will take over one side of the street, the southern half. People will get out and they will be in the middle of the block. Depending on where they get off, they could enter the Metra station on either side.\nJG: Then what will the bus driver do?\nJM: That\'s the end of the line. So the new run will go north on Ravenswood, it will take a right on Lawrence, and then take another right to head south on Ashland. They\'re doing bus stops at every other block [a quarter mile between stops], so southbound it\'s going to be Lawrence, Wilson, Montrose, Berteau, and then Irving Park.\nI\'ve been speaking to neighbors\' associations to give them a heads-up. Personally, I used to live on Ashland north of Ainslie Avenue [4900 N.], so I would have take to Divvy [bike-share] down to the Divvy station at Ashland and Belle Plaine and then walk to Ashland and Irving to catch the Ashland bus.\nWhen I lived near Ashland and Ainslie, I had neighbors tell me we lived in a transit desert. That is a laughable statement when you consider that Ainslie is two blocks south of the Foster bus, one block west of the Clark bus, three blocks northeast of the Ravenswood Metra station, and two blocks north of the Lawrence bus.\nI still thought it was significant for people to say that, because when you\'re looking for that north-south connection, it is really an exception in Chicago to live off of a major street like Ashland and to not have access to a bus. And it makes it more difficult to have that easy north-south connection. [Clark Street runs northwest-southeast, so 2.25 miles south of Ainslie at Barry Avenue (3100 N.), Clark is located a mile east of Ashland at Halsted Street (800 W.)]\nIt\'s going to make a big difference for people and, in addition to just extending the line to more folks, it\'s about giving access to more places. As it stands, the bus layover zone is really in a no-man\'s land. It\'s in front of a vacant 7-11 (although that 7-11 may be reused soon, if you\'ve been following the 46th Ward zoning process).

U.K. drivers lost 61 hours on average, equal to £558 per driver and £7.5 billion nationally, and drivers in Germany lost 40 hours to traffic on average in 2023, equal to 427 € and 3.3 billion € nationally.\nOther important transport statistics/topics.

The average driver in the Los Angeles area spent 119 hours in rush hour traffic, according to the most recent data from the University of Austin, Texas’ 2019 Mobility Report. Three decades ago, the average LA driver spent 66 hours a year in traffic. The 2017 congestion numbers post an 80 percent increase in average hours a year for drivers stuck in traffic.\r\n \r\nWhile LA is famous for its traffic, this is not an LA-specific issue, with cities and towns both big and small posting significant increases in congestion over the past three-plus decades. An expanding nation and, as a result, a growing workforce are both factors at play in the increasing congestion plaguing American roadways. Since 1982, there are 50 percent more people in the workforce, and while people are increasingly working from home, most are still commuting to office space during peak hours. The only year-over-year decrease in congestion was between 2008 and 2009 when the U.S. economy was reeling from the worst economic contraction and high unemployment, the country had seen since the Great Depression.\r\n  \r\nPeople on the roadways pay for this congestion through their time, but the economy pays for these delays through costly inefficiencies. The annual cost of traffic delays per commuter has nearly doubled, rising to $1,010.

"['Boston Subway Map 2024 – Timetable, Tickets & Prices\n  \nSubway Boston (MTBA) – The route network\nThe Boston subway is a true monument to American history. The metro system is the oldest subway in the USA. It opened on September 1, 1887, just before the Chicago subway.\nOpened at the time as the “Street Subway”, the route is still part of the so-called Green Line with the oldest subway tunnel in the USA. Alongside the three modern metro lines, it is a special feature on the Boston Metro Map. The Green Line is actually an S-Bahn line, but a large part of it runs underground. At 37 kilometers, it is not only the longest, but also the busiest subway line in Boston, carrying around 230,000 passengers a day.\nAll lines are operated by Massachusetts Bay Transportation (MBTA). The subway network, affectionately known by Bostonians as “The T” or “Boston T”, stretches over a total length of around 120.3 kilometers. With 200,000 passengers per day, the Orange Line has the second largest passenger volume after the Green Line. The metro lines on the Boston Metro Map can only be distinguished by their color. To avoid confusion with other public transport lines, travelers should therefore remember the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Orange Line and the Green Line.\nInhaltsverzeichnis\nThe Boston subway lines at a glance\nInformation for tourists about the Boston Metro\nBoston owes its popularity as a travel destination and place to work and study not least to its famous universities. Harvard University and the New England Conservatory are particularly famous. However, it is not just students and commuters who use the transportation services of the “Boston T”. There are also plenty of tourists who want to see historically significant sites such as the Old State House, the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall or the USS Constitution.\nAccordingly, the number of people in Boston who use the Metro Map is also increasing. This is comparatively easy to accomplish due to the small number of lines. The most important connection for tourists is undoubtedly the Blue Line between the airport and the city center at the Government Center stop.\nBoston subway tickets & prices\nWith a population of just over 600,000, Boston is not exactly a small town. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the tariff system is very reminiscent of this. Instead of a complex system with several tariff zones, a flat-rate billing system is used. This also makes it much easier for non-residents to use the metro in Boston. This also limits the choice of tickets to a minimum.\nThey are valid for both the subway and the bus lines. In addition to one-way tickets, the operating company MTBA only offers daily, weekly and monthly tickets. Tickets are cheaper for senior citizens, the disabled and students. Boston’s subway is also very family-friendly. Children up to the age of 11 can travel free of charge on the metro.\nThe most important metro tickets in Boston\nIf you want to buy a metro ticket in Boston, you have several options. The most common option is to buy classic paper tickets, known as Charlie tickets. They are available from the ticket machines in front of the entrances to the subway platforms. If there is no ticket machine and validator to be found on a subway platform, tickets can often also be purchased on board the trains. However, only tickets with a value of up to 20 US dollars can be purchased at the ticket machines on board.\nUsing the CharlieCard is much more convenient. This is a rechargeable chip card that can be used to book tickets and also serves as a travel pass. It can be used as a one-way ticket, day ticket, weekly ticket and monthly ticket. The CharlieCard is particularly attractive because of the discount on the price of single trips. The CharlieCard is also validated or activated at the electronic access barriers to the platforms. There are no smartphone tickets for the metro in Boston, nor are there any special combined tickets for tourists. Such tickets are usually associated with discounts for attractions.\nBoston subway schedule\nThe Green Line starts its service at around 5:00 am. Service on the three remaining lines on the Boston Metro Map begins between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. This regulation applies on the Green Line and Blue Line seven days a week. On the Red Line and the Orange Line, however, the first trains on Sundays do not depart until an hour later at around 6:00 am. Both during the week and at weekends, all lines run until around 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. at night.\nThe frequency of the four metro lines on the Boston Metro Map varies throughout the day between a 3-minute interval during rush hour and a 9-15-minute interval in the late evening and night hours. So if you want to be out and about in Boston after 1:00 a.m., you have to use one of the city’s many cabs or the Uber service.\nRed Line, Orange Line, Blue Line, Green Line\nFurther information on the Boston Metro\nThe saying “other countries, other customs” applies not only to the USA in general, but also to the metro in Boston. There are some rules that may seem strange to the average European at first. Eating on the Boston subway is not prohibited, but if the food smells too strong, the employees of the operating company can issue a warning. Incidentally, no one should put up any resistance, as these employees are official security guards from the MBTA Police Department.\nSo safety on board is also well taken care of. Very loud conversations that disturb the other passengers are also worthy of a warning. Playing music loudly is prohibited both at subway stations and on the trains themselves. No less unusual is the clear permission to put your feet up on the seat, provided the subway carriage is largely empty.\n (No Ratings Yet)Loading...\n', 'Cookies on GOV.UK\nWe use some essential cookies to make this website work.\nWe’d like to set additional cookies to understand how you use GOV.UK, remember your settings and improve government services.\nWe also use cookies set by other sites to help us deliver content from their services.\nYou have accepted additional cookies.

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain’s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types.

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain’s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024.

The increase entails trains arriving every 8 to 9 minutes compared to their current schedule of every 10 to 11 minutes.\nPhase two begins in August, with a weekday midday service increase on the C, N, and R lines, which will cut train wait times by 2 minutes. Train service frequency will also increase on the 1 and 6 lines on weekends, with trains arriving every 6 minutes instead of every 8.\nIncreased train frequency will most definitely be a welcome sight this summer, as we all know how miserable the subway gets in the heat, especially considering the subway saw over one billion riders last year.\nBy December phase three will begin, which will increase weekday evening service on the C, N, and R lines as well as midday service on the G line. Trains on these lines will arrive every 8 minutes under the enhanced service.\n6-minute service on the 1 and 6 lines during the weekend will also be extended during this phase to encompass more hours of the day.\nFinally, the fourth and final phase will begin in July 2024. During this phase, weekday and evening service will increase on the B, D, J, and M lines with trains arriving every 8 minutes. The 3 and 5 lines will also see increased weekend service with trains arriving every 10 minutes.\n“The subway is the lifeblood of New York City, and that is why in this year’s state budget we made sure to deliver the necessary funding not just to shore up the MTA’s financing, but to enhance service as well,” said State Senator Liz Krueger.\nIn addition to the increased service, NYC’s Re-NEW-vation Program aims to renovate a total of 50 subway stations by the end of 2023.\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nDiscover our cities\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\nGET US IN YOUR INBOX\nSign up to our newsletter for the latest and greatest from your city\n\n\n  I accept terms & conditions\n\n\nTYPE IN YOUR SEARCH AND PRESS ENTER\nNo result\n']","In March 2024, the total vehicle miles traveled in Great Britain was 332.4 billion, with cars and taxis accounting for 252.5 billion of those miles.

A wintry storm on April 2-4 brought the large majority of Upper Michigan’s monthly snowfall and a wetter storm tracked across the region April 28-29. Percent of normal year-to-date precipitation increased at each observation site relative to March values (Table 2) signaling a continuation of the transition to above-normal precipitation that began in March. Temperatures trended closer to average during April, but all observations sites remain in the top 10 warmest January-April periods with temperature anomalies of +3°F to +7°F (Table 3). Despite the wetter pattern, the very warm start to the year melted the paltry seasonal snowpack during March resulting in much below-normal streamflow for most of Upper Michigan’s waterways during April (Figures 1-3). Warmth also maintained drought conditions, mainly across portions of western Upper Michigan where deficits in soil moisture continue to linger, but have improved since March (Figures 4, 7-9).

On Tuesday, the company announced the Waymo One app will be available to an 80-square-mile swath of greater LA — including Santa Monica, Hollywood and parts of South LA around the USC campus, among surrounding areas.  \nWith no one in the driver\'s seat, Waymo One\'s vehicles are fully autonomous, with the fleet made up entirely of fully electric Jaguar I-PACEs. Like rideshare apps such as Uber and Lyft, riders can hail a car 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\xa0\n""Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,"" Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a statement announcing the expansion into LA. ""Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We\'re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can\'t wait to serve more riders soon.""\nWaymo started out in Los Angeles with rides only available to people on a waiting list, which nearly 300,000 people ended up joining, according to the company. Waymo claims those rides resulted in an average rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars, with LA riders who were surveyed reporting 98% of them are satisfied with the service and 96% saying it was useful.\nThe company initially launched in San Francisco after getting approval from state regulators last year to charge for rides, after first offering its service in Phoenix\xa0beginning in 2020. Waymo rides in the Arizona city are available across a 315-square-mile area.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Transportation, reports fully-autonomous vehicles such as Waymo\'s robotaxi service can have some safety benefits as these cars may be able to detect threats of crashes humans don\'t. The agency says these vehicles, like all other automobiles, must be tested by the companies that make them and adhere to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards in place for all U.S. cars.\nHowever, some watchdog agencies and experts have warned of potential dangers. The National Transportation Safety Board issued recommendations for Tesla\'s Autopilot system in the early years of the launch of the driver-assisted technology. An NTSB\xa0investigation into a 2018 Culver City crash found the driver over relied on the system against the manufacturers\' warnings.\nMeanwhile, the MITRE Corporation, a nonprofit organization that manages federally funded research for U.S. government agencies in transportation and defense, released a report in 2021 calling for adjustments in federal safety regulations for fully-autonomous vehicles — saying such changes should be made as the safety approach in their manufacturing and development ""matures.""\n""Regulators have recognized this need in traditional vehicles and have codified it in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, and states require their own levels of driver certifications through licenses and behavioral testing,"" the report reads.\xa0\nLast year, General Motors\' own robotaxi service, Cruise, had its license revoked by California regulators and had to end its service in San Francisco amid safety concerns, including reports by police and fire officials who said the vehicles were impeding traffic during emergency situations while still in their testing phase, the Associated Press reported.\nMore from CBS News\nMarissa Wenzke is a journalist based in Los Angeles.

Due to their rapid rise in popularity, relatively light levels of regulation, and lack of available data on how, when, and why people use these services, city and transportation planners and researchers know alarmingly little about how ride-hailing is changing travel choices or how to plan for them in the future.\nNearly 10 years after these services were introduced, we still have limited research and few answers to key questions, including: To what extent do ride-hailing services influence vehicle ownership? Where is ride-hailing complementary to or competitive with public transit?\nMany public agencies responsible for transportation planning in the United States — typically metropolitan planning organizations and state transportation and environmental agencies — conduct travel surveys to gather data on vehicle ownership rates, trip-making patterns, and transportation mode choice. However, these custom surveys are costly and typically administered only every five to 10 years, which is not frequent enough given our rapidly changing transportation ecosystem. To address this gap in knowledge, our research has sought to better understand the relationships among ride-hailing services, demographics, and travel behavior.\nTo begin quantifying the adoption and travel behavior impacts of these services, we gathered data in major metropolitan areas of the United States through travel surveys designed by our team. Our survey asked questions about the adoption and utilization of shared mobility services, including carsharing, ride-hailing, bikeshare, and more recently, shared electric scooters. The results presented in our 2017 research report are based on data that were collected from fall 2015 through spring 2016 in seven metropolitan areas: Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. We employed sampling methods that regional planning agencies typically use to gather data from a statistically representative sample using rigorous methods so that we could draw defensible conclusions about the population at large.\nShared mobility: A diversifying landscape\nMuch of prior research on the behavioral impacts of shared mobility services focused on what we term “Carsharing 1.0,”\u200aearly models of carsharing where vehicles were picked up and returned to the same location, typically through hourly rentals. The shared mobility landscape has rapidly evolved and new services have been introduced, including free-floating car-sharing, ride-hailing (e.g. Uber and Lyft), and pooled or shared services (Table 1). A key takeaway from our recent research is that not all shared services should be viewed through this lens and that the adoption rates and behavioral impacts of different types of shared mobility services vary substantially.\nTable 1. The evolution of shared mobility services\n\nAmong these various forms of shared mobility, the rates of ride-hailing adoption have far outpaced the adoption rates of other shared mobility models. Carsharing 1.0 business models had attracted only 2 million members in North America and close to 5 million globally between the early 2000s and 2017. By contrast, ride-hailing services, such as Uber, Lyft, and Didi, are estimated to have grown to more than 250 million users globally during the 2010s alone. Our more recent research on “micromobility” services, such as shared bikes, electric bikes, and electric scooters, finds that the adoption rates of these services have grown at an even faster pace than for ride-hailing.\nAdoption of ride-hailing\nThe adoption rates, or share of the population that has used Uber or Lyft, in our study were significantly higher than those reported in previous research. While earlier studies found adoption rates of 10 to 15 percent, our 2015–2016 data found that 21 percent of adults had personally used ride-hailing services (measured as having installed and used a ride-hailing app), and an additional 9 percent of adults had used ride-hailing with friends. Our different results are likely due to our focus on major metropolitan areas and suggest that ride-hailing service use is increasingly widespread, particularly compared with adoption rates of previous generation carsharing services, which are roughly an order of magnitude smaller.\nSimilar to the higher ride-hailing adoption rates, we also found higher rates of utilization, or frequency of use, among ride-hailing users in cities. Nearly a quarter (24 percent) of ride-hailing users reported use on a daily to weekly basis. Such a significant portion of people relying on these services daily or weekly suggests that ride-hail is shifting from a niche to a mainstream travel option in many cities.\nSimilar to the adoption trends for new technologies and prior carsharing services, we found that early ride-hailing adopters tended to be younger, more educated, and have higher incomes than the rest of the population (Figure 1). Notably, we find women and minorities were more likely to adopt ride-hailing. There was a fairly significant gap in adoption between the youngest and oldest segments of the population. More than one-third (36 percent) of those between 18 and 29 years of age had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had. Although ride-hailing is often cited as a possible transportation solution for aging Baby Boomers, our research suggests very few of them currently utilize services like Uber and Lyft.\n\nMore than a third of 18- to 29-year-olds had used ride-hailing services, while only 4 percent of those 65 and older had.\n\nFigure 1. Ride-hailing adoption by demographics and geography, 2015-2016\n\nWealthier, more educated people use Uber and Lyft at much higher rates than those who are less affluent. The adoption rate among the college educated (26 percent) was double that of those without a college degree (13 percent). Those with advanced degrees also had slightly higher adoption rates than those with only a bachelor’s degree. Similarly, respondents with annual household incomes of $150,000 or more had an adoption rate of 33 percent, compared with only 15 percent among those earning $35,000 or less.\nWhile many observers herald these exciting new mobility options, their continuing growth presents significant challenges for the public sector. As officials and managers at cities and public transit agencies consider whether and how to integrate these services into publicly subsidized transportation networks, these gaps in adoption between the wealthy and the poor need to be addressed.\nVehicle ownership and driving\nTwo important questions facing transportation policymakers are whether the adoption of ride-hailing services might reduce vehicle ownership and total vehicle miles traveled. Contrary to prior research on the topic, we found that ride-hailing users on average do not own significantly fewer vehicles than their non-ride-hailing counterparts. We find, as others have, that the key drivers of vehicle ownership are household income, household structure, and urban density, the latter of which is strongly correlated with limited parking. Once these factors have been statistically controlled, we observe little difference in vehicle ownership between those who use ride-hailing and those who do not.\nWhen asked whether using Uber or Lyft had prompted them to decrease their ownership of motor vehicles, the vast majority of ride-hailing respondents (91 percent) reported making no vehicle ownership changes, while 16 percent indicated they had no vehicle to begin with. However, nearly one in 10 respondents (9 percent) said they had downsized by one or more household vehicles, which suggests that Uber and Lyft may indeed motivate long-range changes to vehicle ownership and use decisions.\nFrom an environmental perspective, a significant shift away from personal vehicle ownership is primarily of value inasmuch as it reduces vehicle-related emissions. While vehicle travel is correlated with emissions, the effect of ride-hailing on total vehicle travel is the subject of ongoing debate.\nWe found a strong correlation between reduced vehicle ownership and increased ride-hailing use (Figure 2). This suggests that such travelers are substituting trips in which they would have driven themselves with trips that are now driven by an Uber or Lyft driver.\nFigure 2. Vehicle shedding by ride-hailing utilization rate\n\nAs we ponder the future introduction of shared, automated vehicles, trip-making and travel mode choice (i.e., walk, bike, transit, carpool, drive, ride-hail, etc.) will be central to determining whether their introduction will result in more miles traveled, more congestion, and more energy use, or whether they will be deployed to provide mobility benefits with fewer negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.\nImpacts of ride-hailing on public transit\nThe extent to which ride-hailing complements or substitutes for public transit use will play a key role in whether Uber, Lyft, and potential automated vehicle services increase or decrease total vehicle travel. We addressed this question by assuming that not all public transit services are created equal. Some transit services are more frequent, reliable, and operate in environments where they are an especially convenient choice, while other services operating in less “transit-friendly” areas can be slow and inconvenient. In short, the question of whether ride-hailing competes with or complements public transit services depends on the context.\nWe asked survey respondents whether they use different public transit services, including buses, subways, and streetcars, more or less after they began using Uber and Lyft. The majority of respondents reported no change in their transit use. However, among the few who did report changing transit use, 6 percent said that they used bus services less and 3 percent said they used light rail (i.e., streetcars) less. By contrast, 3 percent of respondents reported increasing their use of commuter rail, which typically carries commuters longer distances from suburbs to central business districts. In short, we find that the substitutive versus complementary nature of ride-hailing services varies by the location, type, and quality of the transit service in question.\nRecent research on New York City finds that travel has shifted away from public transit towards ride-hailing. So while many suggest that ride-hailing can be complementary to public transit by making it easier to get to and from transit stops and stations, there is mounting evidence that ride-hailing is pulling more people away from public transit than towards it.\nHow might the introduction and increased use of automated vehicles affect public transit use and driving? Simulations that consider whether shared automated vehicles will replace public transit services have found that total vehicle travel increases moderately-to-substantially if shared-ride automated vehicles substitute for transit use: a 6-percent increase if buses are replaced, and an 89-percent increase if high-capacity transit, like urban rail, is replaced. These simulations assume existing levels of travel demand, but most transportation economists assume that the per capita demand for travel will increase with widespread adoption of fully automated vehicles. Why more vehicle travel? Some people previously unable to drive because of age or disability could now do so, others might find riding rather than driving less onerous, and so on.\nRide-hailing and mode substitution\nIn our survey, we asked ride-hailing users which transportation modes they would have used for the trips they currently make using Uber and Lyft (Figure 3). The majority of respondents said that they would have traveled by walking, biking, or public transit, or would not have made the trip at all, while nearly four in 10 (39 percent) reported that they would have traveled by car (either by driving alone, carpooling, or taking a taxi). Using data unadjusted by frequency of ride-hailing use, about half (49 percent) of ride-hailing trips were likely to have been made by walking, biking, or public transit, or not been made at all.\nFigure 3. Likely travel mode used if Uber/Lyft were not available for last trip\n\nThis new evidence of mode substitution suggests that ride-hailing is likely increasing vehicle travel in major cities, though to date by relatively small amounts. The 61 percent of Uber and Lyft trips that would have been made by walking, biking, or transit, or not been made at all are adding vehicles to the road. In addition, ride-hailing raises the concern of deadheading miles, or miles traveled without passengers, which have previously been estimated at 20 to 50 percent of ride-hailing miles. With deadheading miles included, the vehicle travel associated with a ride-hailing trip is potentially higher than if taken in a personal vehicle.\nWhile these data provide initial insights into the travel behavior changes associated with ride-hailing, they only represent a snapshot of representative data from a sample of large cities in late 2015 to early 2016. Continued research in this area is needed to help cities and transportation planners make critical policy decisions such when and where to invest in public transit infrastructure, and whether and when to price or subsidize private mobility services in order to manage travel demand.\nConclusions and policy recommendations\nGiven the rapid growth of private mobility services, it is critical to collect data on their potential impacts on travel behavior, including vehicle ownership, vehicle miles traveled, and travel mode. Further research is needed to understand how ride-hailing will influence future traffic volumes and associated emissions so that cities can effectively manage roads, vehicles, and travel. Absent these data, cities and transit agencies are in the dark when making important decisions that influence how citizens move in their regions. Accordingly, I recommend the following to ensure that the continued growth of private mobility services leads to better urban transportation.\nPricing and/or priority to improve the flow of high-occupancy vehicles\nIn the near term, policymakers need to address the additional vehicle miles that ride-hailing services contribute to cities. Given limited road infrastructure and expanding urban populations, high-occupancy vehicles need to have priority rights-of-way. Both congestion pricing (of all vehicles, including the majority, which are still personally driven) and bus priority lanes (to allow buses to bypass traffic, making transit faster and more attractive) can serve as effective measures to ensure that scarce roadway space is used effectively.\nImproving data access for cities and transportation planners\nThere is an increasing data gap between privatized mobility operators and those in the public sphere who make critical transportation planning and policy decisions. As private mobility providers continue to rapidly expand, they gather massive amounts of data about how people move in cities – data that, for the most part, are unavailable to transportation planners or policymakers. Limited data in the public sector perpetuate less-informed decision-making, which in turn can result in transportation systems that may not meet the public’s needs.\nThere are two potential solutions for bridging the data gap. First, the public sector can and should mandate data-sharing for new mobility operators like Uber and Lyft that travel on public streets and roads. The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission adopted regulations requiring ride-hail companies to share detailed data on rides in New York City. Provided they are sufficiently anonymized, and that cities have put in place clear policies and infrastructure to responsibly safeguard it, this type of data is essential for informed transportation decision-making. Regulators and planners can reasonably require the data because mobility operators rely on publicly funded infrastructure.\nSecond, the public sector can invest in more frequent data-collection efforts. While research that harnesses data from ride-hailing providers themselves may shed light on the utilization, demographics, and miles traveled of these services, the more complex decisions that individuals and households make about where to live, work, and how to get around require continued data-collection efforts through representative samples of the population. Given the pace of innovation in the transportation sector, the current pace of occasional data collection and travel analysis efforts are insufficient.\nRide-hailing services have disrupted traditional transportation providers, including public transit operators. The expansion of ride-hailing has highlighted a number of opportunities for cities to harness new technologies, data, and business models that can serve a greater portion of the population more effectively. While the introduction of private mobility services has brought about welcome innovation in the transportation sector and higher levels of mobility for many travelers, better collaboration between the public sector and these private service providers are required to ensure that these services can be effectively woven into the fabric of cities in ways that are sustainable, equitable, and safe.\n\n This article is adapted from Clewlow, R.
