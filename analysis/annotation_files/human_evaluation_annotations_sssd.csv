Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia’s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He’s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla\'s Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla\'s Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla\'s Volatility, along with its competitors\' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap.

All currency related amount are indicated in the company\'s associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\xa0\xa0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It’s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security’s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security\'s price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security\'s price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla\'s Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

This was in direct response to the Bank of Japan hiking interest rates. The interest rate hikes wiped out trillions of dollars worth of market capitalization across big tech. However, Tesla stock’s share price has since recovered, gaining 8.04% over the past five days.\nI have taken a definitively bullish stance on companies like TSLA due to the falling volatility in the market. The sharp sell-off was characteristically fueled by panic. And many market bargains are ready to be scooped up by investors during this volatile time period.\nI give Tesla stock a buy rating due to its projected earnings and revenue increases that are on the horizon. Also, I’ll delineate a sell case for Tesla stock. This will provide a balanced view of the firm’s opportunities and risks in the market.\nTesla’s Cyclical Wobbles and New Models\nDespite Tesla’s “difficult environment,” the company actually managed to exceed my expectations for its recent quarterly results in some cases. Therefore, I take a contrarian stance with Tesla stock. Many factors were cyclically affecting other electric vehicle (EV stocks) too. This includes a lack of semiconductor chips from firms such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The firm still managed to beat analyst expectations and achieve record quarterly revenues of $25.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year (YOY). However, it’s also true that its earnings fell 43% to 52 cents per share. Therefore, it missed analyst expectations by a wide margin.\nWhere my contrarian case takes hold is in Tesla’s plans for new vehicles. That includes more affordable models such as its $25,000 entry-level Redwood model. It remains on track for production in the first half of 2025. Over time, Tesla’s market share has come under attack by far cheaper Chinese-made EVs. Autos produced by Byd Company (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) currently dominate the Asian market. Yet, consider the 10,000 vehicle production target for TSLA’s Redwood model. Additionally, the company expects profitability for its Cybertruck near the end of the year. These factors shape Tesla into a position of strong recovery. Also, it provides more equal footing with its budget competitor.\nBullish Technical Momentum\nWhile Tesla stock might have disappointed the market with its earnings, I see several indicators pointing to bullish momentum in the short term. And this is evidenced by strong signs in the options market for Tesla’s put and call contracts. Particularly important is the open interest for the August 16 expiration, which is this Friday. The put/call open interest ratio is 0.61, showing significantly more open interest in calls compared to puts. The implied volatility of 6.45% may suggest that investors will be in for a much smoother ride this week compared to previous ones, largely in part of the VIX falling 62.23% over the past five days.\nAnother bullish signal is that after Tesla stock dipped into oversold territory on August 7, momentum has steadily risen over the past trading session. Also, investors can find underlying strength in terms of volume. This could potentially signal a bullish reversal in the near future. However, relatively little interest is being shown TSLA by bulls or bears. So, I see a gradual upward climb for Tesla stock as opposed to violent swings in its valuation.\nReasons to Sell\nDespite my bullishness of Tesla’s prospects, a compelling sell case can be made from Tesla bears. Investorplace author Faizan Farooque recently wrote that the company’s aggressive price cuts have led to shrinking profit margins. And gross margins dropped from 23.8% to 17.6%, and operating margin fell from 16% to 8.2%.\nAdditionally, I believe that due to the persistent undercutting by Chinese EV makers and Tesla’s efforts to keep up, it is undergoing a bit of an identity crisis. For some, Tesla stock is synonymous with American-made quality (and luxurious) EV vehicles.\nTo me, an appeal to Tesla is its luxury and high technology, but as the features of EVs become more commoditized over time, there could be less differentiating features across EVs as a whole to make a specific Tesla model stand out and justify the higher price tag. So, Tesla must create its own edge in the market and not become another me-too brand. Otherwise, it becomes a race to the bottom, and that’s not a competition that Tesla will ever win against its Chinese competitors.\nHowever, I maintain my buy rating for Tesla stock as it adapts to the nascent EV market. It might no longer be considered a high-end vehicle in the future. Yet, its R&D efforts can put it on the bleeding edge of the most modern vehicles. This is especially true for its cars that rest in the higher tiers such as the Cybertruck. These polarizing and unique designs may be a hint of what we can expect from the company in the future.\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses – Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures – Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program – Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities – Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt – Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount – Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption ""Risk Factors"" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\xa01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\xa030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\xa030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled ""Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data"" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\xa030, 2024 using the prior year\'s monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results"" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

"[""Knowledge\n\n\r\n\t\t\t\tThe Top 5 Trends for Defence in 2024\r\n\t\t\t\nGreat challenges will bring huge opportunities in 2024, as the defence and aerospace industry seeks to rise to a diverse range of hurdles. Amid these headwinds, Defence Engage looks at the trends which could come to characterise 2024, from battling skills shortages to pivotal digitalisation efforts.\nMarked by ongoing conflicts in Israel-Palestine and Ukraine, 2024 will see ongoing tensions with China and Iran which pose significant threats to the international order. Geopolitical concerns aside, the industry grapples with supply chain issues, talent shortages, operational risks, and rising costs amid inflation. In the biggest global election year in history we could see significant strategic changes from key players such as the USA, UK, India, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Russia. Here are the five key trends likely to dominate 2024…\n\xa0\n#1 AI and digitalisation efforts to bring security and efficiencies\nThe defence industry faces challenges in rapidly adopting new defensive systems and procedures to keep up with adversaries' technological innovations. From upgrading aging software to mitigate cyber threats, to expanding access to, and the adoption of, key cyber credentials, keeping up with digital trends remains pivotal. Meanwhile, governments are prioritising bringing AI to maturity while ensuring its development is safe and responsible. The rapid adoption of AI, spurred by recent advancements like Chat-GPT, is underway in industry, and indeed OpenAI has already started the year by easing its stance on the use of ChatGPT for military purposes.\nThe impact of AI for defence is forecast to be significant, from helping front-line users detect threats to activating cyber defences faster and with greater agility. Additionally, the integration of AI into defence supply chains could improve platform and parts delivery efficiency, reducing delays and costs, whilst improving security. Meanwhile, digital twins, coupled with machine learning, can enhance visibility of supply chain problems or complexities. According to a BAE report, 86% of defence and aerospace decision makers say their nation has adopted AI for defence applications, so the technology is set to become increasingly mature in 2024.\n\xa0\n#2 Decarbonisation initiatives continue\nFollowing recent data which indicates that 2023 was the hottest year ever, the impetus behind decarbonisation efforts sees renewed urgency. The contribution of the global defence industry to carbon emissions has come under a microscope, with some having suggested that the sector had been overlooked, but there have been some major decarbonisation initiatives, including the establishment of NATO’s Centre of Excellence for Climate Change and the UK’s Sustainable Support Strategy.\nThe impact of climate change upon defence goes beyond the weight of its own contributions, with both the UN and NATO describing climate change as a ‘threat multiplier’, alluding to the destabilising impact climate can have on societies and economies. Industry is rising to meet the challenge, with innovations such as new power solutions or increased circularity in manufacturing. \xa0Last year the EU signalled its intention for defence supply chains to become more sustainable, alongside developing more localised energy in a drive for logistical resilience. Individual initiatives such as the Royal Air Force’s first use of sustainable aviation fuel in a fighter aircraft are lighting the way towards a greener, more sustainable, military.\n\xa0\n#3 Recruitment challenges to persist\nDefence is facing significant challenges when it comes to acquiring talent, skills and retention, from front-line military roles to cyber, quantum and manufacturing. In recent weeks the UK’s Royal Navy has seen significant problems with hiring, at a critical time for the force, with ships being deployed to the Red Sea to counter Houthi Rebels. Last month, the Times reported that Armed forces and defence companies are locked in ‘a war for talent’.\nDwindling forces are due to the lack of recruits for basic training, a lack of digital skills, and the pull of incentives given by neighbouring sectors. The EU and US have recently signalled their plans to try and combat personnel shortages in key areas. The US’ new Defence Industrial Strategy, cites ‘workforce readiness’ as a key strategic focus, with a desire to develop a ‘sufficiently skilled and staffed workforce’. Meanwhile, the European Commission expects skills shortages to increase into the future, with defence urgently requiring skills and talent acquisition, as procurement organisations seek to develop and manage emerging disruptive technologies.\n\xa0\n#4 Agile supply chains to be prioritised\nThe scramble to arm Ukraine and Donald Trump’s trade war with China have highlighted US and allied supply chain vulnerabilities. The last couple of years have seen efforts to build a more resilient supply chain. The US CHIPS act and the EU CHIPS Act designed to securitise semiconductor supply, the European Defence Agency has set out to ensure ‘security of supply’ across the EU, and at the start of 2024, the US’ Defence Industrial Strategy took aim at supply chain fragility, seeking to make it more sustainable alongside more flexible acquisition processes.\n2024 will see more emphasis on agile supply chains: increasing pressure to move away from lengthy procurement processes that cannot react quickly enough or where the end product could be outdated by the time it comes into service. There will be a race to secure and effect easy access to increasingly scarce resources such as minerals driven by the appetite for batteries and the move away from fossil fuels. The surge of additive manufacturing creates a ‘just in time’ supply option, while new military tactics such as the use of drones and increasing need for cyber security will continue to push military to commercial and more readily available solutions.\n\xa0\n#5 Alliances and collaboration lead development and procurement\nCollaborative development programmes such as the sixth-generation fighter efforts: Tempest (by Italy, Japan and the UK) and FCAS (by France, Germany and Spain), are key initiatives designed to combine the best of each nation’s domestic capabilities and combat declining resources. Meanwhile, the AUKUS programme demonstrates how two established nuclear navies (UK and US) are aiding Australia in bolstering Indo-Pacific security. Furthermore, NATO’s Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA), which opened its doors with three innovation challenges in 2023, has established test centres and accelerator units across Europe and North America. The collaboration of NATO members is nothing new, but this more centralised effort to progress on emerging disruptive technologies is hoped to go from strength to strength in 2024.\nGroup-purchases have become increasingly common amongst NATO allies in recent years, with a marked increase since the war in Ukraine began. Just two weeks ago, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and Spain agreed to jointly purchase $5.5 billion worth of Patriot missiles following their effective use observed in Ukraine. Additionally, the research opportunities posed by the war in Ukraine have seen allies and industry testing experimental tech in partnership with Ukrainian soldiers, helping speed up development initiatives, particularly for drones. Following on from the big trend of multi-domain integration, Defence Engage expects multi-national development, purchases and bids to strengthen regional military power and aid embattled allies such as Israel and Ukraine, to continue in 2024 amid ongoing geopolitical upheaval.\n\xa0\nKeep ahead of the trends\nDefence Engage connects suppliers and buyers to help make defence accessible, follow us on LinkedIn or register for our weekly Defence Contracts Digest to stay apprised of new solutions and collaboration opportunities this year.\nWant to discover more about how Defence Engage can enhance your lead-gen efforts and boost your discoverability in Defence?

Through the end of October, FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has approved 38 new drugs. Which companies \xa0and products have made the cut, and which may be best poised for market success?\nBy Patricia Van Arnum, Editorial Director, DCAT, pvanarnum@dcat.org\nNew drug approvals thus far in 2024Although not following a strictly chronological path, examining the pace of new drug approvals is an important measure of product innovation in the bio/pharma industry. Through the end of October (as of October 31, 2024), the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) had approved 38 new molecular entities (NMEs) and biological therapeutics, compared to 46 new drugs approved through October 2023.\nLast year (2023) saw an uptick in new drug approvals compared to 2022, which was a recent dip in new drug approvals. In 2023, FDA’s CDER approved 55 NMEs and new biological therapeutics, a 49% increase in the number of new drug approvals compared to 2022, when 37 new drugs were approved. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 by FDA’s CDER was in line with recent years. In 2021, 50 NMEs and new biological therapeutics were approved and 53 in 2020. The 55 new drugs approved in 2023 represented the second highest level of approvals in the past decade, except for 2018 when 59 new drugs were approved (see Figure 1).\nSmall molecules versus biologicsAnother important trend to look at is the product mix of new drug approvals. Of the 38 new drug approvals thus far in 2024 (as of October 31, 2024), 26, or 68%, were small molecules (24 drugs and two diagnostic/imaging agents), and 12, or 32%, were biologics. That is on par with the mix in 2023, when FDA’s CDER approved 17 new biological therapeutics, which represented 31% of new drug approvals, and 38 small-molecule products or 69% of new drug approvals (see Figure 2).\nThe percentage of small-molecule approvals in 2023 was in line with recent years, except in 2022, which represented a recent low. In 2022, 59% of the new drug approvals by FDA’s CDER were small molecules or 22 of the 37 new drug approved. Between 2018 and 2021, small molecules averaged 74% of new drug approvals. In 2021, small molecules represented 72% of new drug approvals, 75% in 2020,\xa0 79% in 2019, and 71% in 2018.\nThe decrease in small molecules’ share of new drug approvals in 2022 was largely due to the overall decline in new drug approvals in 2022 and a corresponding decline in small-molecule drug approvals and a rise in new biologic drug approvals. In 2022, FDA’s CDER approved 22 new small-molecule drugs and 15 new biologics. The 17 new biologics approved in 2023 surpassed 2022 levels and matched a recent high in 2018, when 17 new biologics were approved by FDA’s CDER, far exceeding biologic approvals of 14 in 2021, 13 in 2020, and 10 in 2019.\nLarge bio/pharma companies versus mid-tier/small companiesThe quantity of new drug approvals, alone, is not a singular measure of product innovation, but tracking it show some interesting trends, notably the increasing contribution of small bio/pharma companies, particularly in the small-molecule drug space. \xa0\nOf the 38 new drugs approved thus far in 2024, 13, or 34%, were from large companies (defined as the top 25 bio/pharma companies based on 2023 revenues and one large medical technology company with approval of a diagnostic agent), and 25, or 66%, were from mid-sized or small companies. In looking at product mix, biologics accounted for more than half (54%) of new drug approvals by the large companies, but only 20% from mid-sized-to-small companies.\nThe large bio/pharma companies have had seven new biological therapeutics approved thus far in 2024 and five small-molecule drugs. For purposes of this analysis, new biological therapeutics only include those approved by FDA’s CDER, which reviews and approves new molecular entities and new biological therapeutics. Other biologic-based products, including blood products, vaccines, allergenics, tissues, and cellular and gene therapies, are reviewed and approved by a separate center within FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER).\nSo which companies made the cut in biologics? The seven biologics approved from the large bio/pharma companies were: Amgen’s Imdelltra (tarlatamab-dlle) for treating extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; Astellas’ Vyloy (zolbetuximab-clzb) for treating gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, a rare type of cancer of the esophagus; Eli Lilly and Company’s Ebglyss (lebrikizumab-lbkz) for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema); Lilly’s Kisunla (donanemab-azbt) for treating early symptomatic Alzheimer’s disease;\xa0 Merck & Co.’s Winrevair (sotatercept-csrk) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare disease in which blood vessels in the lungs thicken and narrow, causing strain on the heart; \xa0Pfizer’s Hympavzi (marstacimab-hncq) for preventing or reducing bleeding episodes related to hemophilia A or B; and Roche’s Piasky (crovalimab-akkz) for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), a rare blood disorder.\nThe five small-molecule drug approvals from the large bio/pharmaceutical companies were: AstraZeneca’s Voydeya (danicopan) for treating extravascular hemolysis with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, a rare blood disease; Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Cobenfy (xanomeline and trospium chloride) for treating schizophrenia; Gilead Sciences’ Livdelzi (seladelpar) for treating primary biliary cholangitis, a chronic autoimmune disease that damages the liver’s bile ducts, causing a buildup of bile and toxins;\xa0 Johnson & Johnson’s Lazcluze (lazertinib) for treating non-small cell lung cancer; Roche’s Itovebi (inavolisib) for treating locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. In addition, GE Healthcare gained FDA approval for Flyrcado (flurpiridaz F 18), a radioactive diagnostic drug to evaluate for myocardial ischemia and infarction.\nMid-tier & small bio/pharma companies: new drug approvalsSmall-molecules by far dominated new approvals from mid-sized to small companies, with many of the drugs indicated for rare diseases. Below is a roundup of small-molecule drug approvals from mid-sized and small companies thus far this year (as of October 31, 2024):\nOn the biologics side, small-to-mid-sized bio/pharma companies have had five biologics approved thus far in 2024. These are: BeiGene’s Tevimbra (tislelizumab-jsgr) for treating unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer; Galderma’s Nemluvio\xa0(nemolizumab-ilto) for treating prurigo nodularis, a chronic skin disorder with itchy nodules; Hugel-Aesthetics’ Letybo (letibotulinumtoxinA-wlbg) for temporarily improving the appearance of moderate-to-severe glabellar lines (i.e., so-called “frown lines”); ImmunityBio’s Anktiva (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln) for treating bladder cancer; and Incyte’s Niktimvo (axatilimab-csfr) for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease.\n\n\nBio/Pharma’s Rising Stars: The Companies Emerging on the Industry’s Radar\nA Shortage of Inspectors Curtailing FDA Inspections: The Impact on Pharma\nA Look Ahead: Bio/Pharma’s Top Policy Issues in US Elections Aftermath\nA Strong Contract ADC Market Drives Expansions in High-Potency Manufacturing\nOne Washington Blvd., Suite 6\nRobbinsville, NJ 08691, USA\n+1-609-208-1888\nToll Free: +1-800-640-DCAT (3288)\n© 2024 DCAT | Privacy Policy\nDCAT Value Chain Insights is produced by the Drug, Chemical &\nAssociated Technologies Association, a not-for-profit business\ndevelopment association for companies engaged in the global bio/pharmaceutical manufacturing value chain.

Why has the society not made faster progress on cancer front? Why do discoveries in biotechnology sector occur in fits and spurts? We claim that this slow and sporadic progress has a lot to do with the vagaries of capital markets. Letâ\x80\x99s begin with a success story. There is little doubt that BioNTech (Pfizer), Moderna, and AstraZeneca vaccines had a profound impact on the developed worldâ\x80\x99s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Without them, countless more lives and trillions of dollars of economic value would have been further lost. The stock prices of these companies reached dramatic peaks after the world learned about their success. However, as of this week, they have already shed 50% of their peak market values, while we are still in the midst of the pandemic. This rapid rise and fall of these biotechnology stocks is not just about the Covid-vaccine stocks but also about the fortunes of the biotechnology sector as a whole. We describe this roller-coaster phenomenon in this post and claim that this phenomenon is not healthy for the society, particularly given the aging population and increasing need for new healthcare solutions.\n â\x80\x9cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnologyâ\x80\x9d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\n\n\nâ\x80\x9cResponding to a Potentially Disruptive Technology: How Big Pharma Embraced Biotechnologyâ\x80\x9d by Julian Birkinshaw, Ivanka Visnjic, & Simon Best. (Vol. 60/4) 2018.\nContrary to popular beliefs, most of the new drugs or vaccines are not discovered by big pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer or Merck. The development chain of a new life-science product can be divided into several phases: synthesis (discovery of a molecule or formulation), initial research (preclinical tests in lab and trials on animals), and development (human trials). The initial steps are typically taken by individual scientists, biotechnology start-ups, and research labs of universities. Those early-stage discoveries, their patents, or the discovering companies themselves, are then bought by the big pharmaceutical companies. The later steps in the development chain require numerous approvals from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is numerous long and costly processes, that can only be done by big pharma. The next steps after FDA approval can also be undertaken only by big pharma: creation of brands through massive advertising campaigns, putting and scaling up manufacturing capabilities, and distribution of drugs using extensive vendor network. Small companies can try, but the likelihood of success is low given their lack of experience and capabilities in these areas. For example, Novavax is yet to be launched in the US, despite a claim that is it a better vaccine than the currently available ones.\nConsider two of Pfizerâ\x80\x99s largest drugs from before Covid period: Pregabalin (Lyrica) and Palbociclib (Ibrance). They were discovered by Northwestern University and Onyx Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Similarly, Johnson & Johnsonâ\x80\x99s blockbuster product, infliximab (Remicade), was synthesized at New York University in collaboration with a small biotechnology company Centocor. More recently, BioNTechâ\x80\x99s synthesized the Covid Vaccine. It then entered into a collaboration agreement with Pfizer to â\x80\x9cleverage Pfizerâ\x80\x99s broad expertise in vaccine research and development, regulatory capabilities, and global manufacturing and distribution network.â\x80\x9d Biohaven, a small biotech company, relied on Pfizer for the commercialization of its migraine drug Rimegepant.\nIt must be clear from the above discussion that small biotech firms or research labs play the foundational role in innovation of drugs and vaccines. That innovation must benefit the society, evident from the progress in healthcare, physical well being, and increasing longevity of human beings over the last century. Yet, synthesis and discovery are not straightforward activities. Behind each successful product lie millions of research hours and thousands of synthesized products that never see the light of the day. Out of thousands of synthesized molecules, only few reach what is called Phase 1 success, and just 10% of those receive FDA approval. Even after FDA approval, only a few products are launched in the market, because a launching firm must reassess market potential before spending additional billions of dollars in creating manufacturing, branding, and distribution network. So, only a few start-ups, even among those that successfully synthesized products, are finally rewarded by big pharma. Why would a small company, or a group of scientists and doctors, devote their precious time, give up their careers, and spend their meager resources to develop something that has less than a lottery like chance to succeed? The answer is lottery like payoffs.\nLetâ\x80\x99s consider a few examples. From market value of just $5 billion at the end of 2018, Moderna reached a valuation of $181 billion dollars in Sept 2021.Â\xa0 BioNTech, which got listed in October 2019, reached a peak value of $108 billion in Aug 2021. This phenomenon is not just about Covid vaccines. Axsome Therapeutics, which traded for just $2 per share by the end of 2018, reached $108 dollars by the end of 2019. More important, big pharma pays large premiums to acquire listed companies and unlisted start-ups. For example, in 2017, Gilead acquired a small biotech Kite Pharma, for $11.9 billion, and in 2020, Bayer acquired Asklepios, a gene-therapy startup, for a total cost of $4 billion. Acquisition by Big Pharma is typically the endgame for most biotech start-ups.\nBut the efforts and cost spent on drug development, after adjusting for inflation, keep doubling every nine years. This phenomenon is described in Eroomâ\x80\x99s law. (For curious people, Eroom is opposite of Mooreâ\x80\x99s law, which describes the decreasing costs of discovering new products in electronics.) Given the rising costs, only rising lottery payoffs can keep up the incentives for small biotechnology start-ups to bet it all on their ventures. Indeed, announcement of each new multibillion dollar acquisition lifts both valuations and innovation efforts across the industry.\nHowever, the purpose of this post is not to describe that small, biotechnology firms have lottery like payoffs, but to emphasize that any drop in lottery type payoffs could have an opposite impact on the society. The valuations of biotechnology companies have recently declined rather rapidly. Modernaâ\x80\x99s valuation is down to $64 billion and BioNTechâ\x80\x99s valuation is down to $38 billion, both more than 50% off their recent peaks. And it is not just about a few, isolated stocks. Diversified funds, that invest in hundreds of biotechnology stocks, are also off their recent peaks. For example, XBI, an S&P Exchange Traded Fund investing in biotechnology companies, is down 50% of its peak in less than twelve months. Neither the tech-heavy Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 index have declined by that much over the past one year, on the contrary, both have increased.\nWhy should one worry about sudden decline in valuations of biotechnology firms, or the vagaries in their fortunes? Well, they have a real impact on the society because an elaborate system of multi-stage and risky financing drives new drug discovery. Letâ\x80\x99s consider this chain of thought. Now big pharma would pay a lower price for successful innovation, and a successful biotech firm now has a lower chance of doing the initial public offering or being acquired at an astounding price. Lowering of lottery like payoffs, in conjunction with the rising costs of discoveries, means that venture capitalists would pull out investments from risky biotech projects and doctors and researchers will spend less hours in synthesizing new drugs. Importantly, some promising research would not progress further, and their discoveries would be prematurely lost. Thus, the roller coaster in the fortunes of biotechnology sector now means lower chance of developing new drugs and vaccines, as well as loss of promising research effort. This is not just like putting off another steel plant, which can increase the steel prices, and increase the costs of automobiles. Not discovering a drug or a vaccine means prolonged illness, pain, or even more deaths. It may sound macabre, but fluctuating stock market fortunes of biotech firms would impact the health and wellbeing of citizens, something that personally touches us all, even if we donâ\x80\x99t invest in stock markets.\nIn sum, the rapid rise and fall of biotechnology sector adversely impact society. How to solve this problem? One proposed solution by MITâ\x80\x99s Andrew Lo, is to pool the risks of multiple cancer projects and fund it using a superfund. We strongly endorse this idea. However, it is unclear how a superfund can better allocate seed capital to individual small projects than can capital markets or venture funds which are known for their speed and efficiency. Another idea is that such important research should not be left to private ventures but should instead be done by government sponsored and not-for-profit research institutions. Indeed, health-sector research is the largest avenue for government R&D funding, sponsored through National Institute of Health. Recall that government research funding was instrumental in development of Covid vaccines. Furthermore, the benefits from public R&D spill over to many more public and private projects that do benefit from private R&D. This point is enforced by President Bidenâ\x80\x99s recent announcement on cancer research.Â\xa0\nThe key takeaway from this post is that there is a need for a new model to fund grassroot research in biotechnology sector. On one hand, the current model, based on venture funding, unleashes entrepreneurial energies and efforts, and attracts the best talent to biotechnology sector. On the other hand, the vagaries of biotechnology stocks in capital markets lead to fits and starts in biotechnology discoveries and cause frequent loss of promising research. Society must find a happy balance between the two forces and find a new way to address this problem, a problem that cannot be simply left to free markets.\n\n   Volume 66, Issue 4\n   Summer 2024\n   \nTo Be or Not to Be: Will Virtual Worlds and the Metaverse Gain Lasting Traction?\nThe Metaverse Flywheel: Creating Value across Physical and Virtual Worlds\nThe Diffusion of the Metaverse: How YouTube Influencers Shape Mass Adoption\nMetaverse Management as Urban Planning: Lessons from Paradise (Nevada)\nGreen Innovation Games\nCalifornia Management Review\nBerkeley-Haas's Premier Management Journal\nPublished at Berkeley Haas for more than sixty years, California Management Review seeks to share knowledge that challenges convention and shows a better way of doing business.\nHaas School of Business\n                University of California, Berkeley\nCalifornia Management Review\n                F465 Berkeley Haas School of Business\n\t\t\t\t2220 Piedmont Ave. Berkeley, CA 94720-1900\n\t\t\t\t(510) 725-7826 |\n\t\t\t\tcmr@haas.berkeley.edu\nCopyright Â© 2024 UC Regents | UC Berkeley | Privacy Policy\n""]","In October 2024, the FDA approved a certain number of new drugs, of which a specific portion were biologics.

Amarin Corp (AMRN) saw their stock price triple after their drug Vascepa succeeded in a large Phase III study.\nThe largest moves tend to happen when most investors aren\'t paying much attention, and that could be the setup for a newer neuro company that recently made their way to the public markets. NeuroOne Medical Technologies (NMTC) is a small developer of electrode technology that just quietly submitted their first product to the U.S. FDA for a possible clearance early in 2019. NeuroOne\'s technologies - sometimes known as \'\'neurostimulation\'\' devices - have been tested at the Mayo Clinic, which is also a 10% owner of the company\'s public stock. Now that the company is headed towards their first possible FDA clearance, and with a second possible clearance for another device right on its heels, NMTC is a healthcare company to be aware of before it gets discovered.\nNeuroOne Operates In An $8B And Growing Device Market\nThe emerging field of neurostimulation refers to technologies that electrically stimulate or monitor the nervous system to treat and diagnose disorders. Though humans have learned much about the nervous system in the last twenty years, it remains a mysterious organ and technology has only recently begun to unlock some new treatment options. These devices are now helping in a variety of difficult neurological disorders, like Parkinson\'s Disease, Dystonia, Epilepsy and even in the treatment of pain and some nerve damage.\nIt\'s an exciting time as this industry takes off. In 2019 the research firm Global Markets Insights expect this to be a $8.196 billion industry across the globe, and $6.5 billion in North America and Europe alone.\nOne of the earliest successes for neurostimulation devices was in Epilepsy and Parkinson\'s using Deep Brain Stimulation, or DBS and ablation. After identifying brain tissue that may be causing Epileptic seizures or movement problems as in severe Parkinson\'s, neurologists can selectively modulate or destroy this tissue with a DBS or ablation device, reducing or sometimes eliminating symptoms of the disorder. In fact, ablation can cure about 50% of Epileptic patients.\nThe hangup for many Parkinson\'s, Dystonia, or Epilepsy patients who are eligible for DBS or ablation is the traumatic surgical requirements, not only for treatment but also to diagnose and pinpoint the affecting brain tissue. It can take weeks in the hospital, sometimes with wires protruding from a patient\'s skull!\nHere\'s where NeuroOne hopes to make its mark on the industry. The company\'s initial devices are high-fidelity electrodes designed to enhance and possibly shorten this diagnostic/treatment process. These thin-film electrodes, used in a procedure called an EEG (electroencephalogram), may provide more accurate detection of irregular brain activity over currently available technology. In limited clinical testing so far, doctors at the Mayo Clinic have been able to document pre-seizure activity (called micro-seizures) during clinical research with their patients using NeuroOne\'s technology. The electrodes are being developed as strips and depth electrodes, and they\'ve already demonstrated an improvement in inflammatory response compared to existing products when used on some brain tissue. With better diagnostic process, NeuroOne hopes that their products can shorten the diagnostic time and improve safey for Epileptics and patients suffering from movement disorders.\nCombined, this first technology addresses a demand for improved diagnostic options among neurologists, and NeuroOne is now racing to market with their first medical devices for approval.\nNMTC Quietly Made Their First FDA Clearance Application\nNeuroOne has been mostly quiet on the investor front, but in a recent SEC filing they revealed that they filed their first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) application on January 28, 2019. The application covers their cortical and strip electrodes for temporary (less than 30 day) use with recording, monitoring, and acute stimulation equipment for the recording, monitoring and stimulation of electrical signals on the surface of the brain.\nIn the case of this 510(k) process, which is used when the device holds a low risk to the patient, the FDA will aim to complete its review within 90 days of receiving the notification.\nThis is the biggest gating event for NeuroOne since the company went public, and it could take them from a development stage company to commercial and their first revenue. An FDA clearance could launch the into the mainstream of healthcare companies, and investors will undoubtedly take notice of this tiny company.\nThe company also plans to file a FDA 510(k) marketing clearance for their first depth electrode during the second quarter. Following that, they\'re working on a unique diagnostic/ablation device that could further shorten and simplify the treatment time for patients.\nNMTC could have two value-driving events in the next 5-6 months, and the markets are barely paying attention.\nStrong Advisory Board Backs NeuroOne, And Mayo Owns 10% Of The Company\nThe breadth of expertise involved in NeuroOne is impressive. The company has strong advisors and executives, and their technology has been tested over the years by both the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the Mayo Clinic, the latter of which is also a 10% holder of NMTC\'s public stock.\nSince going public, NeuroOne has been building a team of experienced medical tech and neurology advisory members: Mayo Clinic\'s Greg Worrell MD, PhD and Gregory J. Esper, MD, MBA of Emory University both sit on the company\'s scientific advisory board. More recently, Dr. Kip Ludwig, former Program Director for Neural Engineering at the NIH, became chair of the company\'s new ""artificial intelligence"" advisory board, which will focus on deploying NeuroOne\'s electrode technology in artificial intelligence and bioelectronics applications. Dr. Cristin Welle of the Univ. of Colorado joined, a founder of the Neural Interfaces Program at the FDA\'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health Office of Science and Engineering Labs; plus Dr. Doug Weber, a Program Manager in the Biological Technologies Office (BTO) at DARPA.\nEvaluating AI opens up some unique possible opportunities as more researchers have considered the potential for electrode/brain interfaces. The possibility for some kind of translational work in this space is intriguing.\n2019 Should Be A Big Year For NMTC Shareholders\nNeuroOne has been operating in stealth mode for the last year, but 2019 could be when investors start to pay attention. The company will likely have 2 FDA clearances in the next 6 months if the FDA signs off on their cortical and depth electrode 510(k) filings. As this stock has been mostly flat since going public, these events may be the first time that investors stand up and take notice. Additionally, NMTC plans to apply for a listing on the Nasdaq, another catalyst that could create significant value for shareholders if NMTC can qualify. With CEO Dave Rosa\'s successful track record building venture stage healthcare companies, multiple value creating catalysts on the horizon, and an awesome technology with blue sky potential, investors long NMTC could be handsomely rewarded for a patient long position in this relatively unknown healthcare company.\nAbout One Equity Stocks\nOne Equity Stocks is a provider of paid-for research on publicly traded emerging growth companies.

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City’s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City’s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people’s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can “surcharge,” which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the “5-year storm” or the “10-year storm.” The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called “green infrastructure.” Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released “Increasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.” In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall—Hurricanes Henri and Ida—spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement “cloudburst” management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City’s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city’s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term “green infrastructure” refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program “Bluebelts” are developed as components of New York City’s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city’s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A “cloudburst” is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city’s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site’s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City’s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city’s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

Agencies and organizations are working to prepare people as their world changes around them, and NASA information is helping these efforts.\nThe agency’s global data is now available in the sea level section of the Earth Information Center. NASA developed the global sea level change website in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense, the World Bank, the U.S. Department of State, and the United Nations Development Programme. \xa0\nThe site includes information on projected sea level rise through the year 2150 for coastlines around the world, as well as estimates of how much flooding a coastal community or region can expect to see in the next 30 years. The projections come from data collected by NASA and its partners and from computer models of ice sheets and the ocean, as well as the latest sea level assessment from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other sources.\n“NASA innovates for the benefit of humanity. Our cutting-edge instruments and data-driven information tools help communities and organizations respond to natural hazards and extreme weather, and inform critical coastal infrastructure planning decisions,” said Karen St. Germain, director of the Earth science division at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nInformation to Action\nInternational organizations such as the World Bank will use the data from the global sea level change site for tasks including the creation of Climate Risk Profiles for countries especially vulnerable to sea level rise.\nThe Defense Department will continue to incorporate sea level rise data into its plans to anticipate and respond to hazards posed to its facilities by the effects of rising oceans. Similarly, the State Department uses the information for activities ranging from disaster preparedness to long-term adaptation planning to supporting partners around the world in related efforts.\n“We are at a moment of truth in our fight against the climate crisis. The science is unequivocal and must serve as the bedrock upon which decision-making is built. With many communities around the world already facing severe impacts from sea-level rise, this new resource provides a vital tool to help them protect lives and livelihoods. It also illustrates what is at stake between a 1.5-degree-Celsius world and a current-policies trajectory for all coastal communities worldwide,” said Assistant Secretary-General Selwin Hart, special adviser to the United Nations secretary-general on climate action and just transition.\nRising Faster\nNASA-led data analyses have revealed that between 1970 and 2023, 96% of countries with coastlines have experienced sea level rise. The rate of that global rise has also accelerated, more than doubling from 0.08 inches (0.21 centimeters) per year in 1993 to about 0.18 inches (0.45 centimeters) per year in 2023.\nAs the rate of sea level rise increases, millions of people could face the related effects sooner than previously projected, including larger storm surges, more saltwater intrusion into groundwater, and additional high-tide flood days — also known as nuisance floods or sunny day floods.\n“This new platform shows the timing of future floods and the magnitude of rising waters in all coastal countries worldwide, connecting science and physics to impacts on people’s livelihoods and safety,” said Nadya Vinogradova Shiffer, director of the ocean physics program at NASA Headquarters in Washington.\nData released earlier this year found that Pacific Island nations will experience at least 6 inches (15 centimeters) of sea level rise in the next 30 years. The number of high-tide flood days will increase by an order of magnitude for nearly all Pacific Island nations by the 2050s.\n“The data is clear: Sea levels are rising around the world, and they’re rising faster and faster,” said Ben Hamlington, a sea level researcher at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and head of the agency’s sea level change science team. “Having the best information to make decisions about how to plan for rising seas is more crucial than ever.”\nTo explore the global sea level change site:\nhttps://earth.gov/sealevel\nNews Media Contacts\nKaren Fox / Elizabeth VlockNASA Headquarters, Washington202-358-1600karen.c.fox@nasa.gov / elizabeth.a.vlock@nasa.gov\nJane J.

"['Heat Stress on the Great Barrier Reef\nMarch 4, 2024JPEG\nAustralia’s Great Barrier Reef has been hit by widespread coral bleaching caused by heat stress, government officials confirmed on March 8, 2024. This is the fifth mass bleaching of the reef since 2016. \nAerial surveys of over 300 reefs conducted by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which monitors the health of the coral, found bleaching in shallow water areas spanning two-thirds of the reef. \n“The results of the aerial survey and the coral bleaching that we are seeing are consistent with the patterns of heat stress that have been building over the reef over the summer months,” said Roger Beeden, chief scientist at the reef authority. \nThe Great Barrier Reef lies off the northeast coast of Queensland, Australia. It is one of the richest and most biodiverse natural ecosystems on Earth. Spread across 346,000 square kilometers (134,000 square miles) of the Coral Sea, it comprises 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands. \nBleaching events are caused by sustained, warmer-than-average ocean temperatures. Corals have a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae known as zooxanthellae, which provide the coral polyps with nutrients as well as their bright colors. Heat stress causes the corals to expel the zooxanthellae, leaving the skeletal structures with a “bleached” appearance. \nA common metric used to assess the risk to coral reefs from high water temperature is the number of weeks that sea surface temperatures have exceeded the mean monthly maximum temperature by 1 degree Celsius. Significant coral bleaching may occur after 4 weeks of elevated temperatures, and severe, widespread coral bleaching is likely after 8 such weeks. As of early March, parts of the reef had been exposed to between 8 and 10 hotter-than-normal weeks, according to the reef authority. \nThe map above shows sea surface temperature anomalies off the coast of eastern Australia on March 4, 2024. It is based on data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project, an effort by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) that blends measurements of sea surface temperatures from multiple NASA, NOAA, and international satellites, as well as ship and buoy observations. Rather than showing absolute temperature, the anomaly reflects the difference between the sea surface temperature on March 4, 2024, and the 2003-2014 average for that day. \nPrevious mass bleaching events on the reef occurred in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, “Prior to these years, there is no evidence of such widespread events in the Great Barrier Reef’s 500-year coral record history.” \nDuring the latter half of 2023 and beginning of 2024, trade winds in the Pacific Ocean relaxed, allowing warm water from the western Pacific to push into the eastern Pacific—a phenomenon known as El Niño. This pattern, on top of human-caused climate change, has driven global average sea surface temperatures to record highs for the past 10 months. However, the relationship between El Niño and sea surface temperatures off the coast of eastern Australia is a bit more complicated. \n“Sea surface temperatures during El Niño and La Niña events act a bit like a seesaw,” said Josh Willis, a climate scientist at JPL. “When ocean temperatures during an El Niño are higher in the eastern Pacific, they’re typically lower in the western Pacific.” \nResearch has found that patterns in large-scale ocean circulation and climate change alone do not fully explain trends in sea surface temperatures and bleaching in the Coral Sea. Rather, weather patterns during El Niño events have historically suppressed the Australian summer monsoon, resulting in reduced cloud cover and higher-than-average air temperatures. These conditions play a big role in determining temperatures in the Coral Sea and the extent and location of coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef. \nNASA Earth Observatory image by Michala Garrison, using data from the MUR SST (Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature) project and reef information from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA).

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023–2024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short • This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). • Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. • Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. • Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. • Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1–2.5°C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. • The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. • The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 – December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 – January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. • Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. • In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. • Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. • On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% – 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. • On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% – 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. • On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. • The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. • It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. • The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer’s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS’ coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% – 30%, 12 reefs had >30% – 50% cover and four reefs had >50% – 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% – 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA. Central Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cooktown to Proserpine) Surveyed August 2023 to June 2024 Image 2: Variable reef state on the Central GBR. A. Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% – 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% – 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% – 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐ thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% – 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% – 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% – 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% – 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% – 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% –50% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22–11.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% – 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% – 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% – 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does ‘percent hard coral cover’ mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% – 10%, >10% – 30%, >30% – 50%, >50% – 75% and >75% – 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% – 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% – 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% – 10%, b) >10% – 30%, c) >30% – 50% and d) >50% – 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023–2024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths – Shallow (2–5m), Mid (7–9m) and Deep (9–12m) – and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%–50% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0–2 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2–4 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4–6 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6–8 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs. Source: NOAA/NESDIS/STAR Coral Reef Watch program. Coral bleaching prevalence categories: 0 = no bleaching, 1 = low bleaching (<10% of corals), 2 = medium bleaching (>10% – 30%), 3 = high bleaching (>30% – 60%), 4 = very high bleaching (>60% – 90%), 5 = extreme bleaching (>90%). Note that these are the same categories used by LTMP manta tow surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1–9.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2–9.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8– 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2–11.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% – 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% – 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys. Figure 6: Proportion of coral colonies not bleached, partially bleached, fully bleached, or dead across depths from in-water surveys of 36 reefs conducted by the AIMS Bleaching Response team.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4–13.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3–15.6 DHWs – cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9–11.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3–9.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% – 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% – 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the ‘shifting baseline’ syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak ‘wave’ through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring.

Coral cover remains high while impacts of mass coral bleaching yet to be determined ANNUAL SUMMARY REPORT OF THE GREAT BARRIER REEF CORAL REEF CONDITION 2023–2024 Published 7 August 2024 In Short • This report summarises the condition of coral reefs in the Northern, Central and Southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from the Long-Term Monitoring Program (LTMP) surveys of 94 reefs conducted between August 2023 and June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). • Over the past 38 years of monitoring by the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), hard coral cover on reefs of the GBR has decreased and increased in response to cycles of disturbance and recovery. • Percent hard coral cover is one standard measure of reef condition recorded by scientists worldwide, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health and is used in this report. Other important data, such as diversity or composition of coral assemblages, are collected and reported by LTMP in other ways. • Changes in coral cover are qualified with respect to the margin of error, defined by 95% credible intervals (CIs). Credible intervals describe the level of uncertainty in the estimates of hard coral cover. • Above-average water temperatures (i.e. sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1–2.5°C) occurred on the GBR over the austral summer, peaking in March 2024 and resulting in the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016. • The mass coral bleaching on the GBR was part of a global event declared by NOAA and ICRI in April 2024. • The Central GBR was impacted by two tropical cyclones: Cyclone Jasper (Category 5 – December 2023) and Cyclone Kirrily (Category 3 – January 2024). Although Cyclone Jasper was a Category 5 in the Coral Sea, it was only Category 2 when traversing the GBR. • Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) outbreaks have persisted on four Southern GBR reefs, while four reefs of the Northern GBR have low numbers of starfish. • In 2024, hard coral cover has increased across the GBR, but regional hard coral cover remains similar to that reported in 2022 and 2023. Importantly, most surveys were conducted prior to the mass coral bleaching event and passage of two cyclones, and the full impact of these events is yet to be determined. Its also important to note that bleached coral is still recorded as live coral during surveys, and the fate of these corals is not yet known. • Of the 94 reefs surveyed, only two reefs had hard coral cover <10%, 36 reefs had hard coral cover between 10% and 30%, and 35 reefs had coral cover between 30% and 50%. The remaining 21 reefs had hard coral cover between 50% and 75%. • On the Northern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs), a regional high, but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (35.8% average; 32.1% – 39.5% CIs). All surveys were completed prior to the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024. • On the Central GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), a regional high but remained within the margin of error of 2023 (30.7% average; 27.5% – 34.0% CIs). Twenty-three of 39 reefs were surveyed before the peak heat stress which occurred in March 2024, while 17 reefs were surveyed before cyclone impacts. • On the Southern GBR, region-wide average hard coral cover increased to 39.1% (33.7% to 44.5% CIs) from 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) in 2023. Fourteen of 30 reefs were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. • The high coral cover reported this year is good news but does not mean all is fine on the GBR as it continues to face cumulative stressors. 2024 saw the fifth mass coral bleaching event since 2016 with the largest spatial footprint of coral bleaching yet recorded, coupled with the impact of two tropical cyclones. The impacts on coral cover from these events are partially captured in this year's report. A full assessment of changes in coral cover following these disturbances will be recorded during the next survey season. • It is important to note that recent increases in hard coral cover can be quickly undone, as many corals are susceptible to elevated heat stress, wave damage and crown-of-thorns starfish predation, all of which impacted the GBR this year. • The results presented here are our best understanding of reef condition before the impact of summer’s disturbances.

Photo credit: AIMS LTMP Background: Sampling Methods and Analysis With reef surveys extending over 38 years, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Long-Term Monitoring Program provides a unique and invaluable record of change in reef status by repeatedly and consistently surveying coral reef communities on representative reefs across the entire span of the Great Barrier Reef. This annual summary of the status and trends in hard coral cover is derived from manta tow surveys of coral reefs (Figure 1). These surveys are a broadscale technique that covers reef slopes of whole reef perimeters in a short amount of time. More detailed surveys of fish and coral assemblages are also conducted along permanently marked transects on 71 reefs; however, the data from these are still being analysed and undergoing quality assurance and quality checking. They will become available on the online dashboard once completed. Our Monitoring Dashboard presents a synthesis of all AIMS’ coral reef monitoring data across each of the surveyed reefs and at various spatial aggregations (including Natural Resource Management regions and latitudinal sectors). For this annual summary, the GBR Marine Park is divided into three regions (Northern, Central and Southern GBR; Figure 1) that show different trajectories of change in hard coral cover over time. These changes are mostly in response to the cumulative impacts of the main disturbances: severe tropical cyclones, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish and coral bleaching. Since 2016, GBR-wide summaries are no longer displayed, as this spatial resolution oversimplifies the variability of coral cover dynamics. Presentation of patterns for the three regions separately offers an easily interpretable overview without oversimplification or getting lost in the complexity inherent at finer spatial scales (i.e. individual reefs). A total of 94 reefs were surveyed from August 2023 to June 2024 (reported as ‘2024’). Online reports on the status and trends of individual reefs and reefs grouped by latitudinal sectors, including their disturbance history, are available shortly after the completion of each survey trip and quality checking of the data. Data summaries are available for download. The reefs of the GBR are dynamic, and there is considerable variation among regions in the decline and recovery cycles of hard coral cover and community composition in response to disturbances. Understanding these dynamics in the context of the disturbance regimes is critical for the interpretation of the long-term monitoring data. The LTMP provides the longest running, most spatially extensive dataset collected by standard methods on the GBR (see Box 1). The number of reefs able to be surveyed each year is a small portion of the number of reefs found on the GBR (~100 vs 3000). However, the LTMP survey reefs were selected to provide a representative sample across the length and breadth of the GBR that captures multiple geographical and ecological gradients (e.g. latitude and position across the continental shelf) and encapsulates many of the bioregions and all the management zones defined in the 2004 rezoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. AIMS is committed to continuous improvement in the analysis of LTMP data, and recent statistical advances have permitted a refinement of analytical approaches for the type of ecological time series data used in this report. Temporal trends in hard coral cover presented in this report are analysed using Bayesian hierarchical models, and more detail of these analytical methods is presented here. Northern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Cape York to Cooktown) Surveyed November 2023 to February 2024 Image 1: Photos showing the variable state of reefs in the Northern GBR in 2024. A. Low numbers of Crown-of-thorns starfish below outbreak levels were recorded on a number of reefs. B. McSweeney Reef is still in the early stages of recovery from recent disturbances. C & D. Minor bleaching was recorded on several reefs throughout the Northern GBR, such as Swinger Reef and North Direction Island. E. Outer shelf reefs such as Davie Reef have diverse fish and corals. F. Flourishing coral assemblages at Middle Banks. Note that all surveys were conducted before the peak summer heat in March 2024. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. There was substantial variation in the condition of the 25 individual reefs surveyed in the Northern GBR (Figure 1a, Image 1). Nine of 25 reefs had coral cover >10% – 30%, 12 reefs had >30% – 50% cover and four reefs had >50% – 75% cover (Figure 1a). A total of 24 of the 25 Northern GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Of these, six had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b). However, only two were outside the margin of error, and these declines were most likely due to crown-of-thorns starfish predation and coral disease. Region-wide hard coral cover was relatively stable from 1985 to 2010, then declined to the lowest recorded levels in 2017 following cumulative impacts from crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, severe tropical cyclones (STCs Ita and Nathan), and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. There was a period of strong recovery from 2017 to 2022. Hard coral cover has increased further since 2023, from 35.8% (32.1% – 39.5% CIs) to 39.5% (35.0% – 44.0% CIs) in 2024, the highest level since surveys began, but it remains within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 2). Surveys in 2024 found low crown-of-thorns starfish numbers at some reefs in the region (Image 1A), but all reefs were classified as either No COTS or No Outbreak (Figure 1c). Additionally, COTS feeding scars were observed on 14 reefs, indicating the presence of low numbers of starfish. Northern GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP experienced accumulated heat stress between 3.64 and 8.73 DHWs1 during peak heat accumulation in March 2024. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted from November 2023 to February 2024 before the height of summer; however, low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) (Figure 1d, Image 1C,D). No bleaching was observed on the remaining seven reefs (Figure 1d). We discuss the severity and spatial extent of the 2024 mass coral bleaching event in more detail below. Figure 2: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Northern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 129 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 25 reefs were surveyed in 2024. Note that many reefs in this region were surveyed before the peak heat stress occurred in March 2024. 1 DHWs (degree heating weeks) expresses the accumulated heat stress over the previous three months by adding up the time when temperature exceeds the bleaching threshold. Significant coral bleaching is predicted above 4 DHWs and coral mortality is expected above 8 DHWs. Further information available from NOAA.

Storm damage from Cyclone Kirrily on Kelso Reef. B. Coral assemblages were patchy at Beaver Reef. C. High coral cover but medium bleaching (10% – 30% of corals) at Slate Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays D. Bleaching at Chicken Reef, on the outer shelf off Townsville. E. Flourishing coral gardens on the back reef of Agincourt Reef No. 1 offshore from Port Douglas. F. Coral cover has increased rapidly at Hyde Reef on the outer shelf off the Whitsundays. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. The status of the reefs in the Central GBR was variable in 2024. Of the 39 reefs surveyed, two reefs had <10% hard coral cover; 18 had hard coral cover >10% – 30%, 14 reefs had hard coral cover >30% – 50%, and five had hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a, Image 2). A total of 30 of the 39 Central GBR reefs surveyed in 2024 had been previously surveyed within the past two years. Thirteen of these reefs had lower hard coral cover than in the previous surveys (Figure 1b), but only two had declines outside the margin of error. Hard coral cover was higher on 17 reefs (Figure 1b), with estimates outside the margin of error on 11 reefs. Region-wide hard coral cover in the Central GBR decreased to the lowest level in LTMP records in 2012, following the impact of severe Tropical Cyclone Yasi in 2011. Hard coral cover then recovered rapidly until 2016. From 2016, region-wide hard coral cover decreased continuously to 2019, largely due to repeated mass coral bleaching in 2016 and 2017 and outbreaks of crown‐of‐ thorns starfish. From 2017 to 2022, hard coral cover recovered, but then declined in 2023. In 2024 it increased to 34.0% (30.3% – 37.9% CIs), the highest level since surveys began, but it remained within the margin of error of the previous two years (Figure 3). There were no Potential, Established or Severe Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish recorded on Central GBR reefs in 2024 (Figure 1c). Nevertheless, small numbers of COTS feeding scars were observed on 11 reefs, indicating the presence of low levels of COTS on these reefs. Cyclone Jasper crossed the Central GBR between Cooktown and Port Douglas in December 2023. No reefs in the cyclone path were surveyed after the cyclone and impacts from this event will be gauged next season. Shortly after the storm, tourism operators noted a large flood plume causing freshwater bleaching and coral mortality at inshore reefs, especially Low Isles, which will be next surveyed in 2025. Cyclone Kirrily transited the Central GBR in late January and resulted in variable impacts on the 22 reefs that were surveyed after the passage of the storm. Some reefs, such as Kelso, John Brewer, Helix and Chicken, had evidence of storm damage and declines in hard coral cover ranging from 6% to 9.9% since last being surveyed. Other reefs appear to have escaped with little impact. Central GBR reefs surveyed by the LTMP were exposed to accumulated heat stress of between 3.37 and 9.31 DHWs over the summer. This resulted in low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching (Image 2C,D) on 16 of the 39 survey reefs in the Central GBR during the 2024 LTMP surveys (Figure 1d). The remaining 23 reefs had no bleaching recorded (Figure 1d, Image 2E,F); however, these reefs were all surveyed in August and September 2023, months before the heat stress occurred. Figure 3: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Central GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 226 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 39 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 23 of these were completed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024, and the impacts of the bleaching remains to be determined. Southern Great Barrier Reef Condition Summary 2024 (Proserpine to Gladstone) Surveyed September 2023 to May 2024 The Southern GBR has generally had higher coral cover than the Northern or Central GBR, but it has also been the most dynamic over the 38-year survey history. Tropical Cyclone Hamish in 2009 reduced coral cover to the lowest levels recorded by the LTMP in 2011 (Figure 4). A rapid and substantial increase in hard coral cover occurred from 2011 to 2017, reaching 36.7% (30.1% – 44.3% CIs). However, outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish began in 2018, and regional coral cover decreased to 29.0% (22.8% – 36.2% CIs) in 2019. In 2021, coral cover had increased to 37.8% (31.6% – 44.4% CIs), but it declined again to 34.0% (29.1% – 38.9% CIs) by 2023 (Figure 4). In 2024, coral cover had increased to 39.1% (33.7% – 44.5% CIs), but it remains within the margin of error of the past three years. The state of individual Southern GBR reefs was variable (Image 3) with nine reefs having hard coral cover >10% – 30%, nine reefs with hard coral cover >30% –50% and 12 reefs with hard coral cover >50% – 75% (Figure 1a). Of the 30 reefs surveyed in 2024, 25 reefs had been surveyed in the past two years. Hard coral cover was lower than previous surveys on five of these, with estimates outside the margin of error on one reef (Figure 1b). Twenty reefs had higher hard coral cover than previously surveyed, of which nine had estimates outside the margin of error (Figure 1b). The Southern GBR has been the epicentre of crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks in recent years and remained so in 2024 with the focus in the Swain reefs. One of the 30 reefs was classified as having a Severe Outbreak, one reef had an Established Outbreak and one reef had a Possible Outbreak (Figure 1c; Image 3A). Low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish were recorded on four reefs classified as No Outbreak and the remainder had No COTS, while COTS outbreaks have run their course on other reefs with low coral cover (Image 3B). In 2024, Southern GBR reefs surveyed by LTMP were exposed to the highest levels of accumulated heat stress (6.22–11.64 DHWs) ever recorded in this region. LTMP manta tow surveys were conducted at 11 reefs during the height of thermal stress in March. Very high bleaching (>60% – 90% of colonies) was recorded at four of these reefs, while three had high (>30% – 60%) bleaching and the remaining four reefs had medium (>10% – 30% bleaching (Figure 1d; Image 3C,D)). Five reefs were surveyed in May after peak heat had occurred and all had bleaching between 1% and 30% of corals. The remaining reefs in this region were all surveyed in September and October 2023, well before the onset of heat stress, with little bleaching recorded (Image 3E,F). Figure 4: Trends in average hard coral cover (blue line) for the Southern GBR based on manta tow surveys. Survey data from 137 reefs contributed to the 38-year time series; blue shading represents 95% credible intervals. A total of 30 reefs were surveyed in 2024, but 14 of these were surveyed prior to the peak heat stress in March 2024. Image 3: Various disturbance events have impacted the Southern GBR in 2024, including coral bleaching and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks. A. A severe outbreak of crown-of-thorns starfish was still active at Tern Island in the Pompeys. B. Elsewhere in the Southern GBR, crown-of-thorns starfish infestations have run their course and reduced coral cover to very low levels, particularly in the Swains, such as Gannet Cay. Coral bleaching was recorded in the Southern GBR including C. Pompey Reef No. 1 and D. Reef 21-060. High coral cover is still found at many reefs in the Southern GBR, like E. Masthead Island and F. Fairfax Island in the Capricorn-Bunkers. More information on individual survey reefs can be found on the AIMS Reef Reporting Dashboard. Why Hard Coral Cover? What does ‘percent hard coral cover’ mean? There are many ways to measure the status of coral reefs. One of the most common is to use percent hard coral cover as an indicator of reef condition because it describes the abundance of a critical ecosystem engineer on coral reefs. This measure describes the proportion of the seafloor that is covered in live hard coral. Percent hard coral cover is widely used by scientists worldwide and is a standard measure that applies to all locations. While it does not tell us anything about the diversity or composition of coral assemblages, it provides a simple and robust measure of reef health. Percent hard coral cover can be estimated using various techniques. The technique used for this report is manta tow surveys, which are visual estimates of percent hard coral cover over the area covered by an observer during one 2-minute tow (~2000 m2). The percent hard coral cover for a reef is then estimated as the average of the estimates from all tows around a reef and reported as broad categories (e.g. 0%, >0% – 10%, >10% – 30%, >30% – 50%, >50% – 75% and >75% – 100%; Image 4). A coral reef consists of more than just hard coral and contains a diverse array of other corals, sponges, algae, sand, rock and invertebrates. It is relatively rare for GBR reefs to have 75% – 100% hard coral cover, and AIMS defines >30% – 50% hard coral cover as a high value, based on historical surveys across the GBR. Other techniques for determining percent hard coral cover involve counting the number of points within sampling units (quadrats and photos), as used by the LTMP during fixed-site surveys, or the linear distance along a tape measure (line-intercept) that intersect live hard coral colonies. Adding up the total number of points of live hard coral cover and then expressing this as a percent of the total number of points within a sample yields the estimates of hard coral cover. Data from both the fixed-site and manta tow surveys conducted by the LTMP are highly correlated and show the same trends in hard coral cover estimates. However, manta tow estimates are commonly lower than those obtained from fixed site surveys as they encompass the entire reef, including sandy back reef habitats that generally have low coral cover. Image 4: Examples of categories of percent hard coral cover a) >0% – 10%, b) >10% – 30%, c) >30% – 50% and d) >50% – 75%. The yellow areas show non-hard coral reef surfaces, and the categorisation is based on the proportion of the substrate covered in live hard coral colonies. The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event In the austral summer of 2023–2024, much of the GBR was subjected to a level of accumulated heat stress that caused mass coral bleaching to occur (Figure 5). This was the fifth mass bleaching event on the GBR since 2016 and part of the fourth global mass bleaching event. In response to this event, AIMS and the Reef Authority undertook aerial surveys of 1080 reefs (Image 5) across the GBR and Torres Strait during the peak summer heat in March 2024. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, AIMS also conducted dedicated in-water bleaching surveys on 36 reefs during this time (22 February to 20 March 2024) to evaluate the prevalence and severity of bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys were conducted from Lizard Island in the Northern GBR to Lady Musgrave Island in the Southern GBR at three depths – Shallow (2–5m), Mid (7–9m) and Deep (9–12m) – and consisted of assessments of the prevalence of coral bleaching (i.e. the number of colonies affected). The level of bleaching of an individual coral colony was recorded as 1. No bleaching 2. Partial bleaching (5%–50% of colony white) 3. Fully bleached (>50% of colony white) 4. Dead (colony recently dead and overgrown with light green algae). Data were then summarised as the percent of colonies in each category at each depth at each site. The 2024 bleaching event had the highest levels of exposure to heat stress to date, with some reefs in the Southern GBR experiencing up to 15 DHWs (Figure 5), far surpassing the level of heat accumulation they had been subjected to in previous events. 2024 also saw a record-breaking spatial footprint of coral bleaching, with 49% of reefs having high levels (>30% of corals bleached) and 32% of reefs having very high to extreme levels of coral bleaching (>60% of corals bleached; Image 6). In-water surveys conducted at the height of the event also confirmed that severe bleaching (whole colonies fully bleached white) was prevalent at 94% of reefs, and recent mortality due to intense thermal stress was present at 89% of reefs across all three regions of the GBR. The severity and prevalence of bleaching was variable among reefs, but some clear regional patterns emerged. The Northern GBR aerial survey reefs were exposed to maximum heat accumulation between 1.84 and 9.7 DHWs over the summer (Figure 5). There was variation in the levels of heat stress accumulation across the Northern GBR. Aerial surveys revealed reefs north of Lockhart River were least affected, while the inner- and mid-shelf reefs between Lizard Island and Cape Sidmouth suffered very high and extreme levels of bleaching after being subjected to accumulated heat stress between 4.9 and 9.7 DHWs. Figure 5: Accumulated heat stress (points on map) and the level of bleaching (bar charts) recorded during aerial surveys of GBR reefs surveyed in March 2024. DHW categories: Bleaching low risk = 0–2 DHWs, Bleaching warning = 2–4 DHWs, Bleaching possible = 4–6 DHWs, Bleaching probable = 6–8 DHWs and widespread bleaching with possible mortality= >8 DHWs.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event Levels of bleaching recorded from aerial surveys showed bleaching intensity decreased further north and at offshore reefs in the region. Throughout the Northern GBR, 27.6% of reefs had no bleaching recorded, 33% had low bleaching and 39.4% had high to extreme bleaching. In-water bleaching surveys (additional to LTMP) within Princess Charlotte Bay and around Lizard Island revealed partial to fully bleached colonies with low levels of early onset mortality at the time of survey (late February and early March 2024). In-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP were conducted just prior to the maximum period of heat stress (mid-March) and are likely to underrepresent the true extent of bleaching at the peak of the event (Figure 6). Furthermore, LTMP surveys in the Northern GBR, including around Lizard Island, were all conducted prior to March 2024, and coral cover for this region had not yet changed in response to this bleaching event. Nevertheless, early-onset low coral bleaching (<10% of corals) was still observed on 17 out of 25 LTMP reefs, and one reef had medium bleaching (>10% to 30% of corals) prior to the onset of elevated heat stress. The Central GBR experienced elevated thermal stress throughout the summer, with aerial survey reefs ranging from 2.4 to 11.4 DHWs (Figure 5). Heat stress accumulation was highest around Cairns (5.1–9.5 DHWs), inshore reefs in the Palm Island Group around Townsville (5.2–9.5 DHWs) and the inner (5.8– 8.95 DHWs) and outer shelf (5.2–11.4 DHWs) reefs of the Whitsundays (Figure 5). Levels of bleaching observed from the aerial surveys closely matched the accumulated heat stress levels. Across the Central GBR, 8.1% of aerial survey reefs were categorised as having no or low bleaching (1% – 10% of corals), 15.8% as having medium bleaching (11% – 30% of corals) and 76.1% having high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals; Figure 5). Around Cairns, 5% of aerial survey reefs had low bleaching, 40% had medium bleaching and 55% had high, very high or extreme bleaching. Townsville inshore aerial surveys recorded 22% of reefs with low bleaching, 18% with medium bleaching and 60% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. Aerial surveys recorded 19% of Whitsunday reefs with low bleaching, 22% with medium bleaching and 59% with high, very high or extreme bleaching. In addition to regular LTMP surveys, dedicated in-water bleaching surveys in the Central GBR recorded variable levels of bleaching prevalence and low levels of early onset coral mortality (Figure 6). In the Central GBR, 23 of 39 LTMP survey reefs were surveyed too early to detect the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event, but 16 reefs were surveyed between March and May 2024. These reefs all had low (<10% of corals) to medium (>10% – 30% of corals) coral bleaching during the 2024 LTMP surveys.

The 2024 Mass Coral Bleaching Event The Southern GBR experienced the most intense exposure of the three regions, with the highest levels of accumulated heat stress on record for the GBR, high prevalence of fully bleached corals and the highest levels of early onset mortality recorded during in-water bleaching surveys (Figures 5, 6). While there was variation in the amount of heat stress recorded among aerial survey reefs (Figure 5), the highest levels of heat stress were recorded in southern inshore reefs around the Keppel Island group (11.4–13.3 DHWs), and further south near Gladstone (15.3–15.6 DHWs – cf LTMP survey reefs). Offshore reefs of the Capricorn-Bunker (10.9–11.7 DHWs) and Swain sectors (7.3–9.9 DHWs) all had heat stress accumulation to the level where widespread bleaching and coral mortality are expected (Figure 5). Aerial surveys also revealed that all reefs around the Keppel Island group and the Capricorn-Bunkers had high, very high or extreme bleaching (>30% of corals), and while the Swain reefs were more variable, 91% of reefs had high, very high or extreme bleaching levels in shallow reef habitats. In the Southern GBR, in-water bleaching surveys additional to LTMP surveys revealed a much higher proportion of fully bleached corals than either the Northern or Central GBR, and higher levels of early onset mortality at the time of in-water bleaching surveys across all three depths (Figure 6). Of the 11 reefs surveyed by the LTMP during the height of the heat stress in March 2024, 7 had high to very high bleaching (>30% – 90%) and a further 4 had medium bleaching of >10% – 30%. All other Southern GBR LTMP reefs were surveyed either before the onset of heat stress or in May 2024, after the heatwave had abated; these surveys recorded bleaching of between 1% and 30%. The results from both the aerial and in-water surveys have documented the greatest spatial extent of accumulated heat stress and high to extreme bleaching to impact the GBR in recorded history. High to extreme bleaching was observed across all regions of the GBR, with the highest impacts in the inshore and mid-shelf reefs in the Southern, Central and Northern GBR. Prevalence of fully bleached corals in the Southern GBR was close to 100% in some shallow-water habitats, and early-onset mortality ranged from 1% to 75%. Reefs with a higher prevalence of partially bleached and fully bleached corals are more likely to suffer adverse health impacts from this bleaching event. Bleaching-related impacts can be direct effects (partial or whole colony mortality) that reduce coral cover or indirect, chronic effects such as reduced growth and reproduction and increased susceptibility to coral disease. These results only partly tell the story. The full effects of the impacts of the 2024 bleaching event will continue to unfold over the coming months, as fully bleached corals can remain that way for several months, as late as September or October, depending on the species. Further in-water surveys at permanent locations are required to capture changes in hard coral cover following the bleaching, and these surveys will begin in September 2024 when the LTMP scientists return to the reef.

Assessing the Long-term Health of the Great Barrier Reef Determining the status of the GBR requires robust, long-term datasets collected using standard methods. Long-term data are particularly important to avoid the ‘shifting baseline’ syndrome, as the results each year are always considered in the context of the long-term trends. The past few years have revealed increases in hard coral cover across much of the GBR. In 2022, we reported the highest-recorded coral cover in the Northern and Central GBR since the LTMP began monitoring in the 1980s, after rising from the lowest-recorded cover in the preceding decade. There was little change in hard coral cover in 2023, but this year coral cover has again increased. However, 60 out of 94 reefs were surveyed before the two cyclones and the mass coral bleaching event and impacts of these events will become apparent once surveys are completed next year. The 2024 mass coral bleaching event was the most extensive in terms of accumulated heat stress and the large spatial footprint of high to extreme bleaching. Some parts of the GBR saw unprecedented levels of heat accumulation. The increased frequency and extent of bleaching events since 2016 remains highly concerning. Crown-of-thorns starfish are coral predators, and their outbreaks represent a major cyclic disturbance on the GBR. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority’s Crown-of-thorns Starfish Control Program has been active on the GBR during the current outbreak. The program deploys targeted surveillance and culling operations to systematically suppress starfish numbers and protect coral across hundreds of priority reefs. Recent evidence from the COTS Control Program and the LTMP demonstrates that targeted control has effectively suppressed outbreaks and protected coral from COTS predation across entire reefs and sectors. The findings also suggest that the southward progression of the outbreak ‘wave’ through the GBR may have been delayed and reduced via the suppression of adult COTS. In 2024, the number of Severe Outbreaks has continued to decrease from previous years, although outbreaks were still recorded in the Swain sector of the Southern GBR. LTMP surveys revealed low numbers of crown-of-thorns starfish in the far northern GBR and around Lizard Island, which suggests that starfish numbers are increasing in these areas. Much of the recent hard coral cover increase was driven by increases in the fast-growing Acropora corals, which have proliferated across many GBR reefs. Once established, these corals enter an exponential growth phase that rapidly increases percent hard coral cover, as documented in the 2022 and 2024 results. However, fast-growing corals are particularly susceptible to waves generated by strong winds and tropical cyclones. They are also highly susceptible to heat stress and are the preferred prey for crown-of-thorns starfish. Therefore, large increases in hard coral cover can quickly be overturned by disturbances on reefs where Acropora corals predominate. The prognosis for the future disturbance regime under climate change is one of increasingly frequent and longer lasting marine heatwaves. The consequences of climate change are evidenced by multiple mass coral bleaching events since 2016 in the three GBR regions. Such bleaching events were rare prior to the late 1990s but have become a biennial occurrence in the last decade. Simultaneously, the continuing risk of tropical cyclones and crown-of-thorns starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as high turbidity, increasing ocean temperatures and changing ocean chemistry, can all negatively affect recovery rates. Additionally, more frequent acute disturbances mean that the intervals for recovery are becoming shorter. Enabling coral reefs to survive these stressful conditions requires a combination of a reduction in global greenhouse emissions to stabilise temperatures, best practice management of local pressures, and the development of interventions to help reefs adapt to and recover from the effects of climate change. Measuring and understanding the process of, and limitations to, coral reef recovery will be a continued focus of AIMS’ research and monitoring.

Coral reefs are critically important ecosystems, providing a wide range of benefits to both humans and marine life. They support extraordinary biodiversity and marine species, including fish, sea mammals, and invertebrates.\nWhile they only cover less than one percent of the ocean, coral reefs support an estimated 25% of sea life. They provide nursery, spawning, refuge, and feeding areas for various sea organisms. These include mollusks, crustaceans, and sea urchins.\nAlso, they play an essential role in water quality and coastal stability. For example, they help to filter sediments and nutrients from the water. Additionally, they act as natural breakwaters. As such, they minimize wave impacts from storms such as hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons.\nThat’s not all; coral reefs form stunning ecosystems that appeal to the eyes. This makes them a powerful tourism attraction feature. In general, coral reefs provide habitat, food, income, protection, and medicine.\nHowever, various factors like water pollution threaten these beautiful sea species. And this calls for their protection. How, then, can we help protect the world’s coral reefs and ensure that they continue to play an important role in the ocean ecosystem?\nTable of Contents\nHow to Conserve Coral Reefs\nIf you want to learn how to conserve coral reefs, here are superb options you can consider.\n1. Learn About the Threats Coral Reefs are Facing\nOne of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself about the threats surrounding coral reefs. You can make informed decisions that help save coral reefs when you are aware of these threats.\nSome of the main threats to coral reef survival include the following:\nPollution can come from various sources, such as agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and sewage effluent. On the other hand, coastal development causes water runoff and sedimentation, which damage coral reefs. Also, it can disrupt coral reef habitats and lead to the introduction of non-native species.\nOverfishing can impact the populations of fish species that eat coral reef algae. This leads to the depletion of coral reef ecosystems.\nClimate change causes increased ocean temperature and oceanic acidity levels. Warmer waters increase the likelihood of coral bleaching events. And more acidic ocean waters harm coral reefs and impede their growth.\nIf we learn how to keep coral reefs healthy and reduce these threats, we can take proactive steps to protect them. In return, this helps guarantee their continued survival.\nSee Related: What is Overfishing? Examples & Solutions to Prevent\n2. Become a Reef-Safe Traveler\nIf you become a reef-safe traveler, you help protect coral reefs. Also, you help protect the beaches and ocean habitats from harm and contribute to the conservation efforts in the coastal areas.\nBut how can you become a reef-safe traveler? There are many ways to do so. First, choose accommodations with minimal environmental impacts. Choose the ones with low-flow faucets and toilets to conserve water when taking a shower or washing dishes.\nYou can also reduce your environmental impact using energy-saving or Energy Star-Certified appliances. Also, switching off lights and electronic devices while not in use or when leaving the room can help.\nWhen walking along the beach, practice responsible tourism. For example, ensure that you don’t touch or step on any coral you see on the beach.\nYou can also be reef safe by using reusable water bottles and bags. Alternatively, buy locally-made eco-friendly products. Always avoid single-use plastics wherever possible.\nKeep off from souvenirs or aquariums made of living coral. And if you must purchase a souvenir, choose one made of wood or another non-coral material.\nLastly, if you have a pet, take steps to prevent it from harming the coral and surrounding environment. When you do so, you will help to conserve these valuable ecosystems for future generations to enjoy.\nSee Related: Best Solutions to Climate Change\n3. Practice Safe Snorkeling and Diving\nOne of the best ways to preserve and protect coral reefs is to practice safe snorkeling and diving. And since snorkeling is a fun activity for many people, doing it responsibly can go a long way.\nThe first step here in protecting these ecosystems is to avoid touching the reefs or anchoring your boat to them. Anchoring can damage or even kill corals. As for touching, it may damage delicate coral animals and reef fishes.\nAnother way to help protect coral reefs is to choose a dive site that is not too close to them. Also, if you see damaged coral, avoid it. Instead, report it to authorities so they can take proper measures to ensure the reef’s health.\nAdditionally, ensure that the visitors on your dive trip do their part to protect the environment. We should all strive to keep coral reefs alive for future generations.\nLastly, avoid destructive actions that can damage the reef ecosystem or deprive it of vital resources for survival. For instance, avoid standing on them or crushing them.\n4. Choose a Reef-Friendly Sunscreen\nAnother common concern for reef-conscious people is the impact of the chemicals sunscreen contains. While many modern sunscreens are safe for coral, some contain dangerous chemicals that can have long-term effects on marine ecosystems.\nWhen buying sunscreen, look for mineral-based sunscreens that use a micro-sized particle or non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients. These are safe and effective and do not contribute to coral bleaching.\nAvoid sunscreens with oxybenzone, Parabens, Triclosan, Octocrylene, Homosalate, and Octinoxate. These ingredients are toxic to coral reefs and other marine life if washed off into the ocean.\nAlways check the sunscreens’ labels to find the active ingredients and choose the ones that will be safe for corals. Finally, ensure the products are in reusable containers or bio-degradable plant-based materials.\nSee Related: Best Books on Pollution | Noise, Air and Water\n5. Dispose of Trash Properly and Recycle\nMarine debris can harm coral reefs. Therefore, reduce throwing trash around as much as possible. Use materials that support the three Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle). When you reuse and recycle the trash at home and on the go, especially those made of plastic, you help conserve the environment.\nDispose of trash properly in the proper cans to avoid the probability of it getting washed away into waterways and oceans.\nWhen on the beach, leave no traces behind. That means don’t throw plastic cans and cigarette butts in the sand. Also, don’t leave unwanted fishing lines on the beach or in the water.\nFinally, you can organize beach or reef cleanups or volunteer at environmental organizations that do such cleanups. Pick up trash from the community and dispose of it properly. Volunteer for annual trash cleanup activities to help protect the oceans from marine debris.\n6. Reduce Stormwater Runoff\nStormwater runoff is the fastest-growing source of pollution. This water flows after the rain hits parking lots, rooftops, and roads. Thus, this untreated water contains a wide range of contaminants.\nReducing stormwater runoff helps reduce flooding, prevent water pollution, and protect our water bodies. To achieve this, homeowners can use rain barrels and gardens to collect rainwater or install water catchments. Conserving water and planting trees can also help reduce runoff into the oceans.\nAvoiding the dumping of wastewater into the ocean can help too. Ensure that it passes through treatment before it reaches the water’s natural bodies, such as tributaries, lakes, rivers, and oceans.\nSee Related: Breaking Down the Best Off-Grid Water Systems\n7. Minimize the Use of Fertilizers\xa0\xa0\nMinimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns can help protect water quality.\nWhen you use fertilizer in gardens, the nutrients, including phosphorous and nitrogen, eventually get washed away into the waterways. Finally, they end up in the ocean, damaging sea life.\nThese fertilizers, chemicals, and pesticides pollute the water and harm coral reefs. Therefore, reducing fertilizer overuse will help save coral reefs.\nAlternatively, consider only organic or ecological fertilizers. These are less likely to contaminate lands and water.\n8. Use Environmentally-Friendly Modes of Transportation\nOpting for a cleaner means of transport reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Vehicles that use gas and fossil fuels release carbon emissions into the environment. These emissions contribute to rising temperatures and ocean acidification, which impede coral growth.\nTherefore, reduce the use of vehicles. Instead, walk, take a bike, or use public transport (like trains and buses) to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide.\nIf you plan to purchase a vehicle, go for a fuel-efficient hybrid or electric car. This helps reduce carbon footprint. Remember, human-generated greenhouse gases are the main contributor to global warming.\n9. Marine Parks and Reserves\nThe creation of marine parks and reserves can play a role in coral reef conservation efforts. First, they can help preserve the threatened marine species or species that can no longer survive in the ocean safely.\nSecondly, the marine protected areas help limit human activity, including commercial fishing, mining, and recreational activities, which may threaten coral reefs.\nPaying a visit to marine parks can help raise awareness about the ocean ecosystem. A perfect example of marine parks in the US is the East End Marine Park, Virgin Islands. It helps protect the largest barrier reef system in the Caribbean Sea. The park comprises 60 square miles of coral reefs and shallow seas, among other ocean inhabitants.\nSee Related: Is Polyvinyl Alcohol Bad for the Environment?\n10. Spread the Word About Coral Conservation\nEducating the community around you about conserving the coral reefs is crucial. First, share this information with your friends and family.\nAdditionally, organize seminars to raise awareness about protecting water quality and conserving coral reefs. Visit local schools around you and teach about coral reef conservation.\nJoin local businesses and organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs. The Planetary Coral Reef Foundation, Coral Reef Alliance, and Reef Relief are examples of organizations working hard to stop coral reef destruction.\nFinally, find out what your local representatives are doing about the conservation efforts and support them where possible. If there has been no activity on the same, write to them and demand action.\nFAQs\nWhat are the main threats to coral reefs?\nThere are numerous threats to coral reefs. But perhaps the major ones include global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, destructive fishing practices, and disease outbreaks. Runoff water from land-based activities, sedimentation from coastal development, and bleaching also form a big part of water pollution which is also a threat to the coral reefs.\nHow can I help protect the coral reefs?\nThe first step towards protecting the coral reefs is reducing your carbon footprint. For example, switching to renewable energy sources.Minimizing the use of fertilizers in gardens and lawns and avoiding wastewater dumping into oceans and waterways will also go a long way. Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n']","In 2024, if the average hard coral cover percentage in the Northern GBR is increased by the percentage of the ocean covered by coral reefs globally in 2023, and then decreased by the percentage of sea life supported by coral reefs, what is the new average hard coral cover percentage?","def solve():

Lastly, you can support organizations dedicated to protecting coral reefs and educating others about conservation efforts.\nWhat is ocean acidification?\nOcean acidification is a process caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It leads to increased acidity in seawater, which can be damaging to corals and other organisms living in these waters.As more carbon dioxide enters the oceans, it decreases pH levels. This, in return, leads to decreased calcification rates and makes it difficult for reef-building organisms to form their calcium carbonate skeletons.\nRelated Resources\nRead These Other Guide\nCategories Environmental Conservation\nPost navigation\nHow Does Saving Water Help Climate Change?\n9 Best Solar-Powered Computers to Buy Today\nRecent Posts\nEco-Friendly Products\nSpecies\nEco-Friendly Products\nEnergy Efficient Products\nSolar Products\nConservation\nAbout\nCopyright OurEndangedWorld | All Rights Reserved\n', ""Accept cookies?\nWe use cookiesÂ\xa0to give you the best online experience and to show personalised content and marketing.

This is a sharp increase from the previous assessment, published in 2008, which found a third of corals were in danger of being lost.\nClimate change is the leading cause of the declines, with high temperatures causing corals to eject the photosynthetic algae that live in their tissues. These events, known as bleaching, are becoming more extreme and more frequent, and causing mass die-offs in reefs across the world.\nThe IUCNâ\x80\x99s Director General, Dr Grethel Aguilar, has called for strong action to limit greenhouse gas emissions as the best option to protect these vital species.\nâ\x80\x9cThis global coral assessment vividly illustrates the severe impacts of our rapidly changing climate on life on Earth and drives home the severity of the consequences,â\x80\x9d she says. â\x80\x9cHealthy ecosystems like coral reefs are essential for human livelihoods â\x80\x93 providing food, stabilising coastlines, and storing carbon.â\x80\x9d\nâ\x80\x9cThe protection of our biodiversity is not only vital for our wellbeing but crucial for our survival. Climate change remains the leading threat to reef-building corals and is devastating the natural systems we depend on. We must take bold, decisive action to cut greenhouse gas emissions if we are to secure a sustainable future for humanity.â\x80\x9d\nCorals get their colour from the photosynthetic algae that live inside them, as part of a relationship which has lasted for over 380 million years. Â© Alexandre.ROSA/ Shutterstock\nHow endangered are corals, and why are they important?\nThe results of the latest Red List are the latest reminder of the dangers that reef-building corals face, with the animals having become more threatened with every reassessment of their health.\nWhile Red List assessments have changed over the past 30 years, itâ\x80\x99s estimated that just 13 coral species were considered Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered in the 1990s. By the time of the next assessment in 2008, this figure had risen to 231.\nIt has now risen again, by more than 100, meaning almost half of all corals are at significant risk of extinction. This makes corals proportionately more endangered than all the major animal groups on land, including amphibians, mammals and reptiles.\nIf these coral species do become extinct, their loss would cause major changes for life in the oceans. Coral reefs support around a quarter of all marine life, and so itâ\x80\x99s likely that coral extinctions could cause losses among fish, crustaceans and many other groups.\nThe loss of coral reefs would also remove an important nursery habitat for fish, as the hard skeletons provide a safe area for small fish to grow up in, away from large predators. Fewer nursery habitats would likely mean fewer fish, impacting both predator populations and fisheries.\nThe economic impact of coral extinctions goes much further than fishing, with reefs estimated to prevent billions of pounds worth of damage from flooding and erosion every year by breaking up waves. Itâ\x80\x99s also likely tourism would suffer, cutting off a vital source of income for many communities.\nThe most at-risk reefs are in the Atlantic, where half of all species are at risk of extinction and a quarter are Critically Endangered. In a separate paper, published in PLOS One, researchers have examined the threats facing these corals in particular.\nThe staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis is found in the Atlantic, and is considered Critically Endangered under the most recent Red List. Â©Â\xa0Alberto RodrÃ\xadguez-RamÃ\xadrez\nWhy are Atlantic corals so threatened?\nWhile the vast majority of reefs are found in the Indian and Pacific Ocean, around 10% are found in the Atlantic. These corals are very distinct from their relatives, having been separated from other corals by the joining of North and South America over three million years ago.\nIn total, 85 shallow-water coral species live in the Atlantic, with the most important hotspots found in the Caribbean and off the coast of Brazil.Â\xa0As study co-author Dr Nadia Santodomingo explains, the limited ability of these species to respond to the threats facing them means these reefs are more vulnerable to collapse.\nâ\x80\x9cAtlantic corals have been hit the hardest by reef decline,â\x80\x9d says Nadia, a Curator of Fossil Cnidaria at the Natural History Museum. â\x80\x9cTheyâ\x80\x99re facing a perfect storm of threats, of which climate change is just one part.â\x80\x9d\nâ\x80\x9cThese corals are being significantly impacted by overfishing, pollution and coral diseases which are more prevalent in the Atlantic than in other regions. As a result, I wasnâ\x80\x99t surprised to see the results of the IUCN assessment.â\x80\x9d\nDisease has perhaps had the most dramatic impact on Atlantic corals, devastating not only the regionâ\x80\x99s corals but also the animals they depend on. An unknown illness is suspected to have killed as much as 98% of the Caribbeanâ\x80\x99s long-spined sea urchins in the 1980s, meaning these grazers couldnâ\x80\x99t prevent algae from dominating many reefs.\nNew diseases are continuing to emerge, with stony coral tissue loss disease first detected in 2014. The illness has spread rapidly throughout the Caribbean, killing as many as 94% of all infected corals.\nRising temperatures are also an increasing threat, with bleaching just the tip of the iceberg. Higher levels of carbon dioxide are making the ocean more acidic, making it harder for corals to grow their calcium carbonate skeletons. Climate change has also been linked with rising numbers of hurricanes in the region, which are washing away centuries-old reefs in a matter of hours.\nWhile the PLOS One study raises plenty of cause for concern, it also notes some reasons to be hopeful. After the devastating declines of the 1970s and 1980s, the researchers found that the fall in Atlantic coral cover appears to be getting smaller.\nTo support these green shoots of recovery, further research needs to be taken to understand how corals can adapt to the challenges that face them. As Dr Beth Polidoro, a co-lead author of the paper, explains, this must go hand in hand with urgent action to combat climate change and the other threats facing coral.\nâ\x80\x9cWe need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions alongside action to address local threats if we want to give coral reefs a chance to survive,â\x80\x9d says Beth. â\x80\x9cBy acting now, we can slow the pace of ocean warming and broaden the window of opportunity for corals to potentially adapt and survive in the long term.â\x80\x9d\nRead more\nDiscover oceans\nFind out more about why we need to protect oceans and read about the pioneering work of our marine scientists.\nRelated posts\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCoral reefs cover more of Earthâ\x80\x99s surface than realised, new estimates reveal\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSatellite images have revealed a missing 64,000 square kilometres of coral cover, an area similar to the size of Ireland.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOver half of coral reef cover across the world has been lost since 1950\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nCoral reefs have declined by over half since the 1950s as they suffer from the effects of climate change and overfishing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe resilient coral reefs surviving ocean warming\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nOcean warming is threatening coral reefs but some reefs are surviving the warming waters and offer hope for these vital ecosystems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHighlighting coral reefs at risk\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nWhat can antique corals reveal about the impact of climate change on the ocean?\nDon't miss a thing\nReceive email updates about our news, science, exhibitions, events, products, services and fundraising activities.

"['Hydrology and Big River Update\nAfter a wet and joyous 2023 water year, water managers and planners are feeling a little less optimistic about 2024. The good times from the previous period of plenty are now replaced with a feeling of foreboding, like the morning after a great party, as we face a below average forecast for 2024.\nLocally, there is good news to lessen the potential whiplash. Water supply conditions remain good with average to above average soil moisture conditions and healthy carryover storage projected for most of the reservoirs in the District. Also potentially hedging against a dry 2024, is the return of a strong El Niño, with near record warming of sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific. This is generally correlated with increased precipitation in the southwestern U.S, especially in the spring. According to NOAA Climate Prediction Center, “El Niño remains the major climate driver and is expected to be the primary influence on the mid-latitude circulation” for the near term. Figure 1 reflects this with a slightly wetter near-term (Jan-March 2024) outlook.\nUnfortunately, the benefits of El Niño circulation patterns may be adversely influenced by the significant warming that is affecting the region and across the globe. Climate scientists have now confirmed that 2023 was officially the warmest year ever for the planet.\n\nAcross the Upper Basin and for inflows to Lakes Powell and Mead, the early water supply forecasts are not good and represent a significant departure from the heady days of 2023; the days of increasing or even stable reservoir levels may not persist into the near-term picture, without some changes.\nSince the last staff hydrology memo presented in October 2023, the once near-average seasonal inflow forecast volume for April to July of 2024 has decreased precipitously, losing more than 3 million acre-feet (“maf”), according to the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center, due to excessively dry conditions. The current unregulated inflow forecast for Lake Powell is 4.80 maf or 75% of average and the unregulated inflow forecast for the entire water year for Lake Powell is 7.62 maf or 79% of average. Combined with a projected 7.48 MAF release from Glen Canyon dam, pursuant to the 2007 Interim guidelines, and consideration evaporation losses, annual inflow could be almost the same as annual outflow putting Lake Powell projected elevations to be unchanged at approximately the same elevation of 3668.5 feet AMSL at this same time next year, under this most probable (50% exceedance) inflow projection.\nFor Lake Mead, the most probable projection indicates that Level 1 shortages will likely persist in the Lower Basin in 2024, with Hoover Dam releases limited to about 8.4 million acre-feet to meet reduced downstream demands.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Posts\t\t\t\t\t\nPhone: 970.945.8522 \nFax: 970.945.8799\nEmail: edinfo@crwcd.org\nColorado River Water Conservation District\n201 Centennial St., Suite 200\nGlenwood Springs, CO 81601\nInteractive Map\nFor accessibility inquiries or assistance, please contact:\nEmail: accessibility@crwcd.org\n', 'Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interiorâ\x80\x99s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basinâ\x80\x99s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretaryâ\x80\x99s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015.

Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies 4: 91-107. \nLearn about the Colorado River Basin\'s network of reservoirs, water delivery infrastructure, and water delivery service areas.\nThe Colorado River is managed with a series of dams and canals that provide flood control, water conservation, and hydropower benefits.\nThe dams and canals in the Colorado River system provide storage for regional water supply, facilitate water deliveries, provide flood control benefits, improve navigation, and generate hydroelectric power. These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river\'s flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam\'s headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin\'s water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Medieval drought in the upper Colorado River Basin. Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin\'s abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basinâ\x80\x99s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as â\x80\x9cconsumptive useâ\x80\x9d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam\'s 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with â\x80\x9cwide-headâ\x80\x9d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Meadâ\x80\x99s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the ""24-Month Study"" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead\'s operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead\'s historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead\'s elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead\'s elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years\' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation\'s website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation\'s Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

"['Drought in the Colorado River Basin\nInsights using open data\nSince 2000, the Colorado River Basin (Basin) has been experiencing a historic, extended drought that has impacted regional water supply and other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and ecologic services. During this time, the Basin has experienced its lowest 16-year period of inflow in over 100 years of record keeping, and reservoir storage in the Colorado River system has declined from nearly full to about half of capacity. \nThis application was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation in support of the Department of the Interiorâ\x80\x99s Open Water Data Initiative (OWDI). This visualization is part of a multi-agency effort to showcase the usefulness of open data (i.e., data provided in a discoverable, sharable, and machine-readable format) by exploring the current 16-year drought and its effects on the Colorado River Basin. \nConcern is growing about the impacts of the ongoing drought and declining reservoir levels, such as decreasing water supply and the possibility of a first-ever shortage condition of drinking water for the Lower Basin; decreasing hydropower capacities at Lake Powell and Lake Mead; the potential for loss of hydroelectric generation at Lake Powell; reduced recreational opportunities; and changes to in-stream flows that support ecosystems.\nIn response to drought conditions, Federal agencies and stakeholders throughout the Basin have been working together to find creative ways to reduce the effects of the drought on the people and resources that rely on water from the Colorado River.\nScroll down to learn more about the importance of the Colorado River, the impacts of the current drought, and the ways in which the drought is being managed in the Basin.\nRead More >>\nThe Colorado River is a lifeline.\nWater from the Colorado River is essential for life in parts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. According to the Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study (2012), the Colorado River and its tributaries:\n Bureau of Reclamation, 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.   \nOne river, two parts.\nApproximately 1,400 miles long and flowing through seven U.S. States and into Mexico, the Colorado River drains roughly one-twelfth of the land area of the contiguous United States. The Colorado River Basin is divided into the Upper and Lower Basins at the Lee Ferry Colorado River Compact Point (Compact Point) located in northern Arizona. The Upper Basin spans portions of Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and northern Arizona. The Lower Basin covers parts of Nevada, Arizona, California, southwestern Utah, and western New Mexico. The Colorado River also supplies water to parts of the states of Baja California and Sonora in northwestern Mexico.\n The Upper Colorado River Basin supplies approximately 90 percent of the water for the entire Basin. This water originates as precipitation and snowmelt in the Rocky and Wasatch Mountains. About 50 percent of streamflow comes from baseflow, which is surface water that percolates into groundwater aquifers and then resurfaces as streamflow (Rumsey et al., 2015). The Lower Basin is arid, with little tributary runoff reaching the mainstream of the Colorado River except during occasional rain events.  \n The Lower Basin depends upon managed use of the Colorado River system to make its surrounding land habitable and productive. Colorado River water is also delivered to areas that lie outside the Basinâ\x80\x99s hydrologic boundary, including parts of southern California, the east side of the Front Range in Colorado, and the west side of the Wasatch Range in Utah. In addition, federally recognized Tribes hold a substantial amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries (approximately 2.9 million acre-feet of annual diversion rights).\nResources and facilities, such as dams and power plants, in the Colorado River Basin are managed to accomplish their project goals in a manner fully consistent with applicable provisions of Federal law including the Law of the River and other project-specific operational guidelines. The Law of the River includes operating criteria, regulations, administrative decisions, Federal statutes, interstate compacts, court decisions and decrees, an international treaty, and contracts with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior (Secretary), and defines the responsibilities of the Secretaryâ\x80\x99s water master role in the Lower Basin.\nRead More >>\nRumsey, C.A., et al. 2015.

These facilities are operated in coordination with adjacent or nearby water delivery systems that also provide a variety of other economic, cultural, and ecologic benefits.\nIn the Lower Basin, Hoover Dam was constructed to control floods, improve navigation and regulate the river\'s flow, provide water storage and delivery, and generate electric energy. Davis Dam and Parker Dam were constructed to regulate water released from Hoover Dam. Near the southern end of the system, Imperial Dam serves as the last diversion dam on the Colorado River for the United States, with Morelos Dam diverting Colorado River water into Mexico.  \nWater is released from these facilities to satisfy delivery commitments to users in Nevada, California, Arizona and Mexico, and to generate hydropower with these water releases. Pumping facilities located on Lake Havasu behind Parker Dam divert water to the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and Central Arizona Project.  From Imperial Dam\'s headworks, water is diverted into the All-American Canal on the California side of the dam and into the Gila Gravity Main Canal on the Arizona side of the dam. These diversions provide water to the Gila Project, the Yuma Project, the Imperial Irrigation District, the Coachella Valley Water District, and the City of Yuma, and to the Northerly International Boundary (NIB) for diversion at Morelos Dam into Mexico. \nRead More >>\nThe diagram above depicts the major dams, reservoirs, and control structures of the Lower Colorado River.\nView real-time data and take a journey through major dams on the Lower Colorado River.\nWater supply varies over time.\nDue to year-to-year differences in precipitation and snowmelt, the natural water supply of the Basin is highly variable. Long-term drought like the Basin has experienced since 2000 reflects natural climate variability coupled with the likely impacts from changing climate. Since most of the Basin\'s water supply comes from the Upper Basin, drought conditions in the Upper Basin impact water supply and resources in both the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River. \nThe U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) stream gage at Lees Ferry, Arizona, is the lowermost mainstream gage in the Upper Basin, located about 12 miles downstream of Glen Canyon Dam and about 1 mile upstream of the Compact Point between the Upper and Lower Basins. Natural flow at this stream gage location is used as a proxy for the hydrologic conditions in the Upper Basin and the overall hydrologic health of the Basin. Natural flow is defined as the streamflow that would have otherwise occurred without the effects of human activities such as reservoir regulation and river diversions.\nIn the graphic above, the 10-year average natural flow at Lees Ferry shows periods of below and above average annual flow (approximately 14.8 million acre-feet [maf]). The most recent drought for the 2000-2015 period (indicated by the brown shaded area) was the driest 16-year period in the past 100 years and one of the driest 16-year periods in the past 1,200 years. The graphic also depicts how the early part of the 1900s, which corresponds to the period of reference used to set the apportionments for the Upper and Lower Basins in the 1922 Colorado River Compact, was an unusually wet period (indicated by the green shaded area). At the time the 1922 Colorado River Compact was signed, the average annual inflow at Lees Ferry during the pre-Compact period (1906-1921) was approximately 18.0 maf.\nUSGS observations of the Colorado River at Lees Ferry (USGS site 09380000) have been recorded since 1895. For more information and data on this site, visit the U.S. Geological Survey National Water Information System Lees Ferry stream gage website. Real-time gage height, discharge, water temperature, sediment, and water-quality properties can be accessed from the U.S. Geological Survey Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center website.\nThe Lees Ferry gage is distinct from the Lee Ferry Compact Point: Lees Ferry refers to the USGS-operated stream gage located near the town of Lees Ferry, Arizona; whereas Lee Ferry refers to the Colorado River Compact Point, as referenced in the 1922 Colorado River Compact. The Lee Ferry Compact Point is located 1 mile downstream of the Lees Ferry gage. \nHistorical observations are extended by a tree-ring reconstruction of streamflow going back approximately 1,200 years, as estimated by Meko et al. (2007a). Because trees grow less during dry years and more during wet years, tree-ring cores can be used to estimate historical streamflow conditions going back many centuries. Tree-ring core samples were collected from locations throughout the Upper Basin to estimate historical natural flow. These estimates were validated using the observed natural flow record developed by the Bureau of Reclamation. \nExplore more about reconstructed natural flow based on tree-ring data.\n 1922 Colorado River Compact.\nBureau of Reclamation. 1922.

This period also ranks as the fifth driest 16-year period in the last 1,200 years (Meko et al., 2007a and 2007b).   \nWhile the current drought is severe and historic, the most extreme drought in the Colorado River Basin occurred in the mid-1100s (Meko et al. 2007a). The 1100s drought was characterized by a 25-year period of flows that were 15% lower than the long-term average of 14.8 maf and no higher-flow years (greater than 125% of average) for six decades. By comparison, the current drought is characterized by flows that are 16% lower than the long-term average with one year of higher flows (135% percent of average in 2011).\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor shows the extent and intensity of drought conditions in the Western U.S. from 2000 to 2015.

Geophysical Research Letters, Vol. 34, L10705.\nThe Colorado River Basin\'s abundant water storage capacity has made the Southwest more resilient to drought.\nThe basin-wide storage capacity of the Colorado River totals about 60 million acre-feet (maf), approximately four times the average annual inflow in the Upper Basin (14.8 maf). The Basinâ\x80\x99s two largest reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead hold about 50 maf combined, which is approximately 83 percent of the total system storage capacity. This large storage capacity creates a buffer against year-to-year hydrologic variability and longer-term drought periods by allowing excess water to be stored during wet years and used during dry years. \nIt is this large amount of basin-wide storage capacity that has allowed the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to meet water delivery requirements during the current drought period. It should be noted, however, that headwater reaches in the Upper Basin can experience localized shortages due to insufficient in-stream flows during dry years.\nThe volume of water that can be stored in the Colorado River system reservoirs (60 million acre-feet) is enough to cover the State of Utah in about 1 foot of water. Dimensions shown above are not to scale.\n Bureau of Reclamation. Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study, 2012. \nDevelopment in the West continues, leading to increased water demand in the Colorado River Basin.\nSince the early 1900s, water demand in the Colorado River Basin has increased while water supply has, on average, decreased. For the 16-year period preceding the signing of the 1922 Colorado River Compact, when the beneficial consumptive use of 7.5 million acre-feet (maf) per year was apportioned to both the Upper and Lower Basins, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 18.0 maf (1906-1921). When the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty was executed, the average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin was about 16.3 maf (1906-1944). The current average annual natural flow in the Upper Basin is about 14.8 maf (1906-2015).  \nAs the average annual natural flow has decreased, the difference between water supply and water demand has narrowed and the Colorado River system has been operating on increasingly close margins. As a result of this decrease in natural flows and an increase in water use basin-wide, it now appears that the Colorado River system is over-allocated (Bureau of Reclamation, 2012).\nClimate projections indicate more extreme conditions are possible, with longer, more severe wet and dry periods. Cooperation and collaboration are key to finding sustainable solutions and addressing current and future water resources management challenges.\nRead More >>\nTrends in water supply and water use in the Colorado River Basin are shown above. When water use (red line) exceeds water supply (blue line) in a given year, the amount of water stored is reduced. During the past 20 years, average water supply and average water use have been about equal. Under these conditions, reservoirs are replenished more slowly. Water-supply and water-use data shown in the graphic above are estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation using water accounting information, U.S. Geological Survey stream gage data, and other sources.\nIn this graphic, water use is shown as â\x80\x9cconsumptive useâ\x80\x9d (surface-water diversions and groundwater pumping minus measured and unmeasured return flows) as estimated by the Bureau of Reclamation in its annual water accounting reports. Other estimates of water use that account for withdrawals of surface and groundwater and incorporate water that is used and returned to the stream, are made by the USGS.\nBureau of Reclamation. 2012. Colorado River Basin Water Supply and Demand Study.\nAccess current reservoir conditions in the Upper Basin and Lower Basin.\nBecause of reduced water supply during the current drought, the elevations of Lakes Mead and Powell have declined.\nAs the reservoir levels of Lake Mead and Lake Powell decline, other resources, such as hydropower, recreation, and water quality, are also affected.\nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Powell can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps are based on U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite surface reflectance-corrected images acquired in the month of June in 1999 and 2014. Landsat images acquired within 16 days of each other have been merged together to generate cloud-free composite satellite images suitable for measurement and change comparison.\n\t\t \nIn the photo slider above, the change in the surface area of Lake Mead can be seen from the pre-drought conditions in 1999 to the current drought conditions as of 2014. The red area that emerges represents the loss in the reservoirâ\x80\x99s surface area as lake elevations have declined. These maps were prepared using the U.S. Geological Survey Landsat satellite data as described in the Lake Powell caption above.   \nBetween 2001 and 2015, Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s elevation dropped from 1,196 to 1,075 feet, a decline of 121 feet. Move the slider on the upper photo to see the decline in the reservoir elevation during this time. The decline in water elevation has exposed a white band of mineralized rock around the shoreline. The declining reservoir level has also exposed portions of Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s four intake towers, two on the right side and two on the left side. These intake towers channel water from Lake Mead into penstocks that serve Hoover Dam\'s 17 hydroelectric generators. Water moves through the generators, creating electricity on the way, and is released back into the Colorado River below the dam. \nThe lower photos show the conditions of Lake Mead and the upstream face of Hoover Dam in 2001 at an elevation of 1,196 feet (left photo) and the conditions in June 2015 at an elevation of 1,075 feet (right photo). The lower photos also show the Nevada spillway in the bottom right corner of the photos. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation estimates that every 1-foot drop in the elevation of Lake Mead reduces Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity by approximately 5.7 megawatts. Since Lake Mead was last full in 2000, Hoover Damâ\x80\x99s powerplant capacity has fallen from 2,074 to 1,563 megawatts (as of August 2015). The Bureau of Reclamation has mitigated some of this impact by replacing traditional turbines with â\x80\x9cwide-headâ\x80\x9d turbines, which are capable of generating more efficiently at lower reservoir levels, and making significant efficiency improvements to the powerplant. \nAt Lake Powell, the generating capacity of the Glen Canyon Dam powerplant is put at risk by declining reservoir levels. Below an elevation of 3,490 feet, Glen Canyon Dam cannot generate power. Based on a Bureau of Reclamation analysis conducted in August 2015, the earliest that this elevation is projected to occur would be 2019 (there is about a 5 percent chance of this occurring). Since Lake Powell finished filling in 1980, its water-surface elevation declined to a maximum low elevation of 3,555 feet (33 percent of capacity) in April 2005, which was approximately 65 feet above the minimum power pool.\nRead More >>\nThe photo slider above shows Hemenway Harbor, located in the southwestern portion of Lake Mead, and the location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,152 feet in January 2003, and the new location of Las Vegas Marina at an elevation of 1,078 feet in May 2015. The photos also depict the increased exposure of Lake Meadâ\x80\x99s shoreline and the emergence of the Boulder Islands, located on the right side of the photo, as the reservoir elevation has declined.\nLake Meadâ\x80\x99s declining reservoir elevation has affected marinas and boat launching facilities at Lake Mead National Recreation Area, requiring the relocation of marinas and the extension of boat ramps to keep recreational facilities open. To continue to provide boat access as reservoir levels have declined, the National Park Service, responsible for the Recreation Area, has been extending boat ramps since 2002 and was expected to about spend $5 million extending ramps in 2015. In 2007, the Overton Beach Marina became inaccessible by water, and facilities from Overton Beach had to be moved to two other marinas, Callville Bay and Temple Bar. In 2008, Lake Mead Marina was moved from the location it had occupied since the 1960s to its current location in Hemenway Harbor.\nIn addition to impacting water supply, changing reservoir levels also influence the aquatic ecosystem. Water-level changes and natural disturbances, such as storm events and resulting local runoff, can re-suspend sediments. Because some Lake Mead sediments contain contaminants, re-suspension of sediment may be of concern to ecological health (Rosen et al., 2012).\nRead More >>\nIllia, T. 2010.

Monthly projections made by the Bureau of Reclamation through an operational model called the ""24-Month Study"" are used to set the operational conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell.\nContinue with the visualization to learn more about Lake Mead\'s operational conditions, how operational conditions are determined, and the potential impacts of drought on water deliveries in the Lower Basin.\nThe graphic above shows Lake Mead\'s historical elevations (on a monthly basis) since 2000, projected elevations for 2016 and 2017, and annual operating conditions. \nAs Lake Mead\'s elevation declines, the Lower Basin comes closer to its first-ever shortage condition. Since the drought began in 2000, Lake Mead\'s elevation has dropped by nearly 140 feet, declining every year except in 2005 and 2011. The Bureau of Reclamation makes projections of Lake Mead elevations and summarizes them in the Colorado River Basin 24-Month Study reports. The 24-Month Study model simulates operations of 12 major reservoirs in the Colorado River Basin. The projections are used to support annual and monthly decisions about how to operate the system looking out 1 to 2 years. The annual operating conditions for Lake Mead and Lake Powell in the upcoming year are based on projected January 1 reservoir elevations from the August 24-Month Study consistent with the 2007 Record of Decision on Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines  ). \nThe 24-Month Study utilizes forecasted Upper Basin inflow hydrology (provided by the Colorado Basin River Forecast Center), projected reservoir operations, projected diversion and consumptive use schedules, and other factors, to generate a single scenario of potential reservoir conditions.\nThe 2007 Interim Guidelines, adopted in December 2007 and in effect through 2026, provide the approved procedure to determine operating conditions and annual releases from Lake Powell and Lake Mead throughout the full range of reservoir operations. The 2007 Interim Guidelines include criteria for implementing shortage and surplus conditions in the Lower Colorado River Basin. The January 1 projections and resulting annual operation for Lake Mead and Lake Powell are reported in the Annual Operating Plan for Colorado River Reservoirs (AOP) for the upcoming year. Current and previous years\' AOPs can be found on the Bureau of Reclamation\'s website.\n\nRead More >>\nLake Mead\nThe Colorado River is one of the primary sources of water for irrigation and domestic use in Arizona, southern California, southern Nevada, and portions of northwestern Mexico.\nThe Bureau of Reclamation\'s Lower Colorado Region keeps records of diversions, return flows, and consumptive use of water delivered from the mainstream of the Colorado River below Lees Ferry to entitlement holders within the Lower Colorado River Basin. \nThe pictogram above depicts average consumptive use by select Lower Colorado River water entitlement holders for the 5-year period from 2010-2014. Each blue block represents a volume of 100,000 acre-feet and partially shaded blue blocks represent volumes less than 100,000 acre-feet. Hover over the bars to see the average consumptive use (2010-2014) by select Lower Colorado River entitlement holders (highlighted in green). \nThe pictogram above depicts the elevation range (from approximately 1,200 to 1,229 feet) and annual water deliveries in the Lower Basin when Lake Mead is operating in a Flood Control Surplus Condition. When in flood control, Lake Mead\'s operations are coordinated with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, according to the 1984 Field Working Agreement between the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  Per the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, when Lake Mead is operating in flood control, an additional 200,000 acre-feet of water will be delivered to Mexico for a total annual delivery of 1.7 million acre-feet. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information. \nA Quantified Surplus Condition or Domestic Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead\'s January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,145 feet and approximately 1,200 feet. In a surplus condition, entitlement holders  in the Lower Basin may take delivery of additional water, as allowed within their entitlements.  As agreed to under Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty, Mexico may also take delivery of additional water within this elevation range. Hover over the blue squares and states to see detailed delivery information.  \nPlease visit the International Boundary and Water Commission website to learn more about the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty and Minute 319 (in effect through 2017).\nRead More >>\nA Normal Condition or Intentionally Created Surplus (ICS) Surplus Condition exists when Lake Mead\'s January 1 elevation for the upcoming year is projected to be between 1,075 and 1,145 feet.

Activities related to drought response include a system conservation program and drought contingency planning efforts in both the Upper and Lower Basins. Additional ongoing activities are being conducted with stakeholders through the Basin Study Moving Forward process and with Native American Tribes through the Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study. Lastly, the implementation of Minute 319 and related binational discussions also underscore the importance of the partnership and continued collaboration between the United States and Mexico. \nPilot System Conservation Program\n In 2014, an $11 million funding agreement for a  Pilot System Conservation Program (PSCP) was executed among the Bureau of Reclamation, Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD), The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWD), Denver Water (DW), and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) (the Funding Partners). The PSCP establishes a mechanism for funding the creation of Colorado River system water through voluntary water conservation actions and reductions in water use beginning in 2015 and continuing through at least 2016. The purpose of the PSCP is to explore the effectiveness of voluntary measures that could be used, when needed, to help maintain water levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead above critical levels. All water conserved as a result of the pilot program would be considered Colorado River system water. Proposals under the PSCP have been received from potential program participants in both the Upper and Lower Basins, where execution of implementation agreements began in 2015 and is ongoing.\nDrought Contingency Planning\nThe Bureau of Reclamation also works with Arizona, California, and Nevada to identify proactive steps to lower the risk of reaching critical elevations at Lake Mead. A step forward was a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for a Pilot Drought Response Actions signed by the Bureau of Reclamation and several water agencies in the Lower Basin States in December 2014. The MOU outlines a commitment by the parties to use best efforts to generate between 1.5 and 3.0 million acre-feet (maf) of additional water in Lake Mead through 2019. The Bureau of Reclamation, MWD, SNWA, and CAWCD have agreed to take first steps to generate 0.740 maf of the additional water by the end of 2017. The MOU is an important first step forward and collaboration continues on potential longer term options.\nIn the Upper Basin, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming are pursuing a plan with three major components: 1) extended operations of the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) reservoirs, 2) voluntary demand management (e.g., fallowing or deficit irrigation), and 3) augmentation (primarily weather modification, such as cloud seeding). The Bureau of Reclamation, in collaboration with the Upper Basin States, has conducted modeling that indicates extended operations of the Upper Basin CRSP reservoirs to move water to Lake Powell can significantly reduce the probability of Lake Powell falling below critical elevations. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Upper Basin States are developing an extended operations plan and implementation agreement. It is anticipated that these will be completed by the end of 2016.\nIn addition to the previously mentioned activities, Congress has authorized additional funding through the Bureau of Reclamation for drought-related activities to increase Colorado River system water in Lake Mead, Lake Powell, and other Colorado River system reservoirs for the benefit of the system. This authorization requires that a report evaluating the effectiveness of the water conservation pilot projects be submitted to Congress in 2018, including a recommendation on whether the activities undertaken by the pilot projects should be continued. \nThe Moving Forward Effort\nIn May 2013, the Bureau of Reclamation and Basin stakeholders initiated the Moving Forward effort to build on future considerations and next steps identified in the Colorado River Basin Study. The Moving Forward effort enhances the broad, inclusive stakeholder process demonstrated in the Basin Study with an ultimate goal of identifying actionable steps to address projected water supply and demand imbalances that have broad-based support and provide a wide range of benefits. The Moving Forward effort is being conducted in a phased approach. Phase 1 began with the formation of a Coordination Team and three multi-stakeholder workgroups that focus on water conservation, reuse and environmental and recreational flows. In May, 2015 the Phase 1 Report was published, which documents the activities and outcomes of the workgroups during this phase and includes opportunities for potential future action.  \nTribal Water Study\nBegun in late 2013, the Colorado River Basin Ten Tribes Partnership Tribal Water Study is a cooperative effort with the Ten Tribes Partnership, whose members hold a significant amount of quantified and unquantified Federal reserved water rights to the Colorado River and its tributaries. The study builds on the technical foundation of the Colorado River Basin Study by further assessing water supplies and demands for these Tribes and identifies tribal opportunities and challenges associated with the development of tribal water. This study is anticipated to be completed in 2016.\nBinational Partnership\nIn November 2012, the United States and Mexico reached agreement on Minute 319 to the 1944 U.S.-Mexico Water Treaty. Minute 319 is a 5-year agreement (2013-2017) that provides for a series of joint cooperative actions between the United States and Mexico, including surplus sharing during higher Lake Mead conditions, reduced water deliveries during lower Lake Mead conditions, flexibility with the Intentionally Created Mexican Apportionment mechanism, opportunities for improved and more efficient infrastructure, and water for the environment. In 2014, a pulse flow of approximately 105,000 acre-feet was delivered to Mexico from March 23 through May 18 to benefit the riparian ecosystem in the Colorado River Delta. Implementation of the pulse flow also involved a monitoring component conducted by scientists and experts from the United States and Mexico to determine the environmental benefits of the pulse flow and the overall performance of the pilot project. With the success of the binational implementation of this project, the United States and Mexico hope to develop a new binational agreement in the spirit of continued collaboration to meet future water resources management challenges ahead. \nRead More >>\nBureau of Reclamation System Conservation Pilot Program.

See Guide to this Report for more on\nassessments of likelihood and confidence.\n6.0: Introduction\nTemperature is among the most important climatic elements used in\ndecision-making. For example, builders and insurers use temperature\ndata for planning and risk management while energy companies and\nregulators use temperature data to predict demand and set utility\nrates. Temperature is also a key indicator of climate change: recent\nincreases are apparent over the land, ocean, and troposphere, and\nsubstantial changes are expected for this century. This chapter\nsummarizes the major observed and projected changes in near-surface\nair temperature over the United States, emphasizing new data sets\nand model projections since the Third National Climate Assessment\n(NCA3). Changes are depicted using a spectrum of observations,\nincluding surface weather stations, moored ocean buoys, polar-orbiting\nsatellites, and temperature-sensitive proxies. Projections are based\non global models and downscaled products from CMIP5 (Coupled Model\nIntercomparison Project Phase 5) using a suite of Representative\nConcentration Pathways (RCPs; see Ch. 4: Projections for more on\nRCPs and future scenarios).\n6.1: Historical Changes\n6.1.1 Average Temperatures\nChanges in average temperature are described using a suite of\nobservational datasets. As in NCA3, changes in land temperature are\nassessed using the nClimGrid dataset.1\n,2\nAlong U.S. coastlines,\nchanges in sea surface temperatures are quantified using a new\nreconstruction3\nthat forms the ocean component of the NOAA Global Temperature\ndataset.4\nChanges in middle tropospheric temperature are examined using updated\nversions of multiple satellite datasets.5\n,6\n,7\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States has\nrisen since the start of the 20th century. In general, temperature\nincreased until about 1940, decreased until about 1970, and increased\nrapidly through 2016. Because the increase was not constant over\ntime, multiple methods were evaluated in this report (as in NCA3)\nto quantify the trend. All methods yielded rates of warming that\nwere significant at the 95% level. The lowest estimate of 1.2°F\n(0.7°C) was obtained by computing the difference between the average\nfor 1986–2016 (i.e., present-day) and the average for 1901–1960\n(i.e., the first half of the last century). The highest estimate\nof 1.8°F (1.0°C) was obtained by fitting a linear (least-squares)\nregression line through the period 1895–2016. Thus, the temperature\nincrease cited in this assessment is 1.2°–1.8°F (0.7°–1.0°C).\nThis increase is about 0.1°F (0.06°C) less than presented in NCA3,\nand it results from the use of slightly different periods in each\nreport. In particular, the decline in the lower bound stems from\nthe use of different time periods to represent present-day climate\n(NCA3 used 1991–2012, which was slightly warmer than the 1986–2016\nperiod used here). The decline in the upper bound stems mainly from\ntemperature differences late in the record (e.g., the last year of\ndata available for NCA3 was 2012, which was the warmest year on\nrecord for the contiguous United States).\nEach NCA region experienced a net warming through 2016 (Table 6.1).\nThe largest changes were in the western United States, where average\ntemperature increased by more than 1.5°F (0.8°C) in Alaska, the\nNorthwest, the Southwest, and also in the Northern Great Plains.\nAs noted in NCA3, the Southeast had the least warming, driven by a\ncombination of natural variations and human influences.8\nIn most regions, average\nminimum temperature increased at a slightly higher rate than average\nmaximum temperature, with the Midwest having the largest discrepancy,\nand the Southwest and Northwest having the smallest. This differential\nrate of warming resulted in a continuing decrease in the diurnal\ntemperature range that is consistent with other parts of the globe.9\nAnnual average\nsea surface temperature also increased along all regional coastlines\n(see Figure 1.3), though changes were generally smaller than over\nland owing to the higher heat capacity of water. Increases were\nlargest in Alaska (greater than 1.0°F [0.6°C]) while increases\nwere smallest (less than 0.5°F [0.3°C]) in coastal areas of the\nSoutheast.\nMore than 95% of the land surface of the contiguous United States\nhad an increase in annual average temperature (Figure 6.1). In\ncontrast, only small (and somewhat dispersed) parts of the Southeast\nand Southern Great Plains experienced cooling. From a seasonal\nperspective, warming was greatest and most widespread in winter,\nwith increases of over 1.5°F (0.8°C) in most areas. In summer,\nwarming was less extensive (mainly along the East Coast and in the\nwestern third of the Nation), while cooling was evident in parts\nof the Southeast, Midwest, and Great Plains.\nFigure 6.1\nObserved changes in annual, winter, and summer temperature (°F). Changes are the difference\nbetween the average for present-day (1986–2016) and the average for the first half of\nthe last century (1901–1960 for the contiguous United States, 1925–1960 for Alaska and Hawai‘i).\nEstimates are derived from the nClimDiv dataset.\n1\n,2\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nThere has been a rapid increase in the average temperature of the\ncontiguous United States over the past several decades. There is\ngeneral consistency on this point between the surface thermometer\nrecord from NOAA1\nand the middle tropospheric satellite records from Remote Sensing\nSystems (RSS),5\nNOAA’s Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR),7\nand the University\nof Alabama in Huntsville (UAH).6\nIn particular, for the\nperiod 1979–2016, the rate of warming in the surface record was\n0.512°F (0.284°C) per decade, versus trends of 0.455°F (0.253°C),\n0.421°F (0.234°C), and 0.289°F (0.160 °C) per decade for RSS version\n4, STAR version 3, and UAH version 6, respectively (after accounting\nfor stratospheric influences). All trends are statistically significant\nat the 95% level. For the contiguous United States, the year 2016\nwas the second-warmest on record at the surface and in the middle\ntroposphere (2012 was the warmest year at the surface, and 2015 was\nthe warmest in the middle troposphere). Generally speaking, surface\nand satellite records do not have identical trends because they do\nnot represent the same physical quantity; surface measurements are\nmade using thermometers in shelters about 1.5 meters above the\nground whereas satellite measurements are mass-weighted averages\nof microwave emissions from deep atmospheric layers. The UAH record\nlikely has a lower trend because it differs from the other satellite\nproducts in the treatment of target temperatures from the NOAA-9\nsatellite as well as in the correction for diurnal drift.10\nRecent paleo-temperature evidence confirms the unusual character\nof wide-scale warming during the past few decades as determined\nfrom the instrumental record. The most important new paleoclimate\nstudy since NCA3 showed that for each of the seven continental\nregions, the reconstructed area-weighted average temperature for\n1971–2000 was higher than for any other time in nearly 1,400 years,11\nalthough with\nsignificant uncertainty around the central estimate that leads to\nthis conclusion. Recent (up to 2006) 30-year smoothed temperatures\nacross temperate North America (including most of the continental\nUnited States) are similarly reconstructed as the warmest over the\npast 1,500 years12\n(Figure 6.2). Unlike the PAGES 2k seven-continent result mentioned\nabove, this conclusion for North America is robust in relation to\nthe estimated uncertainty range. Reconstruction data since 1500 for\nwestern temperate North America show the same conclusion at the\nannual time scale for 1986–2005. This time period and the running\n20-year periods thereafter are warmer than all possible continuous\n20-year sequences in a 1,000-member statistical reconstruction\nensemble.13\n6.1.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.2\nPollen-based temperature reconstruction for temperate North America.\nThe blue curve depicts the pollen-based reconstruction of 30-year\naverages (as anomalies from 1904 to 1980) for the temperate region\n(30°–55°N, 75°–130°W). The red curve shows the corresponding tree\nring-based decadal average reconstruction, which was smoothed and\nused to calibrate the lower-frequency pollen-based estimate. Light\n(medium) blue zones indicate 2 standard error (1 standard error)\nuncertainty estimations associated with each 30-year value. The\nblack curve shows comparably smoothed instrumental temperature\nvalues up to 1980. The dashed black line represents the average\ntemperature anomaly of comparably smoothed instrumental data for\nthe period 2000–2006. (Figure source: NOAA NCEI).\nShifts in temperature extremes are examined using a suite of\nsocietally relevant climate change indices14\n,15\nderived from long-term\nobservations of daily surface temperature.16\nThe coldest and warmest\ntemperatures of the year are of particular relevance given their\nwidespread use in engineering, agricultural, and other sectoral\napplications (for example, extreme annual design conditions by the\nAmerican Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning;\nplant hardiness zones by the U.S. Department of Agriculture). Cold\nwaves and heat waves (that is, extended periods of below or above\nnormal temperature) are likewise of great importance because of\ntheir numerous societal and environmental impacts, which span from\nhuman health to plant and animal phenology. Changes are considered\nfor a spectrum of event frequencies and intensities, ranging from\nthe typical annual extreme to the 1-in-10 year event (an extreme\nthat only has a 10% chance of occurrence in any given year). The\ndiscussion focuses on the contiguous United States; Alaska, Hawai‘i,\nand the Caribbean do not have a sufficient number of long-term\nstations for a century-scale analysis.\nCold extremes have become less severe over the past century. For\nexample, the coldest daily temperature of the year has increased\nat most locations in the contiguous United States (Figure 6.3). All\nregions experienced net increases (Table 6.2), with the largest\nrises in the Northern Great Plains and the Northwest (roughly 4.5°F\n[2.5°C]), and the smallest in the Southeast (about 1.0°F [0.6°C]).\nIn general, there were increases throughout the record, with a\nslight acceleration in recent decades (Figure 6.3). The temperature\nof extremely cold days (1-in-10 year events) generally exhibited\nthe same pattern of increases as the coldest daily temperature of\nthe year. Consistent with these increases, the number of cool nights\nper year (those with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile\nfor 1961–1990) declined in all regions, with much of the West having\ndecreases of roughly two weeks. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile for\n1961–1990) has fallen over the past century (Figure 6.4). The\nfrequency of intense cold waves (4-day, 1-in-5 year events) peaked\nin the 1980s and then reached record-low levels in the 2000s.17\nFigure 6.3\nObserved changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures (°F) of the year in the contiguous United States.\nMaps (top) depict changes at stations; changes are the difference between the average for present-day (1986–2016)\nand the average for the first half of the last century (1901–1960). Time series (bottom) depict the area-weighted\naverage for the contiguous United States. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with minimal missing data\nin the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily dataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nFigure 6.4\nObserved changes in cold and heat waves in the contiguous United States. The top panel depicts changes\nin the frequency of cold waves; the middle panel depicts changes in the frequency of heat waves; and the\nbottom panel depicts changes in the intensity of heat waves. Cold and heat wave frequency indices are\ndefined in Zhang et al.,15\nand the heat wave\nintensity index is defined in Russo et al.14\nEstimates are\nderived from long-term stations with minimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in warm extremes are more nuanced than changes in cold\nextremes. For instance, the warmest daily temperature of the year\nincreased in some parts of the West over the past century (Figure\n6.3), but there were decreases in almost all locations east of the\nRocky Mountains. In fact, all eastern regions experienced a net\ndecrease (Table 6.2), most notably the Midwest (about 2.2°F [1.2°C])\nand the Southeast (roughly 1.5°F [0.8°C]). The decreases in the\neastern half of Nation, particularly in the Great Plains, are mainly\ntied to the unprecedented summer heat of the 1930s Dust Bowl era,\nwhich was exacerbated by land-surface feedbacks driven by springtime\nprecipitation deficits and land mismanagement.18\nHowever, anthropogenic\naerosol forcing may also have reduced summer temperatures in the\nNortheast and Southeast from the early 1950s to the mid-1970s,19\nand agricultural\nintensification may have suppressed the hottest extremes in the\nMidwest.20\nSince the mid-1960s, there has been only a very slight increase in\nthe warmest daily temperature of the year (amidst large interannual\nvariability). Heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile for 1961–1990) increased in frequency\nuntil the mid-1930s, became considerably less common through the\nmid-1960s, and increased in frequency again thereafter (Figure 6.4).\nAs with warm daily temperatures, heat wave magnitude reached a\nmaximum in the 1930s. The frequency of intense heat waves (4-day,\n1-in-5 year events) has generally increased since the 1960s in most\nregions except the Midwest and the Great Plains.17\n,21\nSince the early 1980s\n(Figure 6.4), there is suggestive evidence of a slight increase in\nthe intensity of heat waves nationwide14\nas well as an increase\nin the concurrence of droughts and heat waves.22\nFigure 6.5\nObserved changes in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures\nin the contiguous United States. Red bars indicate a year with more\ndaily record highs than daily record lows, while blue bars indicate\na year with more record lows than highs. The height of the bar\nindicates the ratio of record highs to lows (red) or of record lows\nto highs (blue). For example, a ratio of 2:1 for a blue bar means\nthat there were twice as many record daily lows as daily record\nhighs that year. Estimates are derived from long-term stations with\nminimal missing data in the Global Historical Climatology Network–Daily\ndataset.16\n(Figure source: NOAA/NCEI).\nChanges in the occurrence of record-setting daily temperatures are\nalso apparent. Very generally, the number of record lows has been\ndeclining since the late-1970s while the number of record highs has\nbeen rising.23\nBy extension, there has been an increase in the ratio of the\nnumber of record highs to record lows (Figure 6.5). Over the past\ntwo decades, the average of this ratio exceeds two (meaning that\ntwice as many high-temperature records have been set as low-temperature\nrecords). The number of new highs has surpassed the number of new\nlows in 15 of the last 20 years, with 2012 and 2016 being particularly\nextreme (ratios of seven and five, respectively).\n6.2: Detection and Attribution\n6.2.1\nAverage Temperatures\nWhile a confident attribution of global temperature increases to\nanthropogenic forcing has been made,24\ndetection and attribution\nassessment statements for smaller regions are generally much weaker.\nNevertheless, some detectable anthropogenic influences on average\ntemperature have been reported for North America and parts of the\nUnited States (e.g., Christidis et al. 2010;25\nBonfils et al. 2008;26\nPierce et al.\n200927\n).\nFigure 6.6 shows an example for linear trends for 1901–2015,\nindicating a detectable anthropogenic warming since 1901 over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States for\nthe CMIP5 multimodel ensemble—a condition that was also met for\nmost of the individual models.28\nThe Southeast stands out\nas the only region with no “detectable” warming since 1901; observed\ntrends there were inconsistent with CMIP5 All Forcing historical\nruns.28\nThe\ncause of this “warming hole,” or lack of a long-term warming trend,\nremains uncertain, though it is likely a combination of natural and\nhuman causes. Some studies conclude that changes in anthropogenic\naerosols have played a crucial role (e.g., Leibensperger et al.\n2012a,b;29\n,30\nYu et al. 201431\n), whereas other studies infer a possible large role for atmospheric\ncirculation,32\ninternal climate variability (e.g., Meehl et al. 2012;8\nKnutson et al.\n2013a28\n), and\nchanges in land use (e.g., Goldstein et al. 2009;33\nXu et al. 201534\n). Notably, the\nSoutheast has been warming rapidly since the early 1960s.35\n,36\nIn summary, there\nis medium confidence for detectable anthropogenic warming over the\nwestern and northern regions of the contiguous United States.\nFigure 6.6\nDetection and attribution assessment of trends in annual average\ntemperature (°F). Grid-box values indicate whether linear trends\nfor 1901–2015 are detectable (that is, distinct from natural\nvariability) and/or consistent with CMIP5 historical All-Forcing\nruns. If the grid-box trend is found to be both detectable and\neither consistent with or greater than the warming in the All-Forcing\nruns, then the grid box is assessed as having a detectable anthropogenic\ncontribution to warming over the period. Gray regions represent\ngrid boxes with data that are too sparse for detection and attribution.\n(Figure source: updated from Knutson et al. 2013;28\n© American Meteorological\nSociety. Used with permission.)\n6.2.2\nTemperature Extremes\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC’s) Fifth\nAssessment Report (AR5)24\nconcluded that it is very likely that human influence has\ncontributed to the observed changes in frequency and intensity of\ntemperature extremes on the global scale since the mid-20th century.\nThe combined influence of anthropogenic and natural forcings was\nalso detectable (medium confidence) over large subregions of North\nAmerica (e.g., Zwiers et al. 2011;37\nMin et al. 201338\n). In general,\nhowever, results for the contiguous United States are not as\ncompelling as for global land areas, in part because detection of\nchanges in U.S. regional temperature extremes is affected by extreme\ntemperature in the 1930s.17\nTable 6.3 summarizes\navailable attribution statements for recent extreme U.S. temperature\nevents. As an example, the recent record or near-record high March–May\naverage temperatures occurring in 2012 over the eastern United\nStates were attributed in part to external (natural plus anthropogenic)\nforcing;39\nthe century-scale trend response of temperature to external forcing\nis typically a close approximation to the anthropogenic forcing\nresponse alone. Another study found that although the extreme March\n2012 warm anomalies over the United States were mostly due to natural\nvariability, anthropogenic warming contributed to the severity.40\nSuch statements\nreveal that both natural and anthropogenic factors influence the\nseverity of extreme temperature events. Nearly every modern analysis\nof current extreme hot and cold events reveals some degree of\nattributable human influence.\n6.3: Projected Changes\n6.3.1 Average Temperatures\nTemperature projections are based on global model results and\nassociated downscaled products from CMIP5 using a suite of\nRepresentative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). In contrast to NCA3,\nmodel weighting is employed to refine projections of temperature\nfor each RCP (Ch. 4: Projections; Appendix B: Model Weighting).\nWeighting parameters are based on model independence and skill over\nNorth America for seasonal temperature and annual extremes. Unless\nstated otherwise, all changes presented here represent the weighted\nmultimodel mean. The weighting scheme helps refine confidence and\nlikelihood statements, but projections of U.S. surface air temperature\nremain very similar to those in NCA3. Generally speaking, extreme\ntemperatures are projected to increase even more than average\ntemperatures.41\nThe annual average temperature of the contiguous United States is\nprojected to rise throughout the century. Increases for the period\n2021–2050 relative to 1976–2005 are projected to be about 2.5°F\n(1.4°C) for a lower scenario (RCP4.5) and 2.9°F (1.6°C) for the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5); the similarity in warming reflects the\nsimilarity in greenhouse gas concentrations during this period\n(Figure 4.1). Notably, a 2.5°F (1.4°C) increase makes the near-term\naverage comparable to the hottest year in the historical record\n(2012). In other words, recent record-breaking years may be “common”\nin the next few decades. By late-century (2071–2100), the RCPs\ndiverge significantly, leading to different rates of warming:\napproximately 5.0°F (2.8°C) for RCP4.5 and 8.7°F (4.8°C) for RCP8.5.\nLikewise, there are different ranges of warming for each scenario:\n2.8°–7.3°F (1.6°–4.1°C) for RCP4.5 and 5.8°–11.9°F (3.2°–6.6°C) for\nRCP8.5. (The range is defined here as the difference between the\naverage increase in the three coolest models and the average increase\nin the three warmest models.) For both RCPs, slightly greater\nincreases are projected in summer than winter (except for Alaska),\nand average maximums will rise slightly faster than average minimums\n(except in the Southeast and Southern Great Plains).\nFigure 6.7\nProjected changes in annual average temperatures (°F). Changes are\nthe difference between the average for mid-century (2036–2065; top)\nor late-century (2070-2099, bottom) and the average for near-present\n(1976–2005). Each map depicts the weighted multimodel mean. Increases\nare statistically significant in all areas (that is, more than 50%\nof the models show a statistically significant change, and more\nthan 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nStatistically significant warming is projected for all parts of the\nUnited States throughout the century (Figure 6.7). Consistent with\npolar amplification, warming rates (and spatial gradients) are\ngreater at higher latitudes. For example, warming is largest in\nAlaska (more than 12.0°F [6.7°C] in the northern half of the state\nby late-century under RCP8.5), driven in part by a decrease in snow\ncover and thus surface albedo. Similarly, northern regions of the\ncontiguous United States have slightly more warming than other\nregions (roughly 9.0°F [5.5°C] in the Northeast, Midwest, and\nNorthern Great Plains by late-century under RCP8.5; Table 6.4). The\nSoutheast has slightly less warming because of latent heat release\nfrom increases in evapotranspiration (as is already evident in the\nobserved record). Warming is smallest in Hawai‘i and the Caribbean\n(roughly 4.0°–6.0°F [2.2°–3.3°C] by late century under RCP8.5)\ndue to the moderating effects of surrounding oceans. From a\nsub-regional perspective, less warming is projected along the coasts\nof the contiguous United States, again due to maritime influences,\nalthough increases are still substantial. Warming at higher elevations\nmay be underestimated because the resolution of the CMIP5 models\ndoes not capture orography in detail.\nRCP4.5\nMid-Century\n(2036–2065)\nRCP8.5\nMid-Century\n(2036–2065)\nRCP4.5\nLate-Century\n(2071–2100)\nRCP8.5\nLate-Century\n(2071–2100)\n6.3.2 Temperature Extremes\nFigure 6.8\nProjected changes in the coldest and warmest daily temperatures\n(°F) of the year in the contiguous United States. Changes are the\ndifference between the average for mid-century (2036–2065) and the\naverage for near-present (1976–2005) under the higher scenario\n(RCP8.5). Maps in the top row depict the weighted multimodel mean\nwhereas maps on the bottom row depict the mean of the three warmest\nmodels (that is, the models with the largest temperature increase).\nMaps are derived from 32 climate model projections that were\nstatistically downscaled using the Localized Constructed Analogs\ntechnique.51\nIncreases are\nstatistically significant in all areas (that is\xad\xad,\nmore than 50% of the models show a statistically significant change,\nand more than 67% agree on the sign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC\nand NOAA NCEI).\nDaily extreme temperatures are projected to increase substantially\nin the contiguous United States, particularly under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5). For instance, the coldest and warmest daily\ntemperatures of the year are expected to increase at least 5°F\n(2.8°C) in most areas by mid-century,42\nrising to 10°F (5.5°C)\nor more by late-century.43\nIn general, there will\nbe larger increases in the coldest temperatures of the year,\nespecially in the northern half of the Nation, whereas the warmest\ntemperatures will exhibit somewhat more uniform changes geographically\n(Figure 6.8). By mid-century, the upper bound for projected changes\n(i.e., the average of the three warmest models) is about 2°F (1.1°C)\ngreater than the weighted multimodel mean. On a regional basis,\nannual extremes (Table 6.5) are consistently projected to rise\nfaster than annual averages (Table 6.4). Future changes in “very\nrare” extremes are also striking; by late century, current 1-in-20\nyear maximums are projected to occur every year, while current\n1-in-20 year minimums are not expected to occur at all.44\nThe frequency and intensity of cold waves is projected to decrease\nwhile the frequency and intensity of heat waves is projected to\nincrease throughout the century. The frequency of cold waves (6-day\nperiods with a minimum temperature below the 10th percentile) will\ndecrease the most in Alaska and the least in the Northeast while\nthe frequency of heat waves (6-day periods with a maximum temperature\nabove the 90th percentile) will increase in all regions, particularly\nthe Southeast, Southwest, and Alaska. By mid-century, decreases in\nthe frequency of cold waves are similar across RCPs whereas increases\nin the frequency of heat waves are about 50% greater in the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5) than the lower scenario (RCP4.5).45\nThe intensity of cold\nwaves is projected to decrease while the intensity of heat waves\nis projected to increase, dramatically so under RCP8.5. By mid-century,\nboth extreme cold waves and extreme heat waves (5-day, 1-in-10 year\nevents) are projected to have temperature increases of at least\n11.0°F (6.1°C) nationwide, with larger increases in northern regions\n(the Northeast, Midwest, Northern Great Plains, and Northwest; Table\n6.5).\nFigure 6.9\nProjected changes in the number of days per year with a maximum\ntemperature above 90°F and a minimum temperature below 32°F in the\ncontiguous United States. Changes are the difference between the\naverage for mid-century (2036–2065) and the average for near-present\n(1976–2005) under the higher scenario (RCP8.5). Maps in the top row\ndepict the weighted multimodel mean whereas maps on the bottom row\ndepict the mean of the three warmest models (that is, the models\nwith the largest temperature increase). Maps are derived from 32\nclimate model projections that were statistically downscaled using\nthe Localized Constructed Analogs technique.51\nChanges are statistically\nsignificant in all areas (that is, more than 50% of the models show\na statistically significant change, and more than 67% agree on the\nsign of the change45\n). (Figure source: CICS-NC and NOAA NCEI).\nThere are large projected changes in the number of days exceeding\nkey temperature thresholds throughout the contiguous United States.\nFor instance, there are about 20–30 more days per year with a maximum\nover 90°F (32°C) in most areas by mid-century under RCP8.5, with\nincreases of 40–50 days in much of the Southeast (Figure 6.9). The\nupper bound for projected changes is very roughly 10 days greater\nthan the weighted multimodel mean. Consistent with widespread\nwarming, there are 20–30 fewer days per year with a minimum temperature\nbelow freezing in the northern and eastern parts of the nation,\nwith decreases of more than 40–50 days in much the West. The upper\nbound for projected changes in freezing events is very roughly 10–20\ndays fewer than the weighted multimodel mean in many areas.\nReferences\nModal\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n1800 G Street, NW, Suite 9100, Washington, DC 20006 USA\nTel: +1 202.223.6262 | Fax: +1 202.223.3065\nContact Us •\nCredits •\nPrivacy Policy •\nSite Map\nSome figures and images are copyright protected.\nPermission of the copyright owner must be obtained\nbefore making use of copyrighted material.']","Considering the severe drop in Lake Mead's elevation and its impact on Hoover Dam's power capacity, calculate the total reduction in power capacity in megawatts due to the decline in Lake Mead's elevation from 2001 to 2015, given that for every 1-foot drop in elevation, the power capacity of Hoover Dam is reduced by 5.7 megawatts.

Numerous other climatic effects are also expected. For example, U.S. precipitation, which increased by 5 to 10% over the 20th century, is predicted to continue to increase overall. More specifically, an ensemble of GCMs predicts a 20% increase for northern North America, a 15% increase in winter precipitation for northwestern regions, and a general increase in winter precipitation for central and eastern regions. Despite predictions of increased precipitation in most regions, net decreases in water availability are expected in those areas, due to offsetting increases in evaporation. A 20% decrease in summer precipitation, for example, is projected for southwestern regions, and a general decrease in summer precipitation is projected for southern areas. Although projected regional impacts of climate change are highly variable between models, the above impacts are consistent across models. \nGlobal Climate Change And Water Resources\nAdditional effects of global climate change that have important implications for water resources include increased evaporation rates, a higher proportion of precipitation received as rain, rather than snow, earlier and shorter runoff seasons, increased water temperatures, and decreased water quality in both inland and coastal areas. The physical and economic consequences of each of these effects are discussed below. \nIncreased evaporation rates are expected to reduce water supplies in many regions. The greatest deficits are expected to occur in the summer, leading to decreased soil moisture levels and more frequent and severe agricultural drought. More frequent and severe droughts arising from climate change will have serious management implications for water resource users. Agricultural producers and urban areas are particularly vulnerable, as evidenced by recent prolonged droughts in the western and southern United States, which are estimated to have caused over $6  billion in damages to the agricultural and municipal sectors. Such droughts also impose costs in terms of wildfires, both in terms of control costs and lost timber and related resources.\nWater users will eventually adapt to more frequent and severe droughts, in part by shifting limited water supplies towards higher-value uses. Such shifts could be from low- to high-value crops, or from agricultural and industrial to environmental and municipal uses. A period of delay is likely, however, because gradual changes in the frequency and severity of drought will be difficult to distinguish from normal inter-annual variations in precipitation. Economic losses will be larger during this period of delay, as compared to a world with instantaneous adjustment, but preemptive adaptation could also be costly given the uncertainty surrounding future climate. \nRising surface temperatures are expected to increase the proportion of winter precipitation received as rain, with a declining proportion arriving in the form of snow. Snow pack levels are also expected to form later in the winter, accumulate in smaller quantities, and melt earlier in the season, leading to reduced summer flows. Such shifts in the form and timing of precipitation and runoff, specifically in snow-fed basins, are likely to cause more frequent summer droughts. Research shows that these changes are already taking place in the western United States. Changes in snow pack and runoff are of concern to water managers in a number of settings, including hydropower generation, irrigated agriculture, urban water supply, flood protection and commercial and recreational fishing. Timing of runoff will affect the value of hydropower potential in some basins if peak water run-off occurs during nonpeak electricity demand. Energy shortages and resulting energy price increases will provide incentives to expand reservoir capacities or develop alternative energy sources. \nIf the runoff season occurs primarily in winter and early spring, rather than late spring and summer, water availability for summer-irrigated crops will decline, and water shortages  will occur earlier in the growing season, particularly in watersheds that lack large reservoirs. Agricultural producers, in response to reduced water supplies and crop yields, will adjust their crop mix. Producers in irrigated regions might reduce total planted acreage, or deficit-irrigate more acres, to concentrate limited water supplies on their most valuable crops (e.g. onions and potatoes, rather than wheat and alfalfa). Producers in rain-fed regions might shift to crop species and varieties with shorter growing season requirements or greater drought tolerance, such as winter grains. \nCropping practices are likely to shift as well, perhaps towards reduced- or no-till technologies, which enhance water infiltration and conserve soil moisture, or towards irrigation technologies that are more efficient at the farm level (although not necessarily at the basin level). Producers may begin to supplement dwindling surface water supplies with groundwater resources, a response that has already been observed in many drought-stricken areas. These adjustments will mitigate a portion of private economic losses. They will also affect environmental quality, although the expected direction is more difficult to predict. \nA shift in stream hydrographs to more winter flow may also disrupt the life cycle of cold water fish species, such as salmon, which depend on late spring flows to \x93flush\x94 young salmon to the ocean, and on summer flows to moderate water temperatures. Unless winter runoff is captured and stored for late spring or summer use, fewer salmon smolt will survive migration and more frequent fish kills will occur from lethal stream water temperatures. Such environmental impacts will intensify debates about consumptive versus instream water uses, such as those ongoing in the Klamath and Platte River Basins. \nClimate change is expected to affect water quality in both inland and coastal areas. Specifically, precipitation is expected to occur more frequently via high-intensity rainfall events, causing increased runoff and erosion. More sediments and chemical runoff will therefore be transported into streams and groundwater systems, impairing water quality. Water quality may be further impaired if decreases in water supply cause nutrients and contaminants to become more concentrated.  Rising air and water temperatures will also impact water quality by increasing primary production, organic matter decomposition, and nutrient cycling rates in lakes and streams, resulting in lower dissolved oxygen levels.  Lakes and wetlands associated with return flows from irrigated agriculture are of particular concern. This suite of water quality effects will increase the number of water bodies in violation of today\x92s water quality standards, worsen the quality of water bodies that are currently in violation, and ultimately increase the cost of meeting current water quality goals for both consumptive and environmental purposes.  \nRising sea levels could also reduce water quality and availability in coastal areas. Recent projections of sea-level rise by the end of the 21st century range from 19 to 58 cm. A more dramatic increase in sea-level, on the order of meters rather than centimeters, is possible, but most scientists consider it a low probability risk. For example, complete melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet or West Antarctic Ice Sheet would trigger such a large rise. Rising sea levels could affect groundwater quality directly via saltwater intrusion. Radical changes to the freshwater hydrology of coastal areas, caused by saltwater intrusion, would threaten many coastal regions\x92 freshwater supplies. \nRising sea levels could also affect water availability in coastal areas indirectly by causing water tables in groundwater aquifers to rise, which could increase surface runoff at the expense of aquifer recharge. Water shortages will cause the price of water to rise, through monthly water bills or one-time connection fees for new homes and businesses. A sufficiently large price increase could affect the extent and pattern of urban growth throughout the United States. Costly water supply projects, such as desalination plants, pipelines, and dams will also become more economically attractive. \nOne final and important effect of the water resource impacts discussed above is the potential for more frequent and intense interstate and international water allocation conflicts. Water markets have the potential to prevent or diffuse such conflicts; however, the assignment of water rights to establish the market can create more conflict than it diffuses.\nCoping With Changing Water Resources\nAlthough subject to uncertainty, forecasts of climatic change offer a glimpse into possible future water resource impacts and challenges. Predicted impacts vary by region, but include increased temperatures and evaporation rates; higher proportions of winter precipitation arriving as rain, not snow; earlier and more severe summer drought, and decreased water quality. Water shortages, which currently result in substantial economics losses, will be more common in many regions because of these impacts. Such economic losses, which occur across a range of sectors, from agriculture to energy and recreation, have profound effects on local communities. More frequent shortages imply increased costs to society, although adaptation by water users will mitigate some portion of these costs. \nWater resource users can reduce the negative effects of water shortages through a number of strategies. These include revising water storage and release programs for reservoirs, adopting crops and cropping practices that are robust over a wider spectrum of water availability, expanding and adjusting crop insurance programs (such as the Multi-Peril Crop Insurance program\x92s Prevented Planting Provision), adjusting water prices to encourage conservation and the expansion of water supply infrastructure, and supporting water transfer opportunities. Damage from drought-induced wildfires can be minimized by using long range soil moisture forecasts to pre-position fire suppression resources and in the longer term, by changing land-use regulations to restrict development in areas facing increased fire risk.\nThe ability to anticipate and efficiently prepare for future water resource management challenges is currently limited, in part, by imprecise regional climate change models and long-term weather forecasts. Uncertainty about future climate conditions makes it more difficult to optimally prepare for and adapt to associated changes in water resource availability and quality. Imagine, for example, trying to prepare optimally for a water shortage when you are uncertain of when it will occur, how severe it will be, or how long it will persist. It may be tempting to make management plans based on the worst-case scenario; however, the opportunity cost of this \x93safety-first\x94 approach can be high if the worst-case does not occur. Imperfect information ultimately increases the magnitude of economic losses (or reduce the magnitude of any potential economic gains) attributable to water resource changes. \nImprovements in climate projections and long-term weather forecasts, such as forecasts based on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon (ENSO), offer potential for reducing economic losses (or increasing economic gains) associated with climate change. More specifically, improvements in the ability to detect water shortages farther in advance, to more precisely forecast their location, intensity, and duration, and to use such forecasts to inform management strategies would enhance water users\x92 confidence in regional forecasts, and their ability to efficiently prepare for and adapt to future water resource management challenges.\nFor More Information\nAdams, R.M  and D.

No major rise in deaths has been reported.\nScientists outside of China have attempted to assess the patterns of illness independently. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the U.K.\'s University of East Anglia, told the Science Media Centre on November 22 that the illness in children was a fever with no cough or other symptoms although, in some cases, pulmonary nodules had been seen on chest x-rays.\n""Whilst we can\'t make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause,"" Hunter said.\n""Pulmonary nodules in children are seen in pneumococcal pneumonia and cough may be absent. Influenza can catch patchy changes on chest X-ray, often due to secondary bacterial infections so [that] could also be in the frame.\n""Whilst we can\'t make a definitive diagnosis at this stage the presence of pulmonary nodules tend to suggest a bacterial rather than a viral cause.""\nHunter added that it did not sound like an epidemic due to a novel virus, adding that he would ""expect to see many more infections in adults"" in that case.\nNonetheless, some concerns have grown that older Chinese residents may come into contact with pathogens during family gatherings later in the year.\nThe pattern of China\'s outbreak suggests it began several months ago, Chinese health experts told various state media publications this week. They expect cases to peak in the next 2-3 weeks, but infections could last through next spring.\nHealth officials have urged the public to get vaccinated for relevant diseases.\nHow Many People Have Been Affected and Where?\nWhile there have been localized reports from hospitals across China, the total number of patients across the country isn\'t clear.\nChinese state media has reported that in Taizhou in East China\'s Zhejiang province, as of Friday, November 24, the positive rate of influenza virus in outpatient cases in the city had increased to 50 percent.\nThe Tianjin Children\'s Hospital, located in a major port city near the capital Beijing, reported on November 18 a single-day record of 13,171 young patients across its outpatient and emergency departments, according to a local newspaper. The geographical spread of cases, spanning over 400 miles from Beijing to Liaoning, suggested a wider outbreak that began in northern China.\nLast week, state-run CCTV news reported that in the capital of Beijing, hospitals had been operating at full capacity for over a month in response to this spike in infection. Beijing Children\'s Hospital revealed that its internal medicine department had seen more than 7,000 cases daily. Beijing Jingdu Children\'s Hospital highlighted a significant rise in mycoplasma pneumonia infections, placing immense pressure on medical resources, with 90 percent of the hospital\'s 300 beds occupied and long queues forming outside.\nOn November 21, Chinese media and ProMed, the alert system known for its role in bringing attention to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019, reported that there had been clusters of undiagnosed pneumonia among children in northern China, although it was unclear if this was related to the reported respiratory outbreaks.\nProMed first reported numerous children being admitted to hospitals with high fevers but without typical pneumonia symptoms.\nIn northern China, which appears to be experiencing the worst of the outbreak, respiratory infections have surged for five consecutive weeks, accounting for 6.2 percent of outpatient and emergency visits, at a rate 2.5 times the average of the past three years, Lo Yi-chun, the deputy director of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Sunday, citing World Health Organization (WHO) data.\nHealth authorities such as the WHO have repeatedly asked China for further epidemiological data.\nDr. Maria Van Kerkhove, acting director of the WHO\'s Department of Epidemic and Pandemic Preparedness and Prevention, said on Thursday: ""We are following up with the situation in China and again, they have seen overall an increase in acute respiratory infections due to a number of different pathogens, including influenza, which is on the rise.""\nShe continued, ""Mycoplasma pneumonia was on the rise for the last couple of months and now seems to be a little bit on the decline. We are following up through our clinical networks and working clinicians in China to better understand resistance to antibiotics which is a problem across the world.""\nWhat\'s the Relative Risk to Other Parts of the World?\nThe Taiwan Centers for Disease Control said on Saturday that the island\'s ports and airports were all put on ""high alert."" Notices were placed at these locations urging travelers arriving from mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau to seek medical attention if symptomatic, and disclose their travel history to healthcare providers.\nFang Chi-Tai, a professor at the Institute of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine at National Taiwan University, told Newsweek on Monday that Taiwan had heightened disease surveillance and recommends preventive measures such as mask-wearing as well as maintaining personal hygiene upon arrival in China.\nTaiwan\'s public health authority said individuals planning trips to China should consider receiving vaccines for COVID and influenza at the earliest opportunity.\nNearby nations such as India and Vietnam have said that while they are not seeing an uptick in cases, their health systems are preparing and have reached out to health authorities such as the WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for advice.\nHowever, the relative risk according to experts appears to be low. Speaking to healthcare publication STAT, the WHO\'s Van Kerkhove reiterated the view that the spike in cases was due to an immunity gap in China, following the lifting of COVID restrictions, and was something most other countries had already dealt with.\n""This is not an indication of a novel pathogen. This is expected,"" Kerkhove said.\n""This is what most countries dealt with a year or two ago.\n""We asked about comparisons prior to the pandemic. And the waves that they\'re seeing now, the peak is not as high as what they saw in 2018-2019.""\nSpeaking to CNN, Dr. Leana Wen, former Baltimore Health Commissioner and professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the cases should not cause global concern.\n""The spikes are ""not unexpected given the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, as similarly experienced in other countries,"" according to WHO, she said.\n""Importantly, no new pathogen has been detected. There has also been no unusual clinical presentation with children appearing much sicker than normal.""\n\nTop stories\n\nSeth Moulton Faces Protest in Hometown After Controversial Trans Remarks\n\nFox News Host Confronts Mike Johnson With GOP Demand for Matt Gaetz Report\n\nWhat RFK Jr. Has Said About Ozempic the Popular Weight Loss Drug\n\nWhat Will Trump\'s New Term Mean for A.I.?\nAbout the writer\n\n\n\nThe Debate\n\nTrump\'s War on the D.C.

Blue bars indicate cooler-than-average years; red bars show warmer-than-average years. NOAA Climate.gov graph, based on data from the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nGiven the tremendous size and heat capacity of the global oceans, it takes a massive amount of heat energy to raise Earth’s average yearly surface temperature even a small amount. The roughly 2-degree Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) increase in global average surface temperature that has occurred since the pre-industrial era (1880-1900) might seem small, but it means\xa0a significant increase in accumulated heat.\nThat extra heat is driving regional and seasonal temperature extremes, reducing snow cover and sea ice, intensifying heavy rainfall, and changing habitat ranges for plants and animals—expanding some and shrinking others.\xa0 As the map below shows, most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas, and the Arctic is warming faster than most other regions.\nTrends in global average surface temperature between 1993 and 2022 in degrees Fahrenheit per decade. Most of the planet is warming (yellow, orange, red). Only a few locations, most of them in Southern Hemisphere oceans, cooled over this time period. NOAA Climate.gov map, based on data from NOAA Centers for Environmental Information.\nAbout surface temperature\nThe concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100°F (55°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the ""average"" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth\'s energy budget—how much sunlight\xa0Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time.\nTo calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute\xa0temperature readings\xa0to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple\xa0independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.\nAcross inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate\xa0the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth\'s surface temperature over time. Read more about how the global surface temperature record is built in our Climate Data Primer.\nGlobal temperature in 2022\nAccording to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Niña climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The ""coolest"" month was November, which was 1.35 ˚F (0.75 ˚C) warmer than average.\n(map) Global average surface temperature in 2022 compared to the 1991-2020 average, with places that were warmer than average colored red, and places that were cooler than average colored blue. (graph) The bars on the graph show global temperatures compared to the 20th-century average each year from 2022 (right) back to 1976 (left)–the last year the world was cooler than average. NOAA Climate.gov image, based on data from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.\nAccording to NCEI,\nThe year 2022 was the sixth warmest year since global records began in 1880 at 0.86°C (1.55°F) above the 20th century average of 13.9°C (57.0°F). This value is 0.13°C (0.23°F) less than the record set in 2016 and it is only 0.02°C (0.04°F) higher than the last year\'s (2021) value, which now ranks as the seventh highest. The 10 warmest years in the 143-year record have all occurred since 2010, with the last nine years (2014–2022) ranking as the nine warmest years on record.\nFor more regional details and 2022 climate statistics, see the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA\'s National Centers for Environmental Information.\nPast and future change in global temperature\nThough warming has not been uniform across the planet, the upward trend in the globally averaged temperature shows that more areas are warming than cooling. According to NOAA\'s\xa02021 Annual Climate Report the combined\xa0land and ocean temperature has increased at an average rate of\xa00.14 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.08 degrees\xa0Celsius)\xa0per decade since 1880; however, the average rate of increase since 1981 has been more than twice as fast: 0.32 °F (0.18 °C) per decade.\nThe amount of future warming Earth will experience depends on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in coming decades. Today, our activities—burning fossil fuels and clearing forests—add about 11 billion metric tons of carbon (equivalent to a little over 40 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide) to the atmosphere each year. Because that is more carbon than natural processes can remove, atmospheric carbon dioxide increases each year.\n(left) Hypothetical pathways of carbon emissions (""representative concentration pathways,"" or RCPs) throughout the twenty-first century based on different possible energy policies and economic growth patterns.

"[""Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is Delivering in Florida As of March 2024 The Biden-Harris Administration has hit the ground running to implement the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and it is already delivering results for the people of Florida. To date, $16.2 billion in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding has been announced and is headed to Florida with over 593 specific projects identified for funding. Since the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed, approximately $11.1 billion has been announced for transportation – to invest in roads, bridges, public transit, ports and airports – and roughly $995 million has been announced for clean water and water infrastructure. Florida received $2.1 billion to connect everyone in the state to reliable high-speed internet and, as of today, more than 1,708,000 Florida households are already saving on their monthly internet bill due to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Many more projects will be added in the coming months, as funding opportunities become grant awards and as formula funds become specific projects. By reaching communities all across Florida – including rural communities and historically underserved populations – the law makes critical investments that will improve the lives of Floridians and position the state for success. Roads and Bridges: In Florida, there are 455 bridges and over 3,144 miles of highway in poor condition. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild our roads and includes the single largest dedicated bridge investment since the construction of the interstate highway system. Based on formula funding alone, Florida is expected to receive approximately $13.3 billion over five years in federal funding for highways and bridges. ● Announced funding to date: $8.5 billion has been announced in Florida for roads, bridges, roadway safety, and major projects. This includes: o $7.7 billion in highway formula funding and $158 million in dedicated formula funding for bridges to date. o $117.1 million through the RAISE program to date. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $207 million through the INFRA program to date. Internet: High-speed internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, participate in school, access health care, and stay connected. Yet over 272,962 homes and small businesses in Florida do not have access to high-speed internet infrastructure. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $65 billion to provide affordable, high-speed internet to everyone in America. The Biden-Harris Administration worked with internet providers to offer high-speed internet plans that are fully covered by the Affordable Connectivity Program — meaning most eligible households can now get high-speed internet without paying a dime. Now, the Biden-Harris Administration is calling on Congress to extend this program through 2024. Without action from Congress, millions of Americans will lose their internet connection and the economic opportunities that come with it. See ACP enrollment for every state and territory here. ● Announced funding to date: To date, Florida has received $2.1 billion for high-speed internet. Florida has received $1.2 billion through the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program to provide access to high-speed internet to everyone in Florida. Florida also received $2.8 million in funding to expand middle-mile infrastructure in the state. In addition, about 1,708,000 households in Florida are enrolled in the Affordable Connectivity Program. Water: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law represents the largest investment in water infrastructure in American history, including the first-ever dedicated federal funding to replace lead service lines and address dangerous PFAS chemicals. ● Announced funding to date: $995 million has been announced to Florida to provide clean and safe water across the state and improve water infrastructure. This includes: ○ $995 million available to date to provide clean and safe water across the state through the Environmental Protection Agency. Of this funding, $366.4 million is dedicated to lead pipe and service line replacement, with another $229.8 million for safe drinking water investments that can also support lead pipe replacement. Public Transit: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history. Based on formula funding alone, Florida would expect to receive approximately $2.8 billion over five years under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to improve public transit across the state.1 This funding will expand healthy, sustainable transportation options in Florida, where non-white households are 3.5 times more likely to commute via public transportation and 19% of transit vehicles in the state are currently past useful life. 1 Transit formula funding amounts are subject to changes resulting from the 2020 census or from annual transit service data reported to FTA’s National Transit Database. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 ● Announced funding to date: Florida has been allocated $1.3 billion to improve public transportation options across the state. Clean Buses: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $10 billion for clean public transit and school buses. This includes a $5 billion investment over the next five years to replace existing school buses with zero-emission and low-emission models. Use of clean school buses promotes cleaner air, reduced health risks, especially for children, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Announced funding to date will double the number of clean transit buses on America’s roads. ● Announced funding to date: Schools in Florida have been awarded $45 million through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School Bus Program. Communities in Florida were awarded $58.1 million for clean transit buses and improved bus service through DOT’s Low- and No- Emission Bus and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. Electric Vehicle Charging: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $7.5 billion to build the first-ever national network of electric vehicle chargers in the United States and is a critical element of President Biden’s plan to address the climate crisis and support domestic manufacturing jobs. Through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Program alone, Florida should expect to receive roughly $198 million in formula funding over five years to support the expansion of electric vehicle charging in the state. ● Announced funding to date: $113.7 million has been announced in Florida to date to build out a network of EV chargers in the state. Clean Energy & Power: Power outages cost the U.S. economy about $150 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to upgrade our power infrastructure by making the grid more resilient and building thousands of miles of new transmission lines to deliver clean, affordable electricity. The law also makes a historic investment in clean energy technologies like advanced nuclear, clean hydrogen, carbon capture, and batteries, as well as a historic $3.5 billion investment in weatherization to improve energy efficiency of homes and lower energy costs for impacted households by an average of $372 per year. ● Announced funding to date: Approximately $392.4 million has been allocated to Florida for clean energy, energy efficiency, and power. This includes: o $93.6 million for weatherization; o $16.8 million through the State Energy Program; Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 o $24.7 million through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program; o $162.8 million to prevent outages and make the power grid more resilient. Airports: According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $25 billion in airports to replace and modernize airport infrastructure, which helps the U.S. become more economically competitive globally, creates good jobs, and revitalizes and supports more efficient and enhanced traveler experience. ● Announced funding to date: Florida has received approximately $1 billion for airports. Ports and Waterways: Our ports and waterways are in need of repair and investment. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests $17 billion in port infrastructure to strengthen our supply chains, address maintenance backlogs, and reduce congestion and emissions near ports– ultimately helping our country move goods more quickly and at lower cost. ● Announced funding to date: Florida has received roughly $128.3 million for ports and waterways. Florida was awarded $24.9 million for 3 port projects through the Port Infrastructure Development Program. Resilience: Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change and extreme weather every day. More frequent hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, floods, unprecedented power outages, and persistent droughts devastate our communities and threaten our infrastructure. In the last decade, Florida has experienced 10 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $227 billion in damages. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law makes a historic investment to bolster our resilience against pressing challenges like impacts of climate change, extreme weather events, and other hazards like cyberattacks. ● Announced funding to date: Approximately $1.5 billion has been allocated to Florida for infrastructure resilience, including $51.5 million through the Army Corps of Engineers for flood mitigation. Legacy Pollution Cleanup: Across the country, thousands of former industrial, chemical, and energy sites emit harmful pollutants into surrounding communities. These sites pose harms to health, welfare, and economic prosperity — and disproportionately impact communities of color: 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will deliver the largest investment in tackling Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells. ● Announced funding to date: $123 million has been allocated to cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites. Approximately $25 million has been allocated to Florida for capping orphaned oil and gas wells and reclaiming abandoned mine lands.

Florida Project Spotlights INFRA Award Spotlight I-4 Truck Parking Facilities The Florida Department of Transportation has received $180 million to add approximately 917 truck parking spaces across four sites along I-4 in District Five in Central Florida, which includes locations in Volusia County, Seminole County and Osceola Counties. This project addresses the shortage of overnight parking for commercial vehicles in this region, which also reduces safety issues such as fatigue and unauthorized parking. The project will also incorporate electric charging stations. See here for a full list of INFRA awards. Resilience Project Spotlight Everglades Restoration The Army Corps of Engineers awarded nearly $1.1 billion to the Everglades for ecosystem restoration activities. Years of human development have isolated portions of the Everglades and altered natural flow patterns for freshwater. These projects will help regulate the inflows and outflows of water that are the lifeline of this ecosystem, helping restore the rich biodiversity of the Everglades’ two million acres of wetlands. Thriving wetlands will also filter out pollution to improve water quality for the one-third of Floridians who rely on the Everglades for drinking water, and will help improve resilience to flooding that impacts the state. This historic funding marks the single largest investment in Everglades’ history. See here for the full list of U.S. Army Corps projects announced in 2022. Announced Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding is as of March 7, 2024 Grid Innovation Spotlight Improving Reliability Through Grid Hardening in Florida The Department of Energy is awarding $52.9 million to the Sumter Electric Cooperative to improve reliability of its power grid. This project consists of multiple inter-related components that SECO Energy has developed in response to the need for accelerated resilience efforts. Multiple tropical storms and hurricanes have crossed directly through SECO Energy’s service territory with winds and flooding causing damage and disruptions. SECO Energy’s proposed project will enhance resilience by undergrounding overhead utility lines; hardening existing poles and increasing line capacity; replacing aging, inefficient equipment; and expanding load capacity with a new distribution substation.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nSeptember 2024 Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks\n\nNOAA and its partners have released the latest Regional Climate Impacts and Outlooks, which recap summer conditions and provide insight into what might be expected this fall.\nSummer Temperature Recap\nThe meteorological summer (June–August) average temperature for the contiguous U.S. was 73.8°F, 2.5°F above average, which is the fourth-warmest summer in the 130-year record. Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.The Alaska summer temperature was 51.7°F, 1.3°F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.For the January–August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9°F, 3.0°F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January–August period on record.\nThe Alaska January–August temperature was 31.2°F, 2.4°F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June–August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.For summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.The January–August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January–August period.The January–August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month’s consolidation.\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\xa0\n\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October–December 2024.\xa0\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\xa0\nNOAA’s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n© Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\xa0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n© Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\xa0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

"[""\n\t\t\tCalifornia’s intensive care nightmare: Which hospitals are full?\t\t\nShare this:\nIn summary\nIn the worst-hit counties, some hospitals are sending critically ill patients to other counties. Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\xa0WhatMatters\xa0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\xa0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\xa0\n“That really bottlenecks us right in the front door,” said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno’s Community Regional Medical Center and the county’s interim health officer. “We’re very worried.”\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\xa0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n“We are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,” said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. “We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\xa0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\nΔ\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\xa0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\xa0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\xa0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\xa0\n“We’re tired. We’re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,” said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county’s two hospitals. “It’s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It’s going to be exhausting, stretching.”\n“We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\xa0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\xa0\n“That person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,” Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\xa0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. “Number one, she’s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there’s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it’s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.”\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\xa0\n“Our hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,” Vohra said. “When you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that’s 500 to 1000 people that are out.”\xa0\nSome are out because they’re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\xa0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure — at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar’s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\xa0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn’t been cleared to talk to the press, said she’s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\xa0\n“I was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter’s while doing everything else,” she said. “It’s such a juggling act.”\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\xa0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\xa0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county’s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\xa0\n“We are full with patients coming to us through the front door,” Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital’s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. “Nothing about COVID-19 is typical.”\xa0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\xa0\n“ICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,” Castro said. “They are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.”\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\xa0\nIt’s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County — the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, “hospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,” Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\xa0\nSince October, Modoc County — wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet — has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county’s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average. Without an ICU, the county had to transfer sicker patients to the Central Valley over the past two weeks, according to county public health officer Eric Sergienko. Typically, that includes hospitals in Modesto as well as Vohra’s congested Community Regional Medical Center in Fresno.\xa0\n“We have the ability to do an improvised ICU should we have to hold patients but this is clearly not the preferred option,” Sergienko said.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people, and has already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties.\nEven small counties that do have their own ICUs need to transfer patients who require a higher level of care than they can provide. Colusa County, for instance, has three ICU beds — none of which were occupied as of Monday, according to county counsel Marcos Kropf. (State data reports that zero ICU beds are available in Colusa. The state did not respond to a request for clarification.)\nBut Colusa County has nevertheless needed to transfer patients to hospitals elsewhere, including Chico, Roseville and Marysville. And in Marysville, the only ICU serving nearly 176,000 people in Sutter and Yuba counties is full, according to a health advisory released Friday.\xa0\nPhuong Luu, health officer for both Sutter and Yuba counties, wrote that the surge has led hospitalizations at Adventist Health and Rideout in Marysville to almost triple.\xa0\nMonica Arrowsmith, a spokesperson for the hospital, would not say Friday whether the ICU was at capacity or whether the hospital had enough staff, but she said the hospital has access to additional supplies, expertise and support from the rest of the Adventist Health system.\xa0\nLuu, however, said the ICU “is full because of the surge in COVID-19 patients needing ICU level care. There are not enough ICU nurses to expand for more ICU beds,” according to the health advisory. “The current COVID-19 situation is dire in Yuba-Sutter.”\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state has requested 815 medical staffers, including 435 specifically for ICUs, from contractors and most are expected within a week, with Imperial County a high priority. The state has also asked the federal government for help staffing ICUs.\xa0\nImperial County’s El Centro Regional Medical Center plans to open 21 beds in a 50-bed parking lot tent facility today with staffing from the state, according to hospital CEO Edward. He also said the state will allow the hospital to increase the number of patients each nurse can care for. He hopes the changes will help the hospital increase its staffed ICU beds to 32 from 20.\nExhausted healthcare workers\nThe onslaught of cases after nine months of a pandemic are pushing healthcare workers to the brink. The word repeated by each healthcare worker CalMatters interviewed was “exhausted.”\xa0\n“Exhausted. Oh man. Exhausted and frustrated,” said one Northern California emergency medicine physician, who asked that her name and hospital not be named because she had not been cleared to speak to the press. “And a little scared about what’s going to happen soon.”\xa0\nAlready, she said, she’s finding it increasingly difficult to transfer patients needing specialty care.\xa0\n“I called every single hospital in Northern California out to Reno and all the Bay Area hospitals, and they all refused to take this patient,” the doctor said, adding that she found a local doctor who could help. “For those non-COVID patients who still need speciality care, that’s going to prove to be a big problem.”\xa0\nEven at hospitals that still have room in their ICUs, healthcare workers are feeling the emotional toll of the prolonged pandemic.\xa0\n“For those non-covid patients who still need speciality care, that’s going to prove to be a big problem.”\xa0\n“It’s really going to be dependent on this post-Thanksgiving surge,” said Nick Sawyer, an emergency medicine physician at UC Davis Health. “There is a very real possibility that we will overwhelm the system and people will end up in a hospital that is overwhelmed, that doesn’t have the staffing that is necessary to provide that best care.”\xa0\nSawyer said that he traveled to New York to help the overwhelmed hospitals during the early days of the pandemic, and was shaken by what he saw there.\xa0\n“Families have to say goodbye to their loved ones over Facetime,” he said. “It’s devastating to the family. It’s devastating to the nurses. It’s devastating to the physicians. It’s just not a normal thing we’re used to doing. And it’s so impersonal, for something that’s so personal.”\xa0\nBefore that experience, he said, it wouldn’t even register when he heard an ambulance siren.\xa0\n“Now when I hear an ambulance go by, I feel this heaviness in the pit of my stomach of like, ‘Is that another coronavirus patient that’s going to be going into the hospital?’” he said. “I’m emotionally exhausted by it, even though we’re just getting going.”\xa0\nCalMatters COVID-19 coverage, translation and distribution is supported by generous grants from the Penner Family Foundation, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Wellness Foundation and the California Health Care Foundation.\nRead more from CalMatters\nText\nGet breaking news on your phone.\nDownload\nKeep up with the latest via our app.\nSubscribe\nReceive updates in your inbox.\nMaricela, Montrose\nFeatured CalMatters Member\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel BeckerWater Reporter \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRachel Becker is a journalist reporting on California’s complex water challenges and water policy issues for CalMatters.

Others are keeping ICU patients in crowded emergency rooms. Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera and Fresno are among those in the worst shape.\nWelcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for\xa0WhatMatters\xa0to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.\nAt hospitals in Fresno, critically ill patients with nowhere to go are stuck in crowded emergency rooms.\xa0\nDoctors face such a dire shortage of intensive care beds at Community Regional Medical Center that patients who should be treated in specialized intensive care units were instead filling 12 of its 15 emergency room beds reserved for the severely sick and injured last weekend.\xa0\n“That really bottlenecks us right in the front door,” said Rais Vohra, an emergency medicine physician at Fresno’s Community Regional Medical Center and the county’s interim health officer. “We’re very worried.”\nAt nearby Saint Agnes Medical Center, some non-COVID-19 patients on ventilators have temporarily overflowed into post-operative or emergency department beds as patients with the virus more than quadrupled from 32 to 135 since mid-November.\xa0\nBoth ICUs have reached their capacity, and in all, Fresno County had only nine available ICU beds on Monday for its nearly 1 million residents, according to state data.\n“We are going to have a very hard, very hard winter,” said Jorge Martinez-Cuellar, an internist and medical director of hospital medicine at Saint Agnes Medical Center. “We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\xa0\nAs hospitals throughout California are filling up, dozens of counties are facing staff shortages that prevent them from expanding their ICUs to meet the surge.\nΔ\nNearly two dozen counties had fewer than 10 available ICU beds on Tuesday, and four had all of their ICU beds full, according to state data.\xa0\nWhen comparing available ICU beds to population, Imperial, Kings, San Benito, Madera, Fresno and Yolo counties are in the worst shape. All of them have zero or less than one ICU bed open per 100,000 residents, according to state data.\xa0\nAnother 13 counties have less than three open beds per 100,000 residents: San Bernardino, Riverside, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, San Joaquin, Kern, Lake, Humboldt, Nevada, El Dorado, Solano, Merced and Stanislaus. \nSome hard-hit hospitals are already sending patients to other counties.\xa0\nAt the US-Mexico border, Imperial County has zero ICU beds available for a population of more than 181,000 people,\xa0and as of Dec. 3 had already transferred 37 COVID-positive patients to other counties since mid-November, according to Christopher Herring, county emergency medical services manager.\xa0\n“We’re tired. We’re really getting to the point of lamaze (breathing) our way through the next nine months, having just done nine months,” said Adolphe Edward, CEO of El Centro Regional Medical Center, one of the county’s two hospitals. “It’s like an elephant giving birth after 18 months. It’s going to be exhausting, stretching.”\n“We feel that we are close to what is called a collapse in the system.”\nIn Fresno, Vohra said he has to make difficult decisions about which emergency department patients to admit to the hospital as COVID-19 surges and accidents, shootings, drug overdoses and illnesses continue.\xa0\nLast week, he hesitated to admit an immunosuppressed kidney transplant patient because of the shortage of beds.\xa0\n“That person would have been like a slam dunk admission any other day of the year,” Vohra said, adding that transplant patients are at high risk of potentially lethal sepsis.\xa0\nHe worries that the crowded hospital puts his patient at risk. “Number one, she’s going to be staying in the ER, for probably days, because there’s nowhere to put her. Number two, she may actually catch COVID. I mean, I hate to say that because it’s my hospital. But I have to be realistic.”\nNot enough staff\nCalifornia passed a devastating new milestone this week: More than 11,500 people were hospitalized with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19.\nAnd hospitals are colliding with a major barrier to ramping up ICU care: too few doctors, nurses and others trained to to staff ICUs.\xa0\n“Our hospitals are reporting 5% to 10% of their staff needing to be out, which is really high,” Vohra said. “When you think about a hospital system that has 10,000 employees, that’s 500 to 1000 people that are out.”\xa0\nSome are out because they’re sick. More than 56,600 health care workers have been infected with the novel coronavirus in California since the beginning of the pandemic, and 221 have died, according to state data. In Imperial County, about 10% of the staff tested at El Centro Regional Medical Center have come back positive for the virus, CEO Edward said.\xa0\nOthers are out because they are quarantining after a coronavirus exposure — at work or at home. At Martinez-Cuellar’s hospital in Fresno, 116 staff are under quarantine and 105 of them have tested positive for the virus.\xa0\nSome are struggling with childcare and remote schooling. One emergency department nurse at Kaiser Permanente Oakland Medical Center, who asked not to be named for privacy reasons and because she hadn’t been cleared to talk to the press, said she’s had to cut down on extra shifts to homeschool her children.\xa0\n“I was having to go in the back hallway to try to talk to a teacher of my daughter’s while doing everything else,” she said. “It’s such a juggling act.”\nIn Los Angeles County, state data reports 497 available ICU beds for 10 million people, or less than five per 100,000 population. Some individual hospitals are reaching capacity as the county reported more than 8,500 new cases Tuesday.\xa0\nNearly a quarter of the more than 3,100 people\xa0 in Los Angeles County hospitalized with the novel coronavirus are in the ICU, the county’s public health department reported Tuesday.\nLos Angeles County + USC Medical Center, a county-run teaching hospital serving 10 million people, reached 95% occupancy of its roughly 120 ICU beds on Friday and has been closed to patient transfers, according to spokesperson Connie Castro.\xa0\n“We are full with patients coming to us through the front door,” Castro said in an email to CalMatters. She said the hospital’s ICU reached 100% capacity during the July surge, and is concerned about it happening again. “Nothing about COVID-19 is typical.”\xa0\nLA+USC has space to open another 100 ICU beds, but the limitation is staff.\xa0\n“ICU doctors and nurses are not commodities,” Castro said. “They are precious limited resources, and we cannot just grow more of them in an emergency.”\nTransferring patients out of rural California\nAcross the Central Valley, ICUs are in trouble. In Madera County, they are at 100% capacity, according to the public health department. In San Joaquin County, hospitals are operating at 123% licensed ICU capacity, county EMS specialist Marissa Matta told CalMatters on Monday.\xa0\nIt’s not quite a record high in San Joaquin County — the hospitals hit 149% capacity in July. But, “hospitals are being challenged in a time of year that is normally already very busy,” Matta said.\nSome rural counties without ICUs of their own rely on larger hospitals to take their sickest patients.\xa0\nSince October, Modoc County — wedged into the corner where California, Oregon and Nevada meet — has had to transfer nine especially sick patients to other hospitals in Northern California, Oregon and Nevada, according to Stacy Sphar, the county’s director of health services.\nAnd in Mariposa County, home to the Yosemite Valley, test positivity rate has spiked since the beginning of November to reach 17.1%, about double the state average.

"['L.A. County shatters COVID-19 record with 12,741 new cases in one day\nLos Angeles County shattered its daily record for new coronavirus cases, with 12,741 reported Thursday as hospitals continued to fill with patients, according to an independent Times tally.\nThe new total is more than 2,800 more coronavirus cases than L.A. County has seen in a single day — breaking the previous record set Sunday — and shows the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly through communities. The county also reported 74 new deaths, the fourth-highest single-day total of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe surge in cases likely represents the consequence of an explosion of virus transmission over the Thanksgiving holiday, officials said. \n“I do think that we’re starting to see some of the increases from Thanksgiving week, and the thousands of people that were either traveling or mingling with people outside their household for the holiday,” L.A County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said earlier this week. \nWith the new numbers, L.A. County is now averaging nearly 9,500 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, and 52 COVID-19 deaths a day. Those are both records in this pandemic. Until Thursday, the highest average daily number of COVID-19 deaths in L.A. County over a weekly period was 50, a record set for the seven-day period that ended April 24.\nL.A. County is now recording double the number of daily coronavirus cases than it saw on Nov. 30, and quadruple its daily coronavirus cases since mid-November. Cumulatively, L.A. County has tallied 488,519 coronavirus cases and 8,151 COVID-19 deaths. \nCalifornia has averaged nearly 29,000 new coronavirus cases a day over the last week, a new record. More Californians are also dying of COVID-19 than at any other point in the pandemic. The state has averaged about 150  deaths a day over the last week — breaking a record set in August.\nCalifornia on Thursday recorded 33,995 new coronavirus cases, marking the third highest tally for a single day, and 172 deaths.\nCumulatively, the state has logged more than 1.48 million coronavirus cases and more than 20,600 COVID-19 deaths. \nAt the same time, the availability of intensive care beds in Southern California and the Central Valley hit alarming new lows. \n“Like a speeding car approaching a cliff, if we do not rapidly change course, we are in jeopardy of catastrophic consequences,” Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said during a briefing Thursday. \nIn Southern California, ICU availability fell to 7.7% on Thursday, down from 9% the day before, the latest data show. The state defines the region as Imperial, Inyo, Los Angeles, Mono, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. \nThe situation was even more dire in the San Joaquin Valley region, which is reporting 1.9% ICU availability, down from 4.2%. Numbers have also worsened in the Greater Sacramento area, which reported in at 13.3%, down from 14.3%; and the San Francisco Bay Area, which was at 17.8%, down from 20.9%.\nRural Northern California remains in comparatively solid shape, at 30.3% ICU availability.\nStatewide, an all-time high of 11,497 coronavirus-positive patients were hospitalized as of Wednesday, the most recent day for which complete data are available. \nThat number increased by 485 in just one day and has swelled by 30% over the last week, state figures show. \nThe story is much the same when it comes to ICUs. The number of Californians requiring that level of care jumped 115 in just one day to a record 2,621 as of Wednesday.\nAs of Wednesday, L.A. County had 3,624 people in its hospitals with coronavirus infections, the 11th consecutive day that number has been a new high. The county’s net number of COVID-19 hospitalizations increased overnight between Tuesday and Wednesday by 191 — the highest single-day jump in the pandemic.\nSan Bernardino and Orange counties are the only others that have more than 1,000 coronavirus-positive patients, according to state data. \n California \n Southern California is a main driver of state’s record COVID-19 deaths, with no signs of a letup \nSouthern California and the Central Valley are by far the state’s biggest contributors of total COVID-19 deaths in the last week.\nDec. 10, 2020\nHospitals can take steps to gird themselves against an influx of new patients — by canceling scheduled surgeries and outpatient visits; discharging patients as quickly as possible; and temporarily diverting ambulances with certain types of patients, for instance. \nBut ICU beds require high-tech equipment and specially trained healthcare professionals, which are in high demand throughout the state and nation.\nHealthcare systems can move trained staff around to help plug gaps where needed, but “at a certain point, you run out of options, and that’s what we’re worried about,” Simon said. \n“The worst-case scenario is what we saw back in the spring in New York City and in northern Italy where there were literally people in gurneys in hallways that were dying or near death, and that’s beyond a tragedy,” he said. “It’s just something that we can’t let happen. We have to do everything possible to prevent that.”\n World & Nation \n One-day U.S. death toll from COVID-19 tops 3,000, more than D-Day or 9/11 \nAs officials met to discuss approval of a coronavirus vaccine on Thursday, the number of cases and deaths grew ever more stunning.\nDec. 10, 2020\nThe way the state calculates regional ICU capacity is more complicated “than just looking at how many beds are full at any given point in time,” said Ferrer.\nShe said Wednesday that the state had set a threshold that only 30% of ICU beds should be occupied by COVID-19 patients and that, should an area exceed that, “they make a downward adjustment — sort of, you get a penalty.”\nThe California Department of Public Health elaborated in response to an inquiry from The Times Thursday: “If a region is utilizing more than 30% of its ICU beds for COVID-19 positive patients, then its available ICU capacity is reduced by 0.5% for each 1% over the 30% threshold. This is done to preserve the capacity of the ICU to also treat non-COVID-19 conditions.”\n“The ICU is an important tool to save lives for those with COVID-19 and other critical medical conditions such as cancer, heart attacks and strokes,” the department statement continued. “If a disproportionate number of ICU beds are being utilized to treat COVID-19 patients, then patients with non-COVID medical issues may not be receiving or be able to receive the level of care they need.”\nAccording to data provided by Los Angeles County, 47% of the region’s intensive care beds were filled with COVID-19 patients as of Tuesday. That’s a significant cause for alarm, officials said.\n“We’re always going to need ICU beds for those many other conditions and so there is greater concern if, in addition to seeing a reduced overall capacity, we’re seeing a greater proportion of these ICU beds taken up by COVID-19 patients,” Simon said.\nHow California determines ICU availability is of keen interest, as that’s the metric the state uses to determine whether to hand down additional restrictions on businesses and activities. \nThe state is implementing new stay-at-home orders in any region that sees its ICU capacity drop below 15%.\nThose orders — which reduce capacity at retail stores; close businesses including hair salons, nail salons, card rooms, museums, zoos and aquariums; and prohibit outdoor restaurant dining — are already in place in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley.\nThose restrictions will also go into effect in Greater Sacramento beginning Thursday night.\nOfficials have said they hope the additional restrictions will help stymie the latest coronavirus surge. \nGiven how widespread the virus is in communities up and down the state, experts say the best thing residents can do to keep themselves and their loved ones from being infected is to stay home as much as possible over the next few weeks.\n“To be blunt, we have one chance to turn this serious surge around, and that chance is right now,” San Francisco health director Dr. Grant Colfax said this week. “But our window is narrowing and closing fast.”\nWith grim case counts, officials have pointed to the relief a vaccine will soon bring as a way to encourage people to continue to maintain precautions.\nFerrer announced earlier this week that the county would likely get its first doses of the coronavirus vaccine as early as next week. During a Thursday  news conference, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said that as many as 500,000 doses may be distributed by the end of December.\n“Vaccines will be our most important tool in getting this crisis under control,” he said. “FDA authorization will mean that it’s safe and that it’s effective, and I urge all Angelenos to get vaccinated as soon as they qualify and those vaccines are available.”\nHe urged residents, however, to continue to stay at home as much as possible, stating that “the worst is not yet behind us.”\nTimes staff writers Maura Dolan, Ryan Menezes and Leila Miller contributed to this report. \nMore to Read \n ‘A huge burden’: L.A. hospitals strained by COVID surge, very bad flu season \nDec. 8, 2022\n Another bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Staying home and preventing coronavirus infections will help hospitals manage the influx of patients. As officials wait and hope for the stay-at-home order to tame the surge, they are anxiously tracking ICU capacity.\nAdvertisement\nHere’s what you need to know about ICU capacity and why it’s important at this stage of the pandemic.\nFive things you need to know about COVID-19\nUPDATED\xa0Oct. 2, 2020 | 5:15 PM\nWhat are the symptoms of COVID-19?\nA lot of them are the same as symptoms of a cold or the flu: cough, sore throat, congestion or a runny nose, fatigue, muscle or body aches, fever or chills, and shortness of breath. A person with COVID-19 may also experience diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, or a new loss of taste or smell. In cases of serious illness, it can take time for symptoms to worsen.\nHow long does it take for symptoms to appear after a person is exposed to the coronavirus?\nThe first symptoms can appear in as few as two days, but it can also take as long as two weeks, according to the CDC. An incubation period of four or five days is more typical. However, a significant proportion of people who are infected — perhaps as much as 45% — never develop any symptoms, researchers say.\nWhat should I do if I think I'm infected?\nIf you have symptoms of COVID-19 or you’ve been in close contact with someone who has it, the CDC recommends that you get a coronavirus test. Until you get your test results, you should assume you are infected. That means staying at home as much as possible so that you don’t risk infecting others. Of course, if you’re having a medical emergency, don’t be afraid to call 911.  \nSome diagnostic tests look for genetic evidence of the virus in a sample of saliva or a specimen collected from the nose or throat. Others can detect specific coronavirus molecules that prompt the immune system to produce infection-fighting antibodies.\nHow can I reduce my risk of infection?\nLimit contact with people outside of your household. When you do go out, wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth and stay at least six feet away from others whenever possible. Clean your hands frequently by using soap and water for 20 seconds or a sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are dirty. At home, clean and disinfect tables, doorknobs, faucets and other frequently touched surfaces once a day.\nHow did the pandemic start?\nScientists think it began with a close relative of the novel coronavirus that has been circulating in bats and other animals for so long that it no longer makes them sick. That virus must have gained a key mutation that allowed it to infect humans. Health officials in China reported the first cases of the respiratory illness that came to be known as COVID-19 in December 2019. The first known case in Los Angeles was in January. California has had more than 800,000 confirmed cases since.\nWhat is an ICU?\nAn ICU, or intensive care unit, is a specialized hospital department that cares for people in the most critical health situations, such as those with life-threatening injuries or severe illnesses. ICUs are equipped with specialized equipment, such as ventilators.\nMost important, ICUs are staffed with highly trained nurses and physicians who provide round-the-clock care to their patients — checking their breathing, blood pressure, fluids and other vital signs. Dr. Shruti Gohil, an infectious disease specialist at UCI Health, said there is a 1-to-1 ratio of nurses to patients in ICUs.\nAdvertisement\n“That kind of minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour care requires a level of training on the nurses to ... recognize problems quickly and address them quickly and then know what needs to be done while waiting,” Gohil said.\nA COVID-19 patient with severe difficulty breathing may require ventilator support in an ICU.\n“We are responding at the moment to a tsunami of COVID-19 patients in the hospital,” said Carmela Coyle, president and chief executive of the California Hospital Assn. “But that does not stop the heart attacks, the strokes, the cancer patients with serious, immediate needs.”\nAdvertisement\nWhat is ICU capacity?\nCapacity is the number of staffed beds available at a point in time.\nDetermining whether capacity has been reached is more nebulous.\nThe state determines a region’s ICU capacity with a weighted formula to ensure that some ICU beds remain open for non-COVID patients. When the state says a region has reached 0%, it may actually still have some beds available. Individual counties, such as Fresno, have reported having no open ICU beds.\nCapacity also fluctuates as patients exit the ICU and others enter.\n“There’s always sort of this movement that’s not always quite captured by the snapshots that we get,” said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County. “Overall, the capacity is severely impacted.”\nWhat happens when an ICU reaches 0% capacity?\nHospitals will likely place patients in open beds elsewhere in the hospital, such as emergency department rooms.\nHaving open beds in other parts of the hospital does not mean a hospital is equipped to handle more intensive care patients. Dr. Bill Stringer, chief pulmonologist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Torrance, said the “limiting step is not going to be space or equipment. It’s going to be staff.”\nBecause of their specialized training in high-intensity situations, ICU medical professionals are scarce resources.\n\nCalifornia\nHere’s what the ICU ward looks like with 0% availability\nICU availability in Southern California at 0%, and the crisis is expected to get worse, officials warn.\nDec. 21, 2020\n“The problem is, we’ve got a nationwide shortage of critical care nurses,” Coyle said. “It is not the case where you can pull any nurse into the ICU to provide that level of care.”\nAdvertisement\nAnd when ICUs are stretched beyond capacity, the quality of care can decline and mortality rates can rise.\nAs ICU capacity shrinks, a hospital is likely to scale back elective procedures, freeing up staff. Some healthcare workers — such as those who work in trauma, surgery and anesthesia — are already trained for high-stress scenarios, so they would be “natural pivots” to the ICU, Gohil said. A critical care professional would supervise.\n“In a poor, catastrophic state, it would be an all-hands-on-deck approach,” Gohil said.\nIf a hospital’s beds fill, some patients may be transferred to neighboring hospitals. But moving ICU patients is risky, Stringer said.\n“Just imagine somebody who is just completely inert, that is sedated, that is being supported at least with a ventilator,” Stringer said. “It’s the most fragile and vulnerable patient being transferred. That’s a very difficult decision.”\nHow do I find out the ICU capacity where I live?\nThe state keeps an updated list of ICU bed availability by county.\nHospitals report their capacities daily, and the state tallies them.\nHere are the regional numbers as of Thursday afternoon:\n\nSouthern California: 7.7%, down from 9% Wednesday\nSan Joaquin Valley: 1.9%, down from 4.2%\nGreater Sacramento: 13.3%, down from 14.3%\nBay Area: 17.8%, down from 20.9%\nNorthern California: 30.3%, an improvement from 27.1%\n\nI live in a region where ICU space is at capacity, but I have a medical emergency. What do I do?\nYou should still seek help. If you’re in a serious emergency, call 911.\nAdvertisement\nOtherwise, Stringer said, call the hospital emergency departments near you to check their capacity. Then wear a mask and go.\n“The hospital, even though we have plenty of COVID patients, is still a safe place to get care,” Stringer said. “It’s probably not as safe as being on a backpacking trip in the Rockies. But if you’ve got an emergency, you need to call.”\nMore to Read\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s new coronavirus wave is disrupting lives, even with less severe illness\nJune 1, 2022\n*    \nAnother bummer coronavirus summer for California?

Seven state hospitals were given ""D"" grades and one hospital earned an ""F"" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe ""F"" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago\'s requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a ""C"" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere\'s what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got ""D"" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was ""due to an increase in hospital acquired infections"" during earlier reporting periods. \n""Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,"" a spokesperson said. ""Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities."" \nVista Health System said it ""improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients’ experience"" but noted that data used in its grade ""is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista’s physicians, nurses, and staff.""\n""Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista’s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a \'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus\' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,"" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a ""robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.""\n""We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don’t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,"" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the ""C"" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine\'s Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital ""is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care."" \n""Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,"" the hospital said in a statement. ""We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\xa0Leapfrog\xa0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.""\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B\'s. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n“OSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,"" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an ""A"" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an ""A"" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere\'s a look at which Illinois hospitals received an ""A"" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth\'s Hospital - O\'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary\'s Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n']","In May 2023, how many more U.S. community hospitals were there compared to the combined number of hospitals in Illinois that received 'A' and 'B' grades in the Fall 2021 safety report?","def solve():
