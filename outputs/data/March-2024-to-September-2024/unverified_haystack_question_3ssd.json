      "Federal funds rate history: 1990 to today\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach. Katherine holds an MBA, and is a former staff writer for Fit Small Business. She is a regular contributor to Forbes and maintains a popular lifestyle and travel blog.\nAbigail Rueger is a deputy editor on the banking team at Fortune Recommends. She is passionate about personal finance and offering consumers actionable steps for making positive life changes. Prior to joining Fortune, Abigail spent four years as an editor for Choosing Therapy, a startup dedicated to providing the best mental health information on the web.\u00a0\nSet by the Federal Reserve\u2014or the \u2018Fed\u2019\u2014the federal funds rate helps stabilize the economy during growth and recession. In recent decades, the Fed\u2019s choice to raise or lower rates has been in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis of 2008. \nKnowing how and why the Fed changes these rates can help you better understand how their decisions affect everyday Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding Fed Interest Rate Decisions\nThink of the federal fund rate as a thermostat for the economy. When the economy begins to overheat\u2014shown by rising inflation and unsustainable growth\u2014the Fed raises the \u2018temperature\u2019 by increasing interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. \nConversely, during a recession, or when the economy starts to \u2018freeze,\u2019 the Fed lowers the thermostat by cutting rates, encouraging borrowing and spending to help warm things back up.\u00a0\nThe federal funds rate helps maintain the economy\u2019s \u2018temperature\u2019\u2014not too hot, not too cold. It influences everything from mortgage rates to consumer spending.\nExpert insight\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have a direct impact on consumers and businesses. When rates rise, borrowing costs go up, meaning your mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and business debt can become more expensive. On the flip side, lower rates make it cheaper to borrow, which can help with big purchases like homes, cars, and business expansion.But it\u2019s not all bad news when rates go up\u2014savers benefit from higher returns on cash in savings accounts, CDs, and bonds, allowing their money to earn more interest. Whether you\u2019re borrowing or saving, Fed rate changes ripple through the economy and affect your financial well-being in a number of ways.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tudor, CFP, CAP \u2013 Investment Advisor\nDrawbacks of interest rate decisions by the Fed\nThe Fed\u2019s policies, though aimed at stabilizing the broader economy, often have unintended side effects. Jason Ray, president and chief information officer (CIO) of Zenith Wealth Partners, says, \u201cWhile necessary, the Fed\u2019s actions often disproportionately benefit financial markets and asset holders, raising questions about long-term wealth inequality under its policies. \nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act often amplifies existing socioeconomic divides, especially when rate changes disproportionately impact borrowers or savers across different income levels. Is the focus on employment and inflation inadvertently deepening these structural inequalities?\u201d\nWhat impacts the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process?\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 members\u2014seven from the Board of Governors and five from regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014who meet regularly to take a closer look at economic indicators. They use these indicators to help make decisions about monetary policy, such as whether or not to change the federal funds rate.\nThe key indicators that the Fed monitors are:\nThe role of the \u201cdot plot\u201d and forward guidance\nIn addition to current economic data, the FOMC also considers future expectations, known as the \u2018dot plot.\u2019 All twelve FOMC members submit their future projections for short- and long-term interest rates. This can help gauge the committee\u2019s views on the future of the economy and help guide the Fed\u2019s overall strategy.\u00a0\nForward guidance also helps the Fed signal future intentions. By communicating whether rates will go up or down in the near future, the Fed can guide future market behavior, aiming to provide some stability for the market. For example, if the Fed says rates are likely to stay low for a long time, a business might be more likely to invest because they know borrowing rates will be affordable.\u00a0\nThe Fed must balance economic growth while keeping inflation in check. It does this by making data-driven decisions based on factors like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior. In addition to these indicators, there are other considerations, like trade tensions, global events, and geopolitical risks. For example, the pandemic, the 2008 financial meltdown, and wars impacted the Fed\u2019s decisions.\nThe FOMC\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t safe from scrutiny\u2014they face this from the public, political leaders, and markets. Because the Federal Reserve is independent, it can focus on the economy\u2019s long-term health without the interference of short-term political pressure. However, its decisions have far-reaching effects on businesses, consumers, and the entire global economy.\nThe global influence of federal funds rate changes\nDecisions made by the Fed affect more than just the United States. In fact, they can impact the economy, markets, and central banks worldwide. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and when the Fed makes policies, it also shapes global financial conditions.\u00a0\nWhen rates are raised or cut, there\u2019s a global chain reaction impacting everything from international trade to exchange rates to capital flows and foreign investment:\n2022-2024: Fed rate hikes & cuts\nThe Fed\u2019s rate policy from 2022 to 2024 marks a dramatic swing between aggressive hikes and easing measures. In 2022 and 2023, they raised rates at an unprecedented pace to cool the economy after supply chain issues and high consumer demand. By late 2023, rampant inflation showed signs of easing.\u00a0\nThen, at their meeting on September 18th, 2024, they enacted their first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic\u201450 basis points to help the weak labor market.\u00a0\nBy cutting rates in 2024, the Fed addressed concerns about slow economic growth, as well as rising unemployment. To prevent further deterioration of job gains and rising unemployment rates, the Fed aims to make borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments and spending, which can help create more jobs and stimulate the economy while keeping inflation manageable.\n2019-2020: Fed rate cuts\nGoing into 2020, the Fed cut rates to help stimulate the economy amidst global uncertainty. The end of 2019 marked concerns about trade tensions, with slow global growth and muted inflation, which prompted them to cut rates. But then the pandemic hit, causing them to shift from caution to emergency action. When the world shut down in March of 2020, in an unprecedented move to support the economy, the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero.\u00a0\nPaired with quantitative easing to mitigate any economic fallout once businesses started boarding up and unemployment soared, the Fed's actions were designed to flood the financial system with liquidity and encourage borrowing and spending. Cutting rates to almost zero, businesses could borrow for much cheaper than before, and allowed for consumers to finance large purchases.\u00a0\n2015-2018: Fed rate hikes\nIn the wake of near-zero rates after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since 2006. They were confident the US economy was starting to recover, thanks to steady job growth and more consumer spending. While these rate hikes were modest, they were scant for a reason: After years of extraordinary measures, they wanted to normalize the monetary policy. Then, by 2018, they'd raised the rates four times as the economy strengthened.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, a volatile market led to a more cautious stance by the Fed as trade tensions and slow global growth raised concerns about the sustainability of the economic expansion. Worried that the rate hikes could stifle any growth and propel the US into a deeper economic dive, they hit pause on tightening the economy.\n2007-2008: Fed rate cuts\nFinancial markets unraveled when the housing bubble burst, causing the Fed to make sharp rate cuts in 2007 and 2008. These were supposed to help cushion the U.S. economy amid the subprime mortgage crisis, but the response was a full-blown global financial meltdown.\u00a0\nThe Fed brought rates to near zero after cutting them from over 5% by the end of 2008. Amid bailouts and emergency lending to stabilize banks, they sought to prevent a deeper economic collapse. This period became known as The Great Recession.\u00a0\u00a0\n2005-2006: Fed rate hikes\nTo prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates in the mid-2000s. The economy was expanding and housing prices were surging, so the Fed made a series of rate hikes from 2005 to 2006. With potential speculation in the housing market and increasing inflation, the Fed sought to curb excessive borrowing and prevent the formation of asset bubbles by steadily raising interest rates. By December 2005, they'd raised rates for 13 straight times.\nThis made borrowing more expensive, which cooled the housing market and brought rising prices under control during this period of economic instability that ran rampant with unchecked inflation and speculative activity.\u00a0\n2001-2003: Fed rate cuts\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Reserve had a lot to contend with\u2014the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the aftermath of September 11th. From 2001 to 2003, the Fed made a series of rate cuts to help stimulate an economy rocked by back-to-back crises. They slashed rates from 6.5% to 1% during this period to support growth and encourage more borrowing and investments. In 2001 alone, they cut rates 11 times.\nWhile these extended periods of rate cuts helped the economic slowdown, they also contributed to the eventual housing market bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008.\n1999-2000: Fed rate hikes\nWith a growing technology sector and booming economic growth, the Fed raised rates in 1999 and 2000. This helped to control inflation, especially as tech stocks experienced rapid growth. They raised rates five times between 1999 and 2000 to prevent overheating the economy. However, with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the following economic downturn, they shifted to cutting rates shortly afterward.\n1998: Fed rate cuts\nWith growing concerns over the global financial system, the Fed made a series of rate cuts in 1998. A major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, collapsed around the same time as serious instability in worldwide markets, influenced by the Asian financial crisis. The Fed's aim was to prevent the US from sinking into a recession. Totaling 75 basis points, the three rate cuts helped stabilize the markets.\nThe Fed made these cuts to encourage borrowing and investments, and by the end of 1998, the economy was relatively strong despite what was happening in external markets. However, some economists suggest that this period of extended rate cuts helped contribute to the dot-com bubble bust in the following years.\n1997: Fed rate hike\nIn 1997, the Fed raised rates in response to strong economic growth and a tightening labor market. Unemployment fell to historic lows, and when inflationary pressure increased, the Fed hiked rates to prevent overheating the economy. While they wanted to keep the stock market rising and bolster the ongoing expansion, the Fed also had to keep inflation in check.\u00a0\nThey made just one rate increase in 1997 to maintain price stability and consumer confidence. Throughout the decade, they were careful to balance growth and inflationary pressures.\n1995-1996: Fed rate cuts\nThe U.S. saw an economic expansion following the 1990s recession, so the Fed cut rates in 1995 and 1996. Earlier in the decade, the Fed grew concerned that the economy was slowing, partly due to reduced inflationary pressure. They wanted to encourage borrowing and investing so the economy could expand even further. These cuts kept inflation under control and helped reignite growth.\nThis ushered the economy into continued prosperity in the late 1990s, thanks to steady growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. However, critics argue that these low rates led to riskier financial markets that led to the dot-com bubble.\n1994-1995: Fed rate hikes\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve went on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 1994. With rapid economic expansion and more inflationary pressure, the federal funds rate jumped from 3% to 6% between February 1994 and February 1995. This was to prevent the economy from overheating and curb inflation, especially as wages increased and the labor market tightened.\nWhile these hikes controlled inflation, they also slowed the economy down, especially as sectors like housing and manufacturing, which are more sensitive to interest rates, saw reduced demand due to higher borrowing costs. These made loans more expensive, so home sales dropped and industrial production slowed, leading to even more economic deceleration. By early 1995, the Fed paused these rate increases to help maintain long-term stability, which fueled the expansion in the late 1990s.\n1990-1992: Fed rate cuts\nA recession began in 1990, and to stimulate the economy, the Fed made a series of rate cuts. The savings and loan crisis, Gulf War oil prices, and slowing consumer spending combined to trigger this recession. The Fed brought the federal funds rate from 8% to 3% over a two-year period to help encourage borrowing and investing in a sluggish economy.\nThis laid the groundwork for the economic recovery experienced by the mid-90s, as it was cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow, so they were encouraged to spend more. Industries reliant on consumer credit, such as the real estate market, benefited from these lower rates. This gradual economic recovery took some time to come to fruition, though many agree the Fed's actions helped prevent a deeper, more prolonged recession.\nThe takeaway\nThe federal fund rate's history shows the tough balancing act that the Fed employs to sustain economic growth while controlling inflation. During periods of rapid growth, rate hikes help curb inflation, while during economic slowdowns, rate cuts help stimulate borrowing.\u00a0\nAs a consumer and investor, knowing when and why the Federal Reserve makes adjustments to the federal funds rates can help you decide when to borrow, invest, and save. For example, if rates are high, you might want to wait to refinance your mortgage, but it might be an excellent time to stash some cash in a high-yield savings account or CD.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\nThe Federal Reserve oversees the United States' monetary policy as the central banking system. It regulates financial institutions, works to maintain economic stability, and manages the nation's money supply.\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\nThe Federal Reserve controls interest rates, works to keep inflation in check, and tries to stabilize the financial system. It also supervises banks, provides financial services to the US government, and is a lender during financial crises.\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\nThe Federal Reserve was formed in 1913 to provide a more stable banking system and to help stem financial panics like the one that caused the Panic of 1907. This saw widespread bank runs and deteriorated confidence in the economic system. This central authority to manage monetary policy and give emergency support to banks helped create a more resilient financial environment.\nRead more\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach.

      "Golden State Warriors\nCharlotte Hornets\nStephen Curry returns home, scores 23 points to lead Warriors past Hornets 115-97\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Stephen Curry scored 23 points with four 3-pointers in his annual homecoming game and the Golden State Warriors beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-97 on Friday night for their third straight win.\n              Curry, who grew up here and starred at nearby Davidson College before entering the NBA draft as a first-round pick in 2009, had 12 points in the pivotal third quarter as the Warriors blew open a close game.\n              Curry has always relished returning to play in Charlotte and seeing family and old friends, but the previous four games here have resulted in losses.\n              \u201cAt this stage (of my career) I can probably count on one hand how many times I get to come back here,\" Curry said. \u201cIt was nice seeing a lot of familiar faces in the crowd. And, it was nice to actually get a win.\u201d\n Andrew Wiggins had a big role in that, turning in another strong game with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points for the Warriors, who are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and battling the Houston Rockets for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Rockets won their 11th straight, 101-100 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night and are a game behind the Warriors.\n Fred VanVleet had 22 points, Amen Thompson added 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jabari Smith, Jr. scored 14 points for the Rocke\n              Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that is a reflection of just how tough the West is this season.\n              \u201cWe had a similar record last year and we were the sixth seed,\u201d Kerr said.\n              Golden State limited Charlotte to 41% shooting and held its third straight opponent to fewer than 100 points.\n              \u201cI feel like we are starting out the game engaged on the floor and talking, and that has carried over,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n Miles Bridges had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Charlotte, which failed in its bid to win back-to-back games for the first time since the All-Star break.\n              Curry always packs the Spectrum Center and Friday night was no exception.\n              With his brother Seth and father Dell looking on, Curry finished the game 9 of 18 from the field. Seth plays for Charlotte but is out with an ankle injury, while Dell is a broadcaster for the Hornets.\n              Curry admitted there has always been a \"curiosity\" about playing for the Hornets, where his father was a star but said his intentions are to remain in the Bay Area.\n              Charlotte rookie Brandon Miller briefly left the game with 8 1/2 minutes left after his leg got tangled up with Draymond Green while going for a rebound. He had just 12 points after making a career-high seven 3s and scoring 31 points on Monday night.\n              Green, who was ejected from the Warriors last game against Orlando, was later whistled for a foul when he appeared to push Charlotte\u2019s Grant Williams to the ground. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but the play was upheld.\n              The Warriors had no problems scoring against the Hornets, repeatedly taking advantage of breakdowns by Charlotte\u2019s defense, finding wide open players underneath the basket on three different occasions.\n              \u201cTrayce (Jackson-Davis) did a great job on the boards today, gave them second opportunities, and with the Warriors, you can\u2019t do that with everybody on their team who can shoot,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey were making shots, they were cutting hard and they were getting second-chance points.\u201d \n              The Warriors played without Klay Thompson, who sat out with tendinitis in his right knee.\n Chris Paul got the start in his place and had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, including a lob over three players to Jackson-Davis for a dunk.\n              Jackson-Davis said Paul thought he threw the ball over his head.\n              \u201cI had some sneaky bunnies and I went up and got it,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n              UP NEXT\n              Warriors: Visit Spurs on Sunday night.\n              Hornets: Host Clippers on Sunday night.\n              ----\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\nRegular Season Series\nGame Information\n2024-25 Pacific Standings\n2024-25 Southeast Standings\nNBA News\nToronto takes on Charlotte for conference matchup\nWashington takes on conference foe Atlanta\nPhiladelphia and Detroit square off in conference showdown\n"
