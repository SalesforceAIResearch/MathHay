Volatility : 53.17% (As of Oct. 29, 2024)\nView and export this data going back to 2010. Start your Free Trial\nWhat is Tesla Volatility?\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index, it shows how the price swings around its mean. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\n\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\n\nTesla's Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\n\u03c3A=\u03c3M*\u221a12=\u221a 1/(n-1) \u2211(Ri - R')^2*\u221a12\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD.\n* For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\n\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA) Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\n\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.\nContacts\nInvestors:\nKenneth Dorell\ninvestor@meta.com\u00a0/ investor.fb.com\nPress:\nRyan Moore\npress@meta.com\u00a0/ about.fb.com/news/\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements regarding our future business plans and expectations. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

      "Get focused newsletters especially designed to be concise and easy to digest\nSea Level Rise Projection Map \u2013 Miami\nMiami is notoriously vulnerable to sea level rise, and its mayor has been vocal about the looming dangers of climate change in a relatively skeptical political environment. Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.

      "Get focused newsletters especially designed to be concise and easy to digest\nSea Level Rise Projection Map \u2013 Miami\nMiami is notoriously vulnerable to sea level rise, and its mayor has been vocal about the looming dangers of climate change in a relatively skeptical political environment. Mitigation plans involve massive engineering feats that may help in the short-term, but will eventually be overrun.\nEarth.Org takes a closer look.\n\u2014\nA major centre of finance, commerce, culture, arts and trade, Miami is a global city with a USD $345 billion GDP. Built on a broad, low-lying plain between Everglades wetlands and Biscayne Bay, its citizens are already experiencing early signs of climate change.\nWhy?\nSince 1870, global sea levels have risen by an average of 20 cm, but Southeast Florida\u2019s local levels have risen by 30 cm. By 2060, it could double or triple that.\u00a0\nThe impacts of sea level rise in Miami\nIn light of the last point, officials have decided to build a network of huge pumps that force water out of flood-prone areas and into Biscayne Bay. There are over 30 pumps today, with 90 planned in total. The estimated cost for 3 pumps, including land acquisition, is USD $ 200 million. Unfortunately, even all 90 cannot protect the larger Miami area.\u00a0\nThe city of Miami still toils away to mitigate flooding, raising roads and buildings, hoping to buy time. The world would do well to keep an eye on how Miami fares, as it may be the first major victim of climate change.\nEarth.Org has mapped severe flooding in southern Florida by the end of the century to illustrate the impending danger.\nSea Level Rise: Miami\u2019s Map\nSea level rise projections by 2100 for two scenarios with the amount of rise in meters indicated (mild = 1m; extreme = 4m). Percentage and total population displacement indicated bottom right, yellow star on the city of Miami.\nMethodology\nGlobal mean sea level is projected to rise by 2m at the end of this century. However, in order to determine local sea level rise (SLR), one has to take into account local coastal flood levels which could be 2.8m above Mean Higher-High Water (MHHW) at extreme forecasts. These local levels bring variability to the projected SLR from 1m to 6.5m (eg. Rio vs Kolkata).\nThe SLR scenarios used in this study are based on the forecasts from Climate Central \u2013 Coastal Risk Screening Tool \u00a0with the following parameters:\nSea level Projection Source:\nFrom two highly cited journals by Kopp et al., estimating SLR mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt. The mid-range scenario projected 0.5-1.2m of SLR based on different representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the IPCC. While the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice-sheet melting, estimating SLR at 1m-2.5m in 2100, with a projection of 10m SLR at 2300.\nCoastal Flooding\nMore frequent coastal flooding is a direct impact of sea-level rise. Based on the Global tides and surge reanalysis by Muis et al., (2016), it is estimated that the extreme coastal water level could be from 0.2 \u2013 2.8m over the mean level. While in extreme cases like China and the Netherlands it could experience 5-10m of extreme sea levels. Here, the coastal local flood level is added on top of the projected SLR.\nPollution Scenario:\nAllows choosing the RCP, the greenhouse gas concentration trajectory defined by the IPCC.\u00a0 The mild level is based on RCP4.5, of 2\u00b0C temperature rise; while the Extreme level is based on RCP 8.5, of 4\u00b0C temperature rise.\nLuck:\nApplies to the baseline SLR, defined in the \u201cSea level projection\u201d section, upon which we add flooding. \u201cMild\u201d refers to the mid-range scenario of 0.5-1.2m, and \u201cextreme\u201d to the pessimistic scenario of 1-2.5m. We used the high-end value of each scenario (mild = 1m; extreme = 2.5m).\nYou might also like: Sea Level Rise by 2100 \u2013 New York City\nA Graphical History of Atmospheric CO2 Levels Over Time\n11 Interesting Climate Change Facts\nThe Statistics of Biodiversity Loss [2020 WWF Report]\nHand-picked stories weekly or monthly.
