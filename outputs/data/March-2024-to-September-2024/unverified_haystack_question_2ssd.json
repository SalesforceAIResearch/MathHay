To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.

History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.\nKey Points\n\nSNPINDEX: ^GSPC\n\nS&P 500 Index\nThe stock market had an unexpectedly good September, and momentum could carry the S&P 500 higher in the fourth quarter.\nSeptember has historically been the weakest month of the year for the U.S. stock market. In the last two decades, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.27%) has declined by an average of 0.6% during September, which is a half-percentage point worse than the next closest month.\nThat inexplicable phenomenon, aptly known as the \"September Effect,\" failed to materialize this year. Instead, the S&P 500 advanced 2% to clench its best September since 2013. And history says that momentum spill into the remaining months of 2024.\nHere's what investors should know.\nHistory says the S&P 500 is headed higher in the remaining months of 2024\nThe U.S. stock market's unexpectedly strong September was a product of solid financial results and interest rate cuts. Specifically, S&P 500 companies recorded earnings growth of 11.3% in the second quarter of 2024, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years. Lower rates should strengthen the economy by encouraging consumer spending and business investments, which itself should drive continued strength in corporate earnings.\nEnthusiasm born of those events pushed the S&P 500 higher in September, something that has happened only 11 other times in the last two decades. The chart below shows how the index performed over the three-month and 12-month periods following positive Septembers in the past.\nYear\n3-Month Return\n12-Month Return\n2004\n9%\n10%\n2005\n2%\n9%\n2006\n6%\n14%\n2007\n(4%)\n(24%)\n2009\n5%\n(26%)\n2010\n10%\n(1%)\n2012\n(1%)\n17%\n2013\n10%\n17%\n2017\n(1%)\n16%\n2018\n(14%)\n2%\n2019\n9%\n13%\nMedian\n5%\n10%\nData source: YCharts. The chart shows the S&P 500's performance during the three-month period and 12-month period following a positive return in September of the listed year.\nAs shown above, during the last two decades, the S&P 500 has achieved a median three-month return of 5% and a median 12-month return of 10% following a positive result in September. We can use that information to make an educated guess about the current situation.\nSpecifically, the S&P 500 has fallen 1% since the end of September. That leaves implied upside of 6% over the next three months and 11% over the next 12 months. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but those predictions are very plausible.\nThe fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of the year for the stock market due to the expectation that holiday spending will help the economy. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.3% in the fourth quarter, more than doubling its performance in the next best quarter, according to Carson Group.\nAdditionally, the S&P 500 advanced 193% in the last decade, excluding dividends. That equates to 11.3% annually. So, an 11% return during the next 12-month period that ends in September 2025 would actually qualify as below average. Regardless, investors should be cautious in the current market environment.\nThe S&P 500 could be derailed by historically expensive stock prices\nMany stocks are expensive by historical standards. The S&P 500 trades at 27 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.8 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.7 times earnings. As a result, several Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline in the remaining months of 2024.\nThe chart below lists Wall Street's year-end price targets for the S&P 500. It also shows the implied upside or downside (compared to its current level of 5,710) associated with each forecast.\nWall Street Firm\nS&P 500 Year-End Target\nImplied Upside (Downside)\nBMO Capital Markets\n6,100\n7%\nEvercore\n6,000\n5%\nOppenheimer\n5,900\n3%\nYardeni Research\n5,800\n2%\nDeutsche Bank\n5,750\n1%\nRBC Capital\n5,700\n0%\nUBS\n5,600\n(2%)\nCiti\n5,600\n(2%)\nGoldman Sachs\n5,600\n(2%)\nBarclays\n5,600\n(2%)\nWells Fargo\n5,535\n(3%)\nBank of America\n5,400\n(5%)\nFundstrat\n5,200\n(9%)\nJPMorgan Chase\n4,200\n(26%)\nMedian\n5,200\n(2%)\nData source: Yahoo Finance.\nAs shown above, Wall Street's year-end targets for the S&P 500 imply outcomes ranging from 7% upside to 26% downside in the remaining months of 2024. But the median forecast of 5,600 implies 2% downside.\nHere's the bottom line: History says the S&P 500 will have a strong fourth quarter. But stocks are historically expensive, so the first sign of economic trouble could trigger a market correction or even a bear market. So, investors should be particularly cognizant of valuations when buying stocks in the current environment.\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

It influences everything from mortgage rates to consumer spending.\nExpert insight\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have a direct impact on consumers and businesses. When rates rise, borrowing costs go up, meaning your mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and business debt can become more expensive. On the flip side, lower rates make it cheaper to borrow, which can help with big purchases like homes, cars, and business expansion.But it\u2019s not all bad news when rates go up\u2014savers benefit from higher returns on cash in savings accounts, CDs, and bonds, allowing their money to earn more interest. Whether you\u2019re borrowing or saving, Fed rate changes ripple through the economy and affect your financial well-being in a number of ways.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tudor, CFP, CAP \u2013 Investment Advisor\nDrawbacks of interest rate decisions by the Fed\nThe Fed\u2019s policies, though aimed at stabilizing the broader economy, often have unintended side effects. Jason Ray, president and chief information officer (CIO) of Zenith Wealth Partners, says, \u201cWhile necessary, the Fed\u2019s actions often disproportionately benefit financial markets and asset holders, raising questions about long-term wealth inequality under its policies. \nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act often amplifies existing socioeconomic divides, especially when rate changes disproportionately impact borrowers or savers across different income levels. Is the focus on employment and inflation inadvertently deepening these structural inequalities?\u201d\nWhat impacts the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process?\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 members\u2014seven from the Board of Governors and five from regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014who meet regularly to take a closer look at economic indicators. They use these indicators to help make decisions about monetary policy, such as whether or not to change the federal funds rate.\nThe key indicators that the Fed monitors are:\nThe role of the \u201cdot plot\u201d and forward guidance\nIn addition to current economic data, the FOMC also considers future expectations, known as the \u2018dot plot.\u2019 All twelve FOMC members submit their future projections for short- and long-term interest rates. This can help gauge the committee\u2019s views on the future of the economy and help guide the Fed\u2019s overall strategy.\u00a0\nForward guidance also helps the Fed signal future intentions. By communicating whether rates will go up or down in the near future, the Fed can guide future market behavior, aiming to provide some stability for the market. For example, if the Fed says rates are likely to stay low for a long time, a business might be more likely to invest because they know borrowing rates will be affordable.\u00a0\nThe Fed must balance economic growth while keeping inflation in check. It does this by making data-driven decisions based on factors like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior. In addition to these indicators, there are other considerations, like trade tensions, global events, and geopolitical risks. For example, the pandemic, the 2008 financial meltdown, and wars impacted the Fed\u2019s decisions.\nThe FOMC\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t safe from scrutiny\u2014they face this from the public, political leaders, and markets. Because the Federal Reserve is independent, it can focus on the economy\u2019s long-term health without the interference of short-term political pressure. However, its decisions have far-reaching effects on businesses, consumers, and the entire global economy.\nThe global influence of federal funds rate changes\nDecisions made by the Fed affect more than just the United States. In fact, they can impact the economy, markets, and central banks worldwide. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and when the Fed makes policies, it also shapes global financial conditions.\u00a0\nWhen rates are raised or cut, there\u2019s a global chain reaction impacting everything from international trade to exchange rates to capital flows and foreign investment:\n2022-2024: Fed rate hikes & cuts\nThe Fed\u2019s rate policy from 2022 to 2024 marks a dramatic swing between aggressive hikes and easing measures. In 2022 and 2023, they raised rates at an unprecedented pace to cool the economy after supply chain issues and high consumer demand. By late 2023, rampant inflation showed signs of easing.\u00a0\nThen, at their meeting on September 18th, 2024, they enacted their first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic\u201450 basis points to help the weak labor market.\u00a0\nBy cutting rates in 2024, the Fed addressed concerns about slow economic growth, as well as rising unemployment. To prevent further deterioration of job gains and rising unemployment rates, the Fed aims to make borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments and spending, which can help create more jobs and stimulate the economy while keeping inflation manageable.\n2019-2020: Fed rate cuts\nGoing into 2020, the Fed cut rates to help stimulate the economy amidst global uncertainty. The end of 2019 marked concerns about trade tensions, with slow global growth and muted inflation, which prompted them to cut rates. But then the pandemic hit, causing them to shift from caution to emergency action. When the world shut down in March of 2020, in an unprecedented move to support the economy, the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero.\u00a0\nPaired with quantitative easing to mitigate any economic fallout once businesses started boarding up and unemployment soared, the Fed's actions were designed to flood the financial system with liquidity and encourage borrowing and spending. Cutting rates to almost zero, businesses could borrow for much cheaper than before, and allowed for consumers to finance large purchases.\u00a0\n2015-2018: Fed rate hikes\nIn the wake of near-zero rates after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since 2006. They were confident the US economy was starting to recover, thanks to steady job growth and more consumer spending. While these rate hikes were modest, they were scant for a reason: After years of extraordinary measures, they wanted to normalize the monetary policy. Then, by 2018, they'd raised the rates four times as the economy strengthened.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, a volatile market led to a more cautious stance by the Fed as trade tensions and slow global growth raised concerns about the sustainability of the economic expansion. Worried that the rate hikes could stifle any growth and propel the US into a deeper economic dive, they hit pause on tightening the economy.\n2007-2008: Fed rate cuts\nFinancial markets unraveled when the housing bubble burst, causing the Fed to make sharp rate cuts in 2007 and 2008. These were supposed to help cushion the U.S. economy amid the subprime mortgage crisis, but the response was a full-blown global financial meltdown.\u00a0\nThe Fed brought rates to near zero after cutting them from over 5% by the end of 2008. Amid bailouts and emergency lending to stabilize banks, they sought to prevent a deeper economic collapse. This period became known as The Great Recession.\u00a0\u00a0\n2005-2006: Fed rate hikes\nTo prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates in the mid-2000s. The economy was expanding and housing prices were surging, so the Fed made a series of rate hikes from 2005 to 2006. With potential speculation in the housing market and increasing inflation, the Fed sought to curb excessive borrowing and prevent the formation of asset bubbles by steadily raising interest rates. By December 2005, they'd raised rates for 13 straight times.\nThis made borrowing more expensive, which cooled the housing market and brought rising prices under control during this period of economic instability that ran rampant with unchecked inflation and speculative activity.\u00a0\n2001-2003: Fed rate cuts\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Reserve had a lot to contend with\u2014the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the aftermath of September 11th. From 2001 to 2003, the Fed made a series of rate cuts to help stimulate an economy rocked by back-to-back crises. They slashed rates from 6.5% to 1% during this period to support growth and encourage more borrowing and investments. In 2001 alone, they cut rates 11 times.\nWhile these extended periods of rate cuts helped the economic slowdown, they also contributed to the eventual housing market bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008.\n1999-2000: Fed rate hikes\nWith a growing technology sector and booming economic growth, the Fed raised rates in 1999 and 2000. This helped to control inflation, especially as tech stocks experienced rapid growth. They raised rates five times between 1999 and 2000 to prevent overheating the economy. However, with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the following economic downturn, they shifted to cutting rates shortly afterward.\n1998: Fed rate cuts\nWith growing concerns over the global financial system, the Fed made a series of rate cuts in 1998. A major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, collapsed around the same time as serious instability in worldwide markets, influenced by the Asian financial crisis. The Fed's aim was to prevent the US from sinking into a recession. Totaling 75 basis points, the three rate cuts helped stabilize the markets.\nThe Fed made these cuts to encourage borrowing and investments, and by the end of 1998, the economy was relatively strong despite what was happening in external markets. However, some economists suggest that this period of extended rate cuts helped contribute to the dot-com bubble bust in the following years.\n1997: Fed rate hike\nIn 1997, the Fed raised rates in response to strong economic growth and a tightening labor market. Unemployment fell to historic lows, and when inflationary pressure increased, the Fed hiked rates to prevent overheating the economy. While they wanted to keep the stock market rising and bolster the ongoing expansion, the Fed also had to keep inflation in check.\u00a0\nThey made just one rate increase in 1997 to maintain price stability and consumer confidence. Throughout the decade, they were careful to balance growth and inflationary pressures.\n1995-1996: Fed rate cuts\nThe U.S. saw an economic expansion following the 1990s recession, so the Fed cut rates in 1995 and 1996. Earlier in the decade, the Fed grew concerned that the economy was slowing, partly due to reduced inflationary pressure. They wanted to encourage borrowing and investing so the economy could expand even further. These cuts kept inflation under control and helped reignite growth.\nThis ushered the economy into continued prosperity in the late 1990s, thanks to steady growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. However, critics argue that these low rates led to riskier financial markets that led to the dot-com bubble.\n1994-1995: Fed rate hikes\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve went on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 1994. With rapid economic expansion and more inflationary pressure, the federal funds rate jumped from 3% to 6% between February 1994 and February 1995. This was to prevent the economy from overheating and curb inflation, especially as wages increased and the labor market tightened.\nWhile these hikes controlled inflation, they also slowed the economy down, especially as sectors like housing and manufacturing, which are more sensitive to interest rates, saw reduced demand due to higher borrowing costs. These made loans more expensive, so home sales dropped and industrial production slowed, leading to even more economic deceleration. By early 1995, the Fed paused these rate increases to help maintain long-term stability, which fueled the expansion in the late 1990s.\n1990-1992: Fed rate cuts\nA recession began in 1990, and to stimulate the economy, the Fed made a series of rate cuts. The savings and loan crisis, Gulf War oil prices, and slowing consumer spending combined to trigger this recession. The Fed brought the federal funds rate from 8% to 3% over a two-year period to help encourage borrowing and investing in a sluggish economy.\nThis laid the groundwork for the economic recovery experienced by the mid-90s, as it was cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow, so they were encouraged to spend more. Industries reliant on consumer credit, such as the real estate market, benefited from these lower rates. This gradual economic recovery took some time to come to fruition, though many agree the Fed's actions helped prevent a deeper, more prolonged recession.\nThe takeaway\nThe federal fund rate's history shows the tough balancing act that the Fed employs to sustain economic growth while controlling inflation. During periods of rapid growth, rate hikes help curb inflation, while during economic slowdowns, rate cuts help stimulate borrowing.\u00a0\nAs a consumer and investor, knowing when and why the Federal Reserve makes adjustments to the federal funds rates can help you decide when to borrow, invest, and save. For example, if rates are high, you might want to wait to refinance your mortgage, but it might be an excellent time to stash some cash in a high-yield savings account or CD.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\nThe Federal Reserve oversees the United States' monetary policy as the central banking system. It regulates financial institutions, works to maintain economic stability, and manages the nation's money supply.\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\nThe Federal Reserve controls interest rates, works to keep inflation in check, and tries to stabilize the financial system. It also supervises banks, provides financial services to the US government, and is a lender during financial crises.\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\nThe Federal Reserve was formed in 1913 to provide a more stable banking system and to help stem financial panics like the one that caused the Panic of 1907. This saw widespread bank runs and deteriorated confidence in the economic system. This central authority to manage monetary policy and give emergency support to banks helped create a more resilient financial environment.\nRead more\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach.

      "2024 Golden State Warriors Playoffs Picture after loss vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Updated standings, schedule and\u00a0more\u00a0(March\u00a024)\nThe Golden State Warriors (36-33) faced a significant challenge as they clashed with the Minnesota Timberwolves (48-22) on Sunday night. With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime. Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga also made significant contributions with 11 points each in the first half.\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\nIn the third quarter, the Timberwolves mounted a comeback, narrowing the gap to three points with a score of 81-78. Mike Conley led Minnesota's resurgence with six points, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker also chipped in six points in the Timberwolves rally.\nDespite Minnesota's efforts, Steph Curry led the charge to maintain Golden State's lead, adding eight points in the quarter. Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory. Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role in Minnesota's win, contributing 23 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid delivered double-double performances to aid Edwards in securing the victory.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Updated Standings\nAfter suffering from a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Golden State Warriors now have a 36-34 record. While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference. Winning those two games would keep their Play-In Tournament hopes alive.\nTimberwolves Nation!

      "2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 Boston Red Sox | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 Boston Red Sox, a blend of youth and experience, is a team to watch. The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right.
