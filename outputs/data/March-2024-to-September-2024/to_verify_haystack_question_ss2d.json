It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties, including but not limited to the issuer.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.

the WhoScored rating algorithm. The algorithm is their own, but the stats the rating is based on are sourced straight from Opta.\nOpta review their stats after each game, so the rating is also subject to change for a day or so after the match.\nFor matches that WhoScored does not cover, the ratings and stats from either SofaScore or FotMob are used instead.\nAgain, both SofaScore and FotMob are powered by Opta stats. The only difference with SofaScore is that their key pass stats also include Opta's \"Second Assist\" in addition to passes that lead to shots. The definition for this is \"a pass that creates an opportunity for another player to assist a goal\", however this is a relatively rare occurrence.\n\u00a9 2024 Messi vs Ronaldo | Illustrations by Denis Davydov | Contact | Privacy Policy\nTop Scorers Club\n",

It's nearly impossible to imagine any other male player ever reaching this incredible feat.\u00a0\nFrom his early days at Sporting CP to his stints with Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and currently Al Nassr, Ronaldo's career has been nothing short of legendary. His accolades include five Ballon d'Or awards, numerous titles across three of Europe's top five leagues, and five UEFA Champions League trophies.\nPart of Portugal's winning Euro 2016 side, Ronaldo also boasts the record for most international goals scored by a male player and is the only man to have played more than 200 games for his senior national team.\nOn September 5, 2024, Ronaldo struck his historic 900th goal, meeting a pinpoint cross from the left from Nuno Mendes before turning the ball home from close range, doubling Portugal's lead against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League.

Since then we have been steadily expanding our coverage to include domestic leagues from over 40 countries as well as domestic cup, super cup and youth leagues from top European countries. We have also added coverage for major international cups such as the UEFA Champions League and Copa Libertadores.\nFBref is the most complete sources for women's football data on the internet. This includes the entire history of the FIFA Women's World Cup as well as recent domestic league seasons from nine countries, including advanced stats like xG for most of those nine.\nIn collaboration with Opta, we are including advanced analytical data such as xG, xA, progressive passing, duels and more for over twenty competitions. For more information on the expected goals model and which competitions have advanced data, see our xG explainer.\nNote that player records are likely not complete for their careers. Players may come from or move to leagues we don't currently cover. This issue will go down over time, as we add new leagues and seasons. We will never in the future have less data than we do today.\nYou can sign up to receive an e-mail when new countries and features launch.\nFor more information, see our Launch Blog Post, the overall leagues/competition page with details on leagues and seasons we include, or our About Page.\nLet us know if you find an issue or have a suggestion.\nFBref is one of seven Sports-Reference.com sites.\nMore Cristiano Ronaldo Pages\nCristiano Ronaldo Overview\nPlayer Comparison\nStats by Competition\nMatch Logs (Summary)\nMatch Logs (Passing)\nMatch Logs (Pass Types)\nMatch Logs (Goal and Shot Creation)\nMatch Logs (Defensive Actions)\nMatch Logs (Possession)\nMatch Logs (Miscellaneous Stats)\nGoal Logs by Competition\nScouting Report\nFull Site Menu\nWe're Social...for Statheads\nEvery Sports Reference Social Media Account\nSite Last Updated: Sunday, November 26, 10:47PM\nQuestion, Comment, Feedback, or Correction?\nSubscribe to our Free Email Newsletter\nDo you have a sports website?
