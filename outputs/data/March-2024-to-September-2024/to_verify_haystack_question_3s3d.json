Shares of Nvidia were up 189% year to date as of Friday, easily outpacing any of the company\u2019s chip rivals. AMD (AMD), Nvidia\u2019s closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink nearly 8% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge 51%.\nNvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines versus the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion.\nNvidia\u2019s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That\u2019s a 100% increase versus the $14.5 billion the company reported in Q3 last year.\nGaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year when the segment brought in $2.8 billion.\nAnalysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%.\nInvestors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for the quarter, but if it raises its outlook for Q4 as well. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to announce Q4 guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the coming quarter.\nEven if it delivers a stellar report and outlook, shares could still fall following the earnings announcement. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results.\nThat could have been a sign that some investors weren\u2019t impressed with Nvidia\u2019s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains at the time.\nInvestors will also be on the lookout for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company\u2019s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production will pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips.\n (NVDA)\nAt the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he expects that to continue in the year ahead. What\u2019s more, he said the company\u2019s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, is expected to continue selling well into the coming quarter.\nNvidia, however, is also facing an uncertain future, with president-elect Trump threatening to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. He\u2019s also raised the specter of tariffs for chips made in Taiwan as a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US.\nThe vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers. Investors are sure to be looking for any guidance Huang has to offer on the topic.\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 20% year-over-year.\nCosts and expenses \u2013 Total costs and expenses were $23.24 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year.\nCapital expenditures \u2013 Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $9.20 billion.\nCapital return program \u2013 Share repurchases were $8.86 billion of our Class A common stock and total dividend and dividend equivalent payments were $1.26 billion.\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities \u2013 Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $70.90 billion as of September 30, 2024. Free cash flow was $15.52 billion.\nLong-term debt \u2013 Long-term debt was $28.82 billion as of September 30, 2024.\nHeadcount \u2013 Headcount was 72,404 as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 9% year-over-year.\n\nCFO Outlook Commentary\nWe expect fourth quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $45-48 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is approximately neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-98 billion, updated from our prior range of $96-99 billion. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect 2024 operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and investments to further scale our ecosystem.\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. We continue to expect significant capital expenditures growth in 2025. Given this, along with the back-end weighted nature of our 2024 capital expenditures, we expect a significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year as we recognize higher growth in depreciation and operating expenses of our expanded infrastructure fleet.\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our fourth quarter 2024 tax rate to be in the low-teens.\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today. The live webcast of Meta's earnings conference call can be accessed at the Meta Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com, along with the earnings press release, financial tables, and slide presentation.\nFollowing the call, a replay will be available at the same website. Transcripts of conference calls with publishing equity research analysts held today will also be posted to the investor.fb.com website.\nDisclosure Information\nMeta uses the investor.fb.com and about.fb.com/news/ websites as well as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Page (facebook.com/zuck), Instagram account (instagram.com/zuck) and Threads profile (threads.net/zuck) as means of disclosing material non-public information and for complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nAbout Meta\nMeta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content and advertising review and enforcement efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August\u00a01, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September\u00a030, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is October\u00a030, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items:\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three and nine months ended September\u00a030, 2024 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME(In millions, except per

These new scenarios were developed by the U.S. Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flood Hazard Scenarios and Tools Interagency Task Force as input into the U.S. Global Change Research\r\n                            Program Sustained Assessment process and, Fifth National Climate Assessment. These RSL scenarios\r\n                            provide an update to the NOAA 2017 scenarios, which were developed as input to the Fourth National\r\n                            Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            While these RSL scenarios begin in 2005, they have been adjusted to 2000 to more easily compare them with the 2017 RSL scenarios. They take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local vertical land motion.  \r\n                        \n\r\n                            By 2050 (relative to sea level in 2000), RSL projections range from 0.40\u20100.45 meters along the East Coast,\r\n                            0.55\u20100.65 meters along the Gulf Coast, 0.20\u20100.30 meters along the West Coast, 0.20\u20100.35 meters along\r\n                            the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands, 0.30 meters along the northern coast of Alaska, and an RSL\r\n                            decrease along the southern coast of Alaska\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100.

Based on the most recent scientific understanding, and as discussed in the IPCC AR6, the\r\n                            uncertain physical processes that could lead to much higher increases in sea level are now viewed as\r\n                            less plausible in the coming decades before potentially becoming a factor toward the end of the 21st\r\n                            century. A GMSL increase of 2.5 meters is thus viewed as less plausible and the associated scenario has\r\n                            been removed.\r\n                        \n2017 Sea Level Rise Technical Report:\n\r\n                            The five relative sea level rise (RSL) scenarios shown in this tab are derived from NOAA Technical Report\r\n                            NOS CO-OPS 083: \u201cGlobal and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States\u201d using the same\r\n                            methods as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change Curve Calculator.

These RSL scenarios provide a revision to the global scenarios that were developed\r\n                            (Parris et. al, 2012) as input to the Third National Climate Assessment.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            These RSL scenarios begin in 2000 and take into account global mean sea level rise (GMSL), regional\r\n                            changes in ocean circulation, changes in Earth\u2019s gravity field due to ice melt redistribution, and local\r\n                            vertical land motion.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            For almost all the scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be greater than the global average in the U.S. Northeast\r\n                            and the western Gulf of Mexico. In intermediate and low scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be less than the\r\n                            global average in much of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. For high scenarios, RSL rise is likely to be\r\n                            higher than the global average along all U.S. coastlines outside Alaska.\r\n                        \n\nNote: We do not show the low scenario, as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nAdditional Information:\n\r\n                            A RSL-change adjustment to the current National Tidal Datum Epoch (1983-2001) will cause a minimal\r\n                            offset that may be needed for some applications. The USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator can\r\n                            correct for this offset.\r\n                        \n\r\n                            Rounding to the nearest 1-foot mapping increment to view potential impacts is appropriate based on\r\n                            the accuracy of the elevation and tidal surface data used as mapping inputs.\r\n                        \nMapping Confidence\nThe inundation areas depicted in the Sea Level Rise tab are not as precise as they may appear. There are many unknowns when mapping future conditions, including natural evolution of the coastal landforms (e.g., barrier island overwash and migration), as well as the data used to predict the changes. The presentation of confidence in these maps only represents the known error in the elevation data and tidal corrections.\nBlue areas denote a high confidence of inundation, orange areas denote a high degree of uncertainty, and unshaded areas denote a high confidence that these areas will be dry given the chosen water level.\nIn this application 80% is considered a high degree of confidence such that, for example, the blue areas denote locations that may be correctly mapped as 'inundated' more than 8 out of 10 times. Areas with a high degree of uncertainty represent locations that may be mapped correctly (either as inundated or dry) less than 8 out of 10 times.\r\n                        For a detailed description of the confidence levels and their computation, see the methods document.\nMarsh\nZoom to your area of interest and click on the closest Scenario Location icon in the map.

You can learn more about them within the Local\r\n                            Scenarios Tab of this viewer.\r\n                        \nNote: We do not show the low scenario as it is a continuation of the current global trend since the early\r\n                            1990s and has been determined to have a low probability of occurring by 2100. Furthermore, this\r\n                            scenario would be associated with low levels of risk even if it did occur.\r\n                        \nSocial Vulnerability\nBy overlaying social and economic data on a map that depicts sea level rise, a community can see the potential impact that sea level rise can have on vulnerable people and businesses.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index, which shows areas of high human vulnerability to hazards, is based on population attributes from Census 2010 (e.g., age and poverty) and the built environment. By looking at the intersection of potential sea level rise and vulnerable Census tracts, one can get an idea of how vulnerable populations might be affected by sea level rise. Dark red indicates tracts having a high vulnerability, and the lighter reds indicate decreasing vulnerability.\nHigh Tide Flooding\nAnnual occurrences of tidal flooding\u2014exceeding local thresholds for minor impacts\r\n            \t\t\tto infrastructure\u2014have increased 5- to 10-fold since the 1960s in several U.S. coastal\r\n            \t\t\tcities. The changes in high tide flooding over time are greatest where elevation is lower, local RSL rise is higher, or extreme variability is less.\nIn a sense, today\u2019s flood will become tomorrow\u2019s high tide, as sea level rise will cause flooding to occur more frequently and last for longer durations of time.\nThe red layer in the map represents areas currently subject to tidal flooding, often called \u201crecurrent or nuisance flooding.\u201d\nClick on a NOAA tide station icon in the map to see historical inundation events in flood days per year. The flood thresholds used in these plots are derived national flood thresholds from NOAA Technical Report NOS CO-OPS 086: Patterns and Projections of High Tide Flooding Along the U.S. Coastline Using a Common Impact Threshold. The derived thresholds used here provide a national definition of coastal flooding and impacts for quantifying and communicating risk. These thresholds may deviate from NWS impact thresholds which take into account local flood risk and are used to issue NWS coastal flood watches, warnings,  and advisories.\nCurrent Location\nHigh Tide Flooding\nHistorical Yearly Inundation Events\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\nUse the sea level rise snapshot to communicate potential impacts at the county level\nLake Level Viewer\nVisualize potential lake level changes and impacts for the U.S. Great Lakes\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\nMap people, places, and natural resources that are potentially exposed to coastal flooding\nTakeaways from the 2022 Sea Level Rise Technical Report\nWatch this video to explore four takeaways from the report and key actions that communities can take\nGet more sea level rise and inundation resources and tools from the Digital Coast.\nAbout Sea Level Rise Viewer v 3.0.0\nThe purpose of this map viewer is to provide federal, state, and local coastal resource managers and planners with a preliminary look at sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts. The viewer is a screening-level tool that uses best-available, nationally consistent data sets and analyses. Data and maps provided can be used at several scales to help estimate impacts and prioritize actions for different scenarios.\nThe data and maps in this tool illustrate the scale of potential flooding, not the exact location, and do not account for erosion, subsidence, or future construction. Water levels are shown as they would appear during the highest high tides (excludes wind-driven tides). The data, maps, and information provided should be used only as a screening-level tool for management decisions. As with all remotely sensed data, all features should be verified with a site visit. The data and maps in this tool are provided \u201cas is\u201d without warranty to their performance, merchantable state, or fitness for any particular purpose. The entire risk associated with the results and performance of these data is assumed by the user. This tool should be used strictly as a planning reference tool and not for navigation, permitting, or other legal purposes.\nAdditional Resources\nLeveed Areas Disclaimer\nLevees are displayed as yellow lines, and enclosed leveed areas are displayed as a white stippled pattern.\nMajor federal leveed areas were assumed high enough and strong enough to protect against inundation depicted in this viewer, and therefore no inundation was mapped in these regions.\nMinor (nonfederal) leveed areas were mapped using the best available elevation data that capture leveed features. In some cases, however, breaks in elevation occur along leveed areas because of flood control features being removed from elevation data, limitations of the horizontal and vertical resolution of the elevation data, the occurrence of levee drainage features, and so forth. Flooding behind levees is only depicted if breaks in elevation data occur or if the levee elevations are overtopped by the water surface. At some flood levels, alternate pathways around\u2014not through\u2014levees, walls, dams, and flood gates may exist that allow water to flow into areas protected at lower levels. In general, imperfect levee and elevation data make assessing protection difficult, and small data errors can have large consequences.\nAs new elevation data become available, or as stakeholders provide additional levee information, the NOAA Office for Coastal Management will periodically update the inundation and levee data.\n",

A presidential disaster was declared on September 13, 2021 (FEMA-4615-DR). As part of the response to the disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Building Science Disaster Support program deployed a Mitigation Assessment Team (MAT) to assess the damage. MATs are composed of federal and non-federal experts in building science and other relevant disciplines. 1.1. Report Objective The primary objectives of the FEMA Building Science Disaster Support program are to improve the resistance of buildings to natural hazards and improve the safety of building occupants. Its work includes evaluating the key causes of building damage and failure, and recommending solutions. The remnants of Hurricane Ida produced widespread urban flooding that overwhelmed the stormwater drainage system in many parts of New York City. As a result, many streets, low-lying areas, underpasses, and some parts of the subway system flooded. During Hurricane Ida, floodwater entered and damaged many buildings with below-grade and basement areas. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 1, Building Performance: Basement Buildings and Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), notes this type of flood damage has occurred many times in the past. That report also describes the impacts of basement flooding on life safety, buildings, and building utility systems and equipment. It includes a number of recommendations to address the safety of basement occupants and the performance of buildings with floodprone basements. The Hurricane Ida NYC MAT Technical Report 2, Building Performance: Egress from Floodprone Basements (FEMA P-2333), includes brief summaries of New York City\u2019s requirements and agency programs and responsibilities related to egress. This report briefly explains the basics of rainfall runoff, urban flooding, and urban stormwater drainage systems. It gives a summary of some of New York City\u2019s stormwater infrastructure programs and its initiatives to address urban flooding. Applying mitigation measures to stormwater drainage systems and existing buildings can minimize the potential loss of life and injuries, and reduce property damage from future urban flooding events. After deployment to New York City, the Team produced three technical reports and four fact sheets that relate to the effects of Hurricane Ida on the city. The documents focus on some construction and stormwater issues that were not considered in previous MAT investigations, including: Urban Flooding: The inundation of property in a built environment, particularly in more densely populated areas. Urban flooding may be caused by rainfall that runs off large amounts of impervious surfaces and overwhelms the capacity of stormwater drainage systems.

Hurricane Ida in New York City On August 29, 2021, Hurricane Ida made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Lafourche Parish, on the Louisiana coastline. This was only 50 miles west of where Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the same day in 2005. The storm generated high winds and storm surge, causing widespread damage to structures and to power and telecommunication infrastructure throughout the state. As Hurricane Ida moved inland, beyond Louisiana (Figure 1), it produced heavy rain and unsettled weather in several states. The National Weather Service reported extreme rainfall (Figure 2) caused flash flooding in New York and neighboring states. Figure 1. Storm track of Hurricane Ida from August 26 through September 4, 2021 Source: National Hurricane Center 3 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding During Hurricane Ida, heavy rainfall overwhelmed the stormwater drainage systems in many parts of New York City. Surface water accumulated, causing significant urban flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. The peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour, with a total of 7.13 inches of rain over a 24-hour period. It is important to note that Hurricane Ida was preceded by the remnants of Tropical Storm Fred and Hurricane Henri, which saturated the city with heavy rainfall in August. Figure 2. Total precipitation recorded over 24 hours, September 1-2, 2021, in New York and neighboring states In some areas of the city, the rainfall runoff exceeded the capacity of the stormwater drainage system. Runoff accumulated in streets and low-lying areas (Figure 3). It entered the basements, cellars, and below-grade areas of numerous homes, multi-family buildings, and commercial buildings. Surface water entered through exterior stairways, street-level windows, once it rose above the stair thresholds or windowsills. In multi-story buildings, water typically entered through loading docks, exterior stairwells, access ramps, or through street-level vents and windows.

When rain falls on the ground, the water can soak in. But when rain falls on buildings and paved surfaces, it runs off without soaking in. When rainfall runoff does not drain away from low-lying areas, or does not drain away quickly, the accumulated water is called urban flooding. Urban flooding also occurs when curbs, gutters and other parts of stormwater drainage systems cannot contain the flow of water from extreme or heavy precipitation. These drainage problems are also called stormwater flooding, local flooding, or nuisance flooding. Precipitation is considered extreme or heavy when the amount of rain or snow from an event substantially exceeds what is considered to be normal. These events can be measured by their frequency, their return periods (the chance that the event will be equaled or exceeded in a given year), or the amount of the precipitation in a certain period. It is common to describe storms in terms of the inches of rain falling in one hour or over a 24-hour period. Urban flooding from extreme or heavy rainfall or rapidly melting deep snow can overwhelm drainage systems and damage property. In vulnerable areas, buildings may be damaged when this runoff enters basements or below-grade areas (such as parking garages). The property damage may be structural, non-structural, or both. It can include damage to building service equipment and contents. Also, the flooding of basements and below-grade areas puts people\u2019s lives at risk if they get trapped without a way to escape. Figure 3. New York City street flooding during Hurricane Ida Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 5 Extreme Rainfall Runoff in New York City The New York City Mayor\u2019s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice reports that extreme rainfall events, such as Hurricane Ida, are becoming more frequent. The city considers a rainfall event to be extreme if more than 1.74 inches of rain fall in Central Park. During Hurricane Ida in 2021, the peak rainfall intensity in Central Park was 3.15 inches per hour. This is nearly double the intensity-duration value the city has used to design its stormwater infrastructure since about 1970. Hurricane Ida produced significant surface flooding in Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Staten Island. In all those areas, the capacity of the stormwater drainage systems was exceeded. 3.\nUrban Stormwater Drainage System Basics Communities build stormwater drainage systems to collect and convey surface runoff to minimize impacts on buildings, infrastructure, streets, and other property. The components of a drainage system include curbs and gutters, drainage swales and ditches, inlets where water flows into catch basins, and below-ground stormwater pipes. The whole system is intended to carry rainfall runoff and snow melt to a stream, river, or tidal body of water. In general, there are two types of stormwater systems: \uf0a7 Combined sewer systems. These systems use a single set of pipes to carry flows from sanitary sewer systems and stormwater runoff to waste treatment plants for processing (Figure 4). During normal rainfall events, well-maintained combined sewer systems function effectively. During extreme rainfall events, combined systems can \u201csurcharge,\u201d which refers to flows that exceed the capacity of the system. Surcharged systems may create backup flows that enter the plumbing systems of buildings. Combined systems are built with bypass locations that allow excess flows to discharge into receiving streams, rivers, or tidal waters without treatment.\nThese points are identified as combined sewer outfalls. They are governed by regulations on water quality treatment. Figure 4. Schematic of Combined Sewer System Source: NYC DPW Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 6 \uf0a7 Separate stormwater sewer system. These systems use two sets of pipes that separate sanitary sewer flows from stormwater flows. Because the systems are separate, heavy stormwater runoff does not overwhelm wastewater treatment plants. This minimizes overflow sewage discharges to receiving waters. For years, many cities designed their stormwater drainage systems to handle the runoff from what is called the \u201c5-year storm\u201d or the \u201c10-year storm.\u201d The intensity of the rainfall associated with those storm frequencies varies by location. Cities and urbanized areas recognize that, as rainfall runoff increases, the stormwater drainage infrastructure will be challenged in several ways: \uf0a7 As storms get more intense and occur more frequently due to climate change, the rainfall runoff will exceed the capacity of the drainage system more frequently.\n\uf0a7 As systems get older, they may not perform as intended. This is especially true in areas where buildings and impervious surfaces have been added, which increases the amount of runoff and may contribute to property damage and safety hazards.\n\uf0a7 Drainage systems must be inspected and maintained to keep them working properly.\nMaintenance typically includes removing debris and leaves, cleaning out catch basins and stormwater pipes, and making repairs.\n\uf0a7 The use of rain gardens, stormwater ponds, special paving materials, and other features is increasing. These measures help runoff soak into the ground instead of flowing to stormwater systems. Methods and features that reduce rainfall runoff by increasing infiltration are often called \u201cgreen infrastructure.\u201d Stormwater Drainage Systems in New York City \uf0a7 About 60% of New York City is served by combined sewer systems. The other 40% has separate stormwater and sewer systems.\n\uf0a7 In most areas of the city where storm drains were built before 1970, the drainage system components were designed to handle the runoff from a 3-year storm event.\n\uf0a7 In areas where stormwater drainage systems were built after 1970, the components are designed for a higher-impact event, using the intensity-duration values for a storm with a 5-year return period (equivalent to 1.75 inches per hour for a 1-hour storm).\n4.\nNew York City Stormwater Infrastructure and Initiatives New York City has an extensive program to monitor and maintain its stormwater drainage and sewer systems. To function properly, stormwater infrastructure must be inspected, maintained, and repaired. Especially in areas where extreme storms produce urban flooding that damages buildings, Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 7 debris and leaves must be removed from inlets and catch basins. The city inspects and maintains its system using a data-driven approach. The city routinely identifies where improving the stormwater infrastructure in certain areas can increase its capacity. Increased capacity is needed, as more extreme storms are expected in the future. The city examines inefficient inlets and underground pipes to see if improvements are feasible. However, the city recognizes that, in many areas, the stormwater sewers cannot be enlarged. Physically increasing the capacity of a stormwater drainage system is expensive. Even where feasible upgrades are identified, implementation may take decades. Given the acknowledged importance of addressing many problem areas subject to urban flooding, the city established a long-term vision to increase its stormwater resilience. The vision merges traditional stormwater approaches with plans for a citywide network of blue and green infrastructure. This network would intercept more rainfall runoff before it reaches the stormwater drainage system. 4.1. Pursue the Long-Term Vision In 2022, New York City updated its approach to managing stormwater. It released \u201cIncreasing Stormwater Resilience in the Face of Climate Change: Our Long Term Vision.\u201d In 2021, back-to-back storms with heavy rainfall\u2014Hurricanes Henri and Ida\u2014spurred the city to take action. It reaffirmed that its stormwater infrastructure was never intended to manage frequent events with such intense rainfall runoff. Highlights of this plan are available at: https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/climate-resiliency/increasing-stormwater-resilience-in-the-face-of-climate-change.pdf. The highlights include: \uf0a7 Upgrade and rehabilitate the sewer system, using historical records, topography, and the likelihood of future flooding to prioritize areas for work (see Section 4.2) \uf0a7 Keep the stormwater on private property (see Section 4.3) \uf0a7 Promote infiltration and green infrastructure (see Section 4.4) \uf0a7 Expand Bluebelts and daylight historic streams and wetlands (see Section 4.5) \uf0a7 Implement \u201ccloudburst\u201d management Infrastructure (see Section 4.6) \uf0a7 Adapt to climate change, provide online Stormwater Flood Maps, and administer Rainfall Ready NYC, an action plan with short-term steps that the city and its residents can take to prepare for urban flooding (see Section 5.1) \uf0a7 As a part of FloodNet, install sensors, monitor flood conditions, and increase awareness (see Section 5.2) 4.2. Upgrade and Rehabilitate the Sewer System New York City's stormwater drainage system includes more than 7,000 miles of sewers and many other components. As a whole, it is not intended to handle the rainfall runoff from extreme storms. In Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 8 addition, some parts of the city do not have fully built systems. The city uses a variety of factors to prioritize areas to upgrade the system in order to relieve urban flooding. These factors include the projected sea level rise and environmental justice for residents. The city has a long-term objective to upgrade and rehabilitate all systems to the current design standard. That standard calls for the system to handle the runoff from 1.75 inches of rain in one hour. As of mid-2023, the city is evaluating the adequacy of that standard, given the growing frequency and intensity of extreme storms. On the first anniversary of Hurricane Ida, Mayor Eric Adams announced a suite of stormwater initiatives. He highlighted completed and ongoing projects in several parts of the city, including upgrading and increasing the size of sewers, building new stormwater drainage systems, raising some streets, and separating combined sewer systems to increase capacity and improve water quality, Read more at https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/637-22/mayor-adams-dep-honor-first-anniversary-hurricane-ida-suite-stormwater#/0. 4.3. Retain Stormwater on Private Property A significant initiative in New York City\u2019s long-term vision is to increase retention of rainfall runoff on private properties. In 2022, the city adopted amendments to its Unified Stormwater Rule. The amendments change requirements for how to manage stormwater on newly built or rebuilt properties. Hydrologic and hydraulic models estimate that by 2030, this rule change will reduce combined sewer overflows citywide by approximately 360 million fewer gallons. This will also help improve the health of New York Harbor. The changes to the Unified Stormwater Rule modified the rate of flow for house and site connections to the city\u2019s combined sewer system. The city must determine sewer availability and approve any new connections to the system. Sewer certifications may be required when a site is altered or renovated in a way that increases sanitary flows or stormwater flows. To meet the new requirements, developers will use a variety of measures to retain or detain stormwater onsite and to increase rainfall infiltration into the ground. Some of those measures are described in Section 4.4. Find more information at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/stormwater-management.page. 4.4. Promote Infiltration and Green Infrastructure Increasing infiltration of rainfall runoff through various methods is an effective way to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through stormwater management systems. The term \u201cgreen infrastructure\u201d refers to a variety of ways to increase infiltration. New York City has built or encouraged thousands of green infrastructure installations. Green infrastructure offers significant benefit in areas of the city served by combined sewer systems because the measures help reduce the number and frequency of untreated sewer overflows to receiving waters. Combined sewers are described in Section 3. Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 9 The types of green infrastructure installed in New York City include rain gardens, infiltration basins, stormwater greenstreets, green roofs, blue roofs, permeable paving, subsurface detention systems, and rain barrels and cisterns. Figure 5 illustrates two of these methods. The city offers some financial incentives to developers and owners to install green infrastructure on private property. Learn more about these measures at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/types-of-green-infrastructure.page. The site also has an interactive map to show where green infrastructure measures have been installed. 4.5. Expand the Bluebelt Program \u201cBluebelts\u201d are developed as components of New York City\u2019s drainage system. They are ecologically rich and cost-effective ways to handle rainfall runoff from streets and sidewalks. Areas with Bluebelts do not have to rely entirely on traditional stormwater drainage system components, such as underground pipes. The program preserves natural drainage corridors including streams, ponds, and wetlands. It enhances those Porous Pavement Green Roof Figure 5. New York City site with porous pavement and green roof Figure 6. Sweet Brook Bluebelt Source: NYC Water Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 10 features to allow them to perform their functions of conveying, storing, and filtering runoff. Bluebelts also provide open green space and diverse habitat for wildlife (see Figure 6). Bluebelts are part of the city\u2019s initiatives to prepare for heavier rains due to climate change. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/water/the-bluebelt-program.page. Prior to the first Bluebelt initiative in Staten Island, very few streets in the Sweet Brook area had catch basins or storm drains. Streets often flooded during heavy rainstorms. The Bluebelt project modified drainage in several ways, including adding catch basins to direct rainfall runoff to wetlands. As of mid-2023, the city has more than 75 separate Bluebelts at locations throughout the city. 4.6. Implement Cloudburst Management A \u201ccloudburst\u201d is a sudden, heavy downpour, where a lot of rain falls in a short time. It is another term for extreme or heavy precipitation that substantially exceeds what is considered normal. In New York City, cloudburst management combines methods, including green infrastructure, to absorb, store, and transfer stormwater (see Figure 7). In this way, it reduces the strain on the city\u2019s stormwater drainage system. The goal is to minimize flooding and damage to property and infrastructure. The city considers many factors when planning cloudburst management projects. Factors include a site\u2019s existing physical features, available space, below-ground conditions, existing utility infrastructure, and whether it is possible to connect runoff to green infrastructure. The city also looks at local social and economic factors in each area that may incorporate special amenities and public open spaces. Learn more at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/environment/cloudburst.page. 5.\nIncreasing Public Awareness of Urban Flooding The effects of urban flooding vary, ranging from water ponding in low areas to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and drivers and damage to buildings. FEMA NYC MAT Fact Sheet 1, What Building Owners and Tenants Should Know About Urban Flooding (FEMA P-2333), briefly explains how flooding differs from the flood hazard areas shown on FEMA flood maps. It also describes safety risks and how flooding affects buildings and occupants. Figure 7. Two ways to provide median storage Source: NYC DEP 11 Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding New York City is working to increase public awareness of urban flooding and the risks and effects of urban flooding. This section highlights initiatives that support that goal. 5.1. AdaptNYC, Stormwater Flood Maps, and Rainfall Ready NYC AdaptNYC is New York City\u2019s plan to adapt to climate change. Adapting requires citywide, multi-generational efforts. It also requires significant investment. The initiative will improve how the city communicates about flooding risks. One focus is on neighborhoods in low-lying areas with poor drainage and insufficient stormwater drainage systems. The goal is to help people understand the potential risks of flooding. The city hopes to raise awareness of urban flooding caused by extreme rainfall events. Learn more at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/initiatives/adaptnyc/. The city developed an online tool to generate Stormwater Flood Maps. The maps depict a range of scenarios to show how stormwater and coastal flooding patterns may change over time. The tool allows users to see the flood risks for scenarios with and without sea level rise. Rising sea levels will keep some storm drain outfalls from fully draining. This will cause those storm drains to back up, which will increase street flooding. It also creates the potential for sewer backups into buildings. The map in Figure 8 shows an extreme stormwater flood scenario (about 3.5 inches of rainfall in one hour), with the 2080 projected sea level rise. Access the maps at https://climate.cityofnewyork.us/challenges/extreme-rainfall/. Rainfall Ready NYC Action Plan engages the public through a website. The website explains actions the city takes to plan and prepare for urban flooding. For example, it informs residents and owners about flood risks and offers resources to help them protect their properties. The city monitors Figure 8. NYC Stormwater Flood Map for Extreme Stormwater Flooding with 2080 Sea Level Rise Building Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 12 conditions in real time and communicates with the public about hazards. The website advises people on ways to plan and prepare for intense storms, monitor conditions during storms, and recover rapidly after damaging events. People can sign up to receive alerts from the city\u2019s official source of information about emergencies, including weather events. Learn more and sign up at https://www.nyc.gov/site/dep/whats-new/rainfall-ready-nyc.page. 5.2. FloodNet New York City uses a variety of tools to monitor flood conditions, including traffic cameras, social media, 311 complaints, and other sources. One resource is FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and the city government. This group works to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in the city. As part of FloodNet, the city is installing sensors to detect flooding from any source in real time. The sensors will be installed throughout the city in public places that are prone to flooding (see Figure 9). The sensor system is designed to inform city officials, who can then issue public warnings of the potential for damaging surface flooding. The network is slated to have 500 sensors by 2027, to give both officials and residents real-time flood information. It will also maintain a hyperlocal historical record of flooding that can be used to inform future mitigation work. Learn more at https://www.floodnet.nyc/. Figure 9.

The city acknowledges that the urban flooding problem is too big to resolve through construction alone. Instead, the city is using green infrastructure and other measures to supplement the stormwater drainage system. These measures are vital to increase the infiltration of rainfall to reduce the amount of runoff that flows to and through the stormwater management systems. The city has made major investments in stormwater infrastructure and green infrastructure. It also has several programs to require or encourage owners to retain stormwater on their properties and increase infiltration. Despite this, many buildings will remain vulnerable to damage by urban flooding. Buildings with below-grade areas and basements have the greatest risk because they may fill up once water finds a way in. Hurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 4, describes options for the city to encourage property owners to act. Some options to consider include: \uf0a7 Develop messaging and mechanisms to contact the owners and managers of buildings in areas where urban flooding has caused damage, with a focus on buildings with basements and below-grade areas. The messages should encourage them to first evaluate their buildings, and then determine whether to engage a qualified professional for a more detailed inspection.\n\uf0a7 Develop training and inspection materials for building managers and design professionals to build on evaluations that may be undertaken by owners and managers. The materials can explain how to determine whether and how surface flooding enters buildings, and how to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Encourage design professionals and the special inspectors who conduct annual and triannual inspections of dry floodproofed buildings in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the New York City building code to learn how to evaluate buildings at risk of urban flooding to identify feasible mitigation options.\n\uf0a7 Consider whether to provide financial assistance to building owners to have evaluations performed and to implement feasible mitigation options.\nHurricane Ida MAT Technical Report 1, Recommendation 5, briefly describes the benefits of evaluating flood risk to buildings with basements and below-grade areas. It describes a number of mitigation options to keep water out of those areas. The feasibility of each option depends on site factors and building characteristics. Options include: \uf0a7 Permanently raise the lowest points of entry for surface water. Points of entry may be doorways, street-level windows and vents, loading bays, exterior basement stairways, ramps to below-grade parking, and driveways.\nBuilding Performance: Reducing the Effects of Urban Flooding 14 \uf0a7 Reinforce basements walls, or fill in basements, of homes with unreinforced concrete or masonry basement walls.\n\uf0a7 Obtain temporary barriers and develop emergency implementation plans to deploy the barriers to block points of entry when permanent solutions are not feasible.\n\uf0a7 Raise critical components of mechanical systems above basement floors and relocate electrical system components to higher locations, and install backflow preventer valves in sumps and floor drains.\n\uf0a7 Use materials that resist flood damage for basement interiors.\n7.

We apologize for any inconvenience.\nAssessing the U.S. Climate in March 2024\n\n\n    Severe storms brought large hail and tornadoes to portions of the Midwest; blizzard buried parts of California under feet of snow\n    \nKey Points:\nOther Highlights:\u00a0\nTemperature\n\n\nThe average temperature of the contiguous U.S. in March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record. March temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\n\n\nFor January\u2013March, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period. Temperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest for the January\u2013March period.\nThe Alaska January\u2013March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above normal for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nPrecipitation\n\n\nMarch precipitation for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida. Maine and Rhode Island each had their second-wettest March on record.\nAlaska\u2019s average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\n\n\nThe January\u2013March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Conversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period.\nThe January\u2013March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nBillion-Dollar Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed in March 2024 after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\u00a0The U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (including CPI adjustment to 2024). The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.Winter did not bring heavy snowfall to Wisconsin nor the temperatures necessary to maintain the snow, allowing fires to begin early and in high numbers. Between January\u2013March 2024, there have been more than 220 fires across Wisconsin.A 5.25-inch diameter hail stone fell in Ada, Oklahoma on March 14, which is the largest stone reported in Pontotoc County since 1950, as well as the largest to fall in the state in nearly 13 years.\nA state of emergency was declared for Ohio as several tornadoes struck the state, resulting in 3 fatalities on March 14 when an EF-3 tornado crossed Auglaize and Logan Counties.\nDrought\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor report, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nMonthly Outlook\nAbove-average temperatures are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast in April while above-average precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico. Visit the Climate Prediction Center\u2019s Official 30-Day Forecasts and U.S. Monthly Drought Outlook website for more details.\nSignificant wildland fire potential for April is above normal across much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains. For additional information on wildland fire potential, visit the National Interagency Fire Center\u2019s One-Month Wildland Fire Outlook.\nThis monthly summary from NOAA\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information is part of the suite of climate services NOAA provides to government, business, academia and the public to support informed decision-making.

Each participant\u2019s projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy\u2014including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value\u2014and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. \u201cAppropriate monetary policy\u201d is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.\nTable 1.

PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant\u2019s projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant\u2019s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 11\u201312, 2024.\n1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.\u00a0\u00a0Return to table\n3.

The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants\u2019 individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nThe confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants\u2019 current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.\n* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.\nTable 2.

As described in the box \"Forecast Uncertainty,\" under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), \"Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,\" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.\n1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. Return to table\n2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis. Return to table\n3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter. Return to table\nForecast Uncertainty\nThe economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for policy actions. Considerable uncertainty attends these projections, however. The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events. Thus, in setting the stance of monetary policy, participants consider not only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the poten- tial costs to the economy should they occur.\nTable 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy Reports and those prepared by the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts. For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent. If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past and the risks around the projections are broadly balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.6 to 4.4 percent in the current year, 1.2 to 4.8 percent in the second year, 0.9 to 5.1 percent in the third year, and 0.8 to 5.2 percent in the fourth year. The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.0 to 3.0 percent in the current year, 0.2 to 3.8 percent in the second and third years, and 0.3 to 3.7 percent in the fourth year. Figures 4.A through 4.C illustrate these confidence bounds in \u201cfan charts\u201d that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants\u2019 projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation. However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric. In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.\nBecause current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over history, participants provide judgments as to whether the uncertainty attached to their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C. Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projections are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures. Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks to their projections are weighted to the upside, are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced. That is, while the symmetric historical fan charts shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections. These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.\nAs with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty. This uncertainty arises primarily because each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time. If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward. The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates. They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide. It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an end-of-year basis. However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that would be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.\nIf at some point in the future the confidence interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would be truncated at zero for purposes of the fan chart shown in figure 5; zero is the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past. This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.\nWhile figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the uncertainty around the economic projections, figure 1 provides information on the range of views across FOMC participants. A comparison of figure 1 with figures 4.A through 4.C shows that the dispersion of the projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.\nBack to Top\nLast Update: September 18, 2024\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n\nAbout the Fed\nNews & Events\nMonetary Policy\nSupervision & Regulation\nFinancial Stability\nPayment Systems\nEconomic Research\nData\nConsumers & Communities\nConnect with the Board\n\nTools and Information\n\nContact\nPublications\nFreedom of Information (FOIA)\nOffice of Inspector General\nBudget & Performance | Audit\nNo FEAR Act\nEspa\u00f1ol\nWebsite Policies | Privacy Program\nAccessibility\n\nStay Connected\nFederal Reserve Facebook Page Federal Reserve Instagram Page Federal Reserve YouTube Page Federal Reserve Flickr Page Federal Reserve LinkedIn Page Federal Reserve Threads Page Link to Federal Reserve Twitter Page Subscribe to RSS Subscribe to Email\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\n20th Street and Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington, DC 20551"

County in million dollars\n\n    # Step 1: Sum the March temperature and PCE inflation projection\n    sum_temperature_inflation = march_temperature + pce_inflation_projection\n\n    # Step 2: Multiply the sum by the annual climate adaptation cost\n    answer = sum_temperature_inflation * annual_climate_adaptation_cost\n\n    return answer",

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

In the recorded time period, the highest occupancy rate was 78.8 percent back in 1969. Hospital occupancy rate has mostly decreased since then, even though the number of hospital beds has also decreased. In 2020, during the COVID pandemic, occupancy rate reached a historical low of 61.5 percent. The last time this occurred was in 1996.\nNumber of hospitals\nIn 2022, there were around 6,120 hospitals in operation in the U.S., compared to 6,291 hospitals in the year 1995. There has been a decline in the number of hospitals in the U.S. starting as far back as the 1970s, despite a growing overall population and increasing elderly population. Most hospitals in the U.S. are non-profit, while a smaller proportion are for-profit or state/government hospitals.\nEconomic impact\nHospitals contribute to an economy in many ways. In 2020, this total contribution in the U.S. was around 3.6 trillion dollars. At that time, hospitals contributed over 1.2 trillion dollars in wages and salaries. As of 2022, there were an estimated 7.32 million people employed in hospitals across the United States.\nRead more\nAcute care hospital bed occupancy rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2022\n| Characteristic | Hospital occupancy rate |\n| --- | --- |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\n| - | - |\nYou need a Statista Account for unlimited access\n\nImmediate access to 1m+ statistics\nIncl. source references\nDownload as PNG, PDF, XLS, PPT\n\nGet full access\nAlready have an account?\nLogin\nAdditional Information\n\u00a9 Statista 2024\nShow source\nDownload\nPDF+\nXLS+\nPNG+\nPPT+\nSource\nShow detailed source information?\nRegister for free\nAlready a member?\nLog in\nSource\nShow sources information Show publisher information Use Ask Statista Research Service\nRelease date\nJuly 2024\nMore information\nRegion\nUnited States\nSurvey time period\n1960 to 2022\nSupplementary notes\nRelease date represents the date figures were accessed.\nThe source adds the following:\u00a0The curative (acute) care occupancy rate is calculated as the number of beds effectively occupied (bed-days) for curative care (HC.1 in SHA classification) divided by the number of beds available for curative care multiplied by 365 days, with the ratio multiplied by 100.

Seven state hospitals were given \"D\" grades and one hospital earned an \"F\" rating. \nHospitals are ranked based on the number of infections, problems with surgeries, safety issues, staffing and measures aimed at preventing errors. \nThe \"F\" was given to South Shore Hospital in Chicago. \nThe hospital did not respond to NBC Chicago's requests, but was given low marks in some infection categories, hospital falls, error prevention strategies, and staffing and communication. \nSouth Shore CEO Leslie Rogers told the Chicago Tribune after stepping into a leadership role this summer, that the not-for-profit hospital was striving to have a \"C\" or better in the next ranking.\nLocal\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWoman shot and killed in northwest suburbs\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHere's what changes are coming to Social Security in 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nMeanwhile, more than half a dozen other facilities got \"D\" grades on the list. \nThat includes Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, Gateway Regional Medical Center in Granite City, Javon Bae Hospital in Rockford, Roseland Community Hospital in Chicago, Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center in Mattoon, Vista Medical Center East in Waukegan and Weiss Memorial Hospital in Chicago. \nWeiss Hospital told NBC Chicago in a statement that its low ranking was \"due to an increase in hospital acquired infections\" during earlier reporting periods. \n\"Since then, we have improved our processes and expect future scores, specifically Fall, to reflect those improvements,\" a spokesperson said. \"Patient safety is our highest priority, and our physicians and staff are fully committed to quality in our patient care activities.\" \nVista Health System said it \"improved during this rating period and continuously focuses on safety, quality, and our patients\u2019 experience\" but noted that data used in its grade \"is more than three years old in some cases and does not reflect the dedication and clinical performance of Vista\u2019s physicians, nurses, and staff.\"\n\"Several national and state agencies acknowledge Vista\u2019s commitment to quality and safety, including U.S. News and World Report, which recently recognized Vista as a high-performing hospital in stroke and COPD care for 2022-2023, and the American Heart Association and American Stroke Association, which recognized Vista with a 'Get with The Guidelines Stroke Gold Plus' achievement award with Target: Type 2 Diabetes Honor Roll,\" the healthcare company said. \nAdvocate Aurora Health said it has a \"robust plan in place to drive continued improvement in both safety and health outcomes for our patients.\"\n\"We firmly believe that meaningful quality and safety data should be transparent to the public. However, accurately measuring this data can be challenging, and some organizations use limited methodologies that don\u2019t always reflect the quality of care or the varied factors that contribute to patient outcomes,\" the hospital system said in a statement.\nNBC Chicago reached out to a number of other hospitals listed in the ranking but did not receive a response. \nSome prominent Chicago-area hospitals were also among the \"C\" ratings on the list, including Northwestern Medicine's Lake Forest Hospital, University of Illinois Hospital and Health Science System, a number of OSF HealthCare facilities, Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago and more.  \nNorthwestern Medicine said its Lake Forest Hospital \"is committed to providing high quality, safe, patient-centered care.\" \n\"Our physicians, nurses and staff are driven by their dedication and passion for delivering outstanding care while always striving to do what is better for our patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"We believe that quality and safety data should be meaningful, informative and transparent to the public. We appreciate the ongoing efforts by\u00a0Leapfrog\u00a0to improve the usefulness and accessibility of information for consumers.\"\nOSF HealthCare said 10 of its 15 hospitals received a grade in the report, one of which was given an A and five others given B's. \nIn total, four were given a C rating. \n\u201cOSF supports transparency about quality and safety information such as that provided through the Leapfrog grades and is committed to finding ways to improve safety and quality of care. We are proud of the work our Mission Partners (employees) do every day and how they have faced the many challenges of the past two years,\" the healthcare company said in a statement. \nIllinois ranked 28th in the U.S., with 26.5% of hospitals getting an \"A\" grade in the bi-annual report. In the spring, the state was listed at 27th. \nStill, in the fall of 2021, only 18 state hospitals were listed with an \"A\" grade. \nThe top-ranked state on the list was New Hampshire, followed by Virginia, Utah, Colorado and Idaho. \nHere's a look at which Illinois hospitals received an \"A\" grade: \nAdventHealth Bolingbrook - Bolingbrook, IL \nAdventHealth GlenOaks - Glendale Heights, IL\nAdventHealth Hinsdale - Hinsdale, IL \nAdventHealth La Grange - La Grange, IL\nAscension Mercy - Aurora, IL\nAscension Resurrection - Chicago, IL\nBlessing Hospital - Quincy, IL\nCarle Foundation Hospital- Urbana, IL \nElmhurst Memorial Hospital - Elmhurst, IL\nFHN Memorial Hospital - Freeport, IL\nHSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital - O'Fallon, IL\nLoyola Gottlieb Memorial Hospital - Melrose Park, IL \nMacNeal Hospital - Berwyn, IL \nMcDonough District Hospital - Macomb, IL \nMemorial Hospital Belleville - Belleville, IL \nMorris Hospital - Morris, IL \nNorthwest Community Hospital - Arlington Heights, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital - Winfield, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital - Geneva, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Huntley Hospital - Huntley, IL \nNorthwestern Medicine Kishwaukee Hospital - DeKalb, IL\nNorthwestern Medicine McHenry Hospital - McHenry, IL\nOSF HealthCare Saint Francis Medical Center - Peoria, IL \nRush Copley Medical Center - Aurora, IL\nRush Oak Park Hospital520 - Oak Park, IL \nRush University Medical Center - Chicago, IL \nSilver Cross Hospital - New Lenox, IL \nSSM Health St. Mary's Hospital-Centralia - Centralia, IL \nUnityPoint Health - Proctor - Peoria, IL \nUniversity of Chicago Medical Center - Chicago, IL\nSee the full list of hospital grades in Illinois here. \nTrending Stories\nWeather Forecast\n"

      "Signal Timing\n\u00a0\nWhy Correct Signal Timing is so Important\n(Read the Full Report)\nAt signalized intersections, the period between conflicting green phases is known as the change interval.\u00a0 It is composed of a yellow signal phase plus an optional all-red interval.\u00a0 The purpose of the yellow phase is to alert drivers that their right-of-way is about to end and, depending upon their relative proximity to the intersection, to permit them to come to a safe stop or allow them time to clear the limit line prior to the onset of the red phase. The purpose of the all-red interval is to allow vehicles which have lega1ly entered the intersection prior to the onset of the red signal to clear any potential points of conflict before the release of opposing vehicles or pedestrians.\nTransportation officials and engineers know that the proper timing of the change interval is essential to intersection safety.\u00a0 If the yellow signal phase is too short, a \u201cdilemma zone\u201d is created.\u00a0 Motorists who are unfortunate enough to be within this section of the roadway when the yellow signal illuminates may neither be able to stop safely nor legally enter the intersection before the onset of the red phase.\u00a0 Dilemma zones virtually assure that some percentage of drivers will be forced to brake suddenly or violate the red, thereby creating the potential for rear end collisions or vehicle conflicts within the intersection.\u00a0 If the all-red interval is insufficient, vehicles from the previous green phase may not have completely cleared the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Again, this generates the potential for vehicle conflicts including highly dangerous broadside collisions within the intersection.\nWhen both the yellow and all-red phases are too short, a significant safety hazard is created.\u00a0 Some drivers will be forced to violate the red due to the too-short yellow and cross traffic will be released before they completely clear the intersection. Intersections which exhibit a higher than average number of red-light related collisions most likely have either a yellow phase or all-red phase which is too short.\u00a0 Often times, both problems exist at the same intersection.\u00a0 Correcting the signal timing will most likely eliminate the vast majority of collisions at these locations.\nHow the Yellow Phase is Determined\nA mathematical formula established by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) is used to calculate the minimum safe time for the yellow signal and is primarily based on the speed of the traffic approaching the intersection and the reaction time of the average driver.\nThe ITE specifies the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic be used as the approach speed to ensure that the yellow phase provides sufficient stopping time for at least 85% of the vehicles approaching the intersection.\u00a0 California law requires the use of the 85th percentile speed or the posted speed limit.\u00a0 However, if the posted speed limit is used and the 85th percentile speed is substantially greater, then the yellow phase will be under-timed and a safety hazard will exist as a significant number of drivers will encounter a dilemma zone.\u00a0 For example, if the yellow signal is timed for 35 mph, the yellow light will be set at 3.6 seconds, but if the 85th percentile speed of traffic is 45 mph the yellow signal should be 4.3 seconds, too short by almost 1 full second.\u00a0 While this difference may not seem like much, it will often make the difference between whether or not a violation occurs.\nDriver perception-reaction time, is the time between the onset of the yellow phase and when the vehicle\u2019s brakes engage.\u00a0 During this time, the driver must see the light change from green to yellow, perceive the meaning of the change, decide whether they are able to safely stop or if they should continue through the intersection, and if they decide to stop, move their foot off the accelerator and apply the brakes. The ITE suggests that a value of 1 second be used for this variable.\u00a0 However, a number of studies suggest that this figure may not adequately account for driver perception-reaction times, especially in an urban environment such as Los Angeles due to \u201ccognitive overload\u201d where the reaction time may actually be closer to 1.5 seconds.\nMaximizing Safety through Longer Yellow Timing\nSafety dictates that the yellow signal time be calculated using the 85th percentile speed of free flow traffic approaching the intersection based on a current traffic survey.\u00a0 When a survey is unavailable, the 85th percentile speed should be assumed to be at least 10 mph above the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Likewise, in the interest of safety, driver reaction time should be assumed to be at least 1.4 seconds.\u00a0 Together, this change would likely increase the yellow time at many intersections by about 1 second and significantly improve safety.\nThe safety benefit of longer yellow signal times has been proven in a number of studies.\u00a0 A Texas DOT study found that when the yellow interval is set one second longer than the minimum time, violations decreased by 53% and crashes decreased by 40%.\nThe chart below shows a similar 30% to 55% reduction in violations achieved at San Diego red-light camera sites when the yellow interval times were increased.\n\nLikewise, the following two figures show how Fairfax County, VA achieved a significant, sustained reduction in violations when the yellow timing was increased\nby \u00bd second.\u00a0 Note also that red-light cameras were present during the entire review period, but a dramatic reduction in violations was seen only after the yellow timing was increased.\n\n\nAs for concerns that drivers will modify their behavior to account for the longer yellow light and still run the red, the data shows that such an adjustment does not happen provided the yellow time does not exceed about 5.5 seconds.\nHow the All-Red Clearance Phase is Determined\nThe ITE uses another formula to calculate the appropriate all-red phase which takes into consideration the width of the intersection and the speed of traffic. In contrast to the formula for the yellow signal timing this formula uses the speed of the slowest 15% of drivers to ensure that these vehicles have sufficient time to clear the intersection prior to the release of cross traffic.\u00a0 Generally the 15th percentile speed can be assumed to be 5 \u2013 10 mph below the posted speed limit.\nMaximizing Safety through a Longer All-Red Phase\nAs discussed previously, the purpose of the all-red phase is to allow vehicles that enter the intersection in the last moments of the yellow phase to clear the intersection prior to release of cross traffic or pedestrians.\u00a0 Wider intersections necessarily require longer all-red phases.\u00a0 A vehicle traveling at 35 mph will require just over 2 seconds to clear an intersection 90 feet wide and 2.83 seconds to completely clear an intersection 125 feet wide.\u00a0 Slower vehicles would require more time to clear those intersections.\u00a0 These clearance intervals provide a sufficient all-red phase to clear any vehicles that cross the limit line just as the signal changes from yellow to red.\u00a0 However, in real world situations, some drivers will enter the intersection just after the signal turns to red.\u00a0 This is often due to yellow times that are too short, drivers who simply miscalculate the time it will take them to reach the limit line before the yellow phase ends, or drivers who hesitate or slow momentarily before deciding they have sufficient time to make it into the intersection before the red illuminates.\u00a0\u00a0 The 2004 Texas DOT study determined that when a red light violation occurs, about 60 percent of the time it occurs within the first half second of the red phase.\u00a0 The distribution of red light violations as a function of time-into-red appears in the figure below.\n\nIn order to minimize the chance that collisions will occur at signalized intersections, the all-red clearance interval must be long enough to allow all vehicles to clear the intersection before cross traffic is released.\u00a0 This interval should be extended slightly to account for vehicles that enter the intersection just after the red phase begins.\u00a0 For example, a vehicle traveling at 35 mph would require approximately 2 seconds to clear an 80 foot wide intersection.\u00a0 However, if the driver miscalculates or hesitates and enters the intersection \u00bd second after the light turns red, his vehicle will not completely clear the intersection until 2.5 seconds after the red phase begins.\u00a0 In this situation, the 2 second all-red clearance interval dictated by the ITE formula would not be sufficient to prevent a possible vehicle conflict within the intersection.\u00a0 While it may not be desirable to increase the all-red phase to account for every vehicle that might enter the intersection after the red phase begins, extending the all-red phase \u00bd second beyond the time calculated using the ITE formula would prevent collisions that might be caused by the 60% of violations that occur immediately after the onset of red.\u00a0 This could add an additional measure of safety without unduly reducing traffic flow.\nExisting Conditions at Los Angeles Intersections\nAs part of an ongoing study of traffic safety in Los Angeles, Safer Streets L.A. identified intersections within the city with a higher than average number of red-light related collisions.\u00a0 Without exception, we found that either the yellow time, the all-red phase or both are currently below the ITE minimums based on the actual speed of traffic at these locations and therefore insufficient to provide the margin of safety necessary to protect the motoring public.\u00a0 In some cases the yellow signal time is 1 full second too short and the all-red phase is a much as 2 seconds too short.\nUnquestionably, at intersections where red-light related accidents are over represented, an engineering deficiency exists.\u00a0 As explained above, drivers in an urban environment such as L.A. may need additional reaction time to respond to the yellow signal and routinely travel at 10 mph or more beyond the posted speed limit.\u00a0 Therefore, it would be prudent to extend the yellow signal time at least 1 second and extend the all-red clearance interval at least 0.5 seconds beyond the ITE minimums.\u00a0 Additional engineering improvements may be necessary at some intersections to be determined based on a comprehensive engineering survey.\nThe City of Los Angeles now has an economical option available that would achieve a greater safety benefit than the proposed multi-million dollar red-light camera program.\u00a0 The cost to change signal timing is insignificant.\u00a0 The City can swiftly achieve a reduction in accidents as well as violations at numerous signalized intersections simply by extending the yellow and all-red signal phases.\u00a0 There is no reason not to immediately implement these strategies at problem intersections.\u00a0 Failure to do so not only puts the motoring public at risk, it leaves the City open to the possibility of litigation should injuries or fatalities occur due to deficient signal timing.\n(Read the Full Report)\nJoin the National Motorists Association to learn more and continue the fight for your driving rights.\n\nYour donation is tax deductible.\nRecent

      "MOTOR\nResults for {phrase}\n\nAutomotive Data since 1903\n\nDealer Service Satisfaction Improves but Appointment Wait Times Continue to Grow\nDealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments\nBy J.D. Power\nTroy, Mich.\u2014While customer satisfaction with the dealer service experience has rebounded this year, dealers continue to grapple with parts and labor shortages that are fueling longer wait times for appointments, according to the J.D. Power 2024 U.S. Customer Service Index (CSI) Study. Overall customer service satisfaction improves five points to 851 (on a 1,000-point scale).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see an improvement in service satisfaction but, unfortunately, the capacity and wait time issues have gotten progressively worse since the pandemic and show no immediate signs of easing up,\u201d said\u00a0Chris Sutton, vice president of automotive retail at J.D. Power. \u201cExcluding Tesla owners, the service experience for BEV owners is underwhelming. As sales of BEVs continue to grow and the industry moves out of the early-adopter phase, the typical owner will not be as willing to tolerate a less-than-stellar service and ownership experience.\n\n\u201cOn the manufacturer side, a higher rate of BEV recalls is also contributing to an inconsistent experience. This is an area that automakers and dealers need to address now to help make the transition to electrification as pain-free as possible for owners in the future.\u201d\nContributing to the poor service experience of non-Tesla BEV owners is a notable lack of trust with servicing dealers to perform complex repairs and provide useful guidance. Overall dealer trust among non-Tesla BEV owners is 5.62 (on a 7-point scale) but jumps to 6.00 among owners of gas-powered vehicles owners and 5.74 among plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners.\n\nThe study, now in its 44th\u00a0year, has grown to include emerging features such as valet service, mobile vehicle servicing and online/smartphone app payment options to gauge the effect these processes have on the service experience. The study measures satisfaction with service at franchised dealer or aftermarket service facilities for maintenance or repair work among owners and lessees of one- to three-year-old vehicles.\nIt also provides a numerical index ranking of the highest-performing automotive brands sold in the United States, which is based on the combined scores of five measures that comprise the vehicle owner service experience. These measures are (in order of importance): service quality; service advisor; vehicle pick-up; service facility; and service initiation. In 2023, model segment rankings were added to the study to differentiate between the service needs of cars, trucks, SUVs and minivans.\nFollowing are key findings of the 2024 study:\nHighest-Ranking Brands and Segments\n\u2022 Lexus\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among premium brands for a third consecutive year, with a score of 897.\u00a0Porsche\u00a0(894) ranks second and\u00a0Cadillac\u00a0(883) ranks third.\n\u2022 Buick\u00a0ranks highest in satisfaction with dealer service among mass market brands with a score of 887.\u00a0MINI\u00a0(884) ranks second and\u00a0Subaru\u00a0(877) ranks third.\n\u2022 MINI (877) ranks highest in the mass market car segment, followed by Subaru (874) and\u00a0Mazda\u00a0(867).\n\u2022 Buick ranks highest among mass market SUVs/minivans with a score of 887.\u00a0Mitsubishi\u00a0(877) and Subaru (877) each rank second in a tie.\n\u2022 Porsche (902) ranks highest in the premium car segment, followed by\u00a0Infiniti\u00a0(900) and Lexus (892).\n\u2022 Lexus ranks highest in the premium SUV segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 898. Porsche (889) ranks second and Cadillac (882) ranks third.Nissan\u00a0ranks highest in the truck segment for a second consecutive year, with a score of 873.\u00a0Chevrolet\u00a0(856) ranks second and\u00a0Toyota\u00a0(855) ranks third.\n\n\n\n\nNo results found.\nGet The Newsletter\ncontact a sales person\nSupport Center\nMOTOR Magazine\n\u00a9 2024 Hearst Business Publishing, Inc. | \r\n                         Privacy policy | \r\n                         MEDIA | \r\n                         Black Book\n"

      "Boston Subway Map 2024 \u2013 Timetable, Tickets & Prices\n  \nSubway Boston (MTBA) \u2013 The route network\nThe Boston subway is a true monument to American history. The metro system is the oldest subway in the USA. It opened on September 1, 1887, just before the Chicago subway.\nOpened at the time as the \u201cStreet Subway\u201d, the route is still part of the so-called Green Line with the oldest subway tunnel in the USA. Alongside the three modern metro lines, it is a special feature on the Boston Metro Map. The Green Line is actually an S-Bahn line, but a large part of it runs underground. At 37 kilometers, it is not only the longest, but also the busiest subway line in Boston, carrying around 230,000 passengers a day.\nAll lines are operated by Massachusetts Bay Transportation (MBTA). The subway network, affectionately known by Bostonians as \u201cThe T\u201d or \u201cBoston T\u201d, stretches over a total length of around 120.3 kilometers. With 200,000 passengers per day, the Orange Line has the second largest passenger volume after the Green Line. The metro lines on the Boston Metro Map can only be distinguished by their color. To avoid confusion with other public transport lines, travelers should therefore remember the Red Line, the Blue Line, the Orange Line and the Green Line.\nInhaltsverzeichnis\nThe Boston subway lines at a glance\nInformation for tourists about the Boston Metro\nBoston owes its popularity as a travel destination and place to work and study not least to its famous universities. Harvard University and the New England Conservatory are particularly famous. However, it is not just students and commuters who use the transportation services of the \u201cBoston T\u201d. There are also plenty of tourists who want to see historically significant sites such as the Old State House, the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall or the USS Constitution.\nAccordingly, the number of people in Boston who use the Metro Map is also increasing. This is comparatively easy to accomplish due to the small number of lines. The most important connection for tourists is undoubtedly the Blue Line between the airport and the city center at the Government Center stop.\nBoston subway tickets & prices\nWith a population of just over 600,000, Boston is not exactly a small town. Nevertheless, the simplicity of the tariff system is very reminiscent of this. Instead of a complex system with several tariff zones, a flat-rate billing system is used. This also makes it much easier for non-residents to use the metro in Boston. This also limits the choice of tickets to a minimum.\nThey are valid for both the subway and the bus lines. In addition to one-way tickets, the operating company MTBA only offers daily, weekly and monthly tickets. Tickets are cheaper for senior citizens, the disabled and students. Boston\u2019s subway is also very family-friendly. Children up to the age of 11 can travel free of charge on the metro.\nThe most important metro tickets in Boston\nIf you want to buy a metro ticket in Boston, you have several options. The most common option is to buy classic paper tickets, known as Charlie tickets. They are available from the ticket machines in front of the entrances to the subway platforms. If there is no ticket machine and validator to be found on a subway platform, tickets can often also be purchased on board the trains. However, only tickets with a value of up to 20 US dollars can be purchased at the ticket machines on board.\nUsing the CharlieCard is much more convenient. This is a rechargeable chip card that can be used to book tickets and also serves as a travel pass. It can be used as a one-way ticket, day ticket, weekly ticket and monthly ticket. The CharlieCard is particularly attractive because of the discount on the price of single trips. The CharlieCard is also validated or activated at the electronic access barriers to the platforms. There are no smartphone tickets for the metro in Boston, nor are there any special combined tickets for tourists. Such tickets are usually associated with discounts for attractions.\nBoston subway schedule\nThe Green Line starts its service at around 5:00 am. Service on the three remaining lines on the Boston Metro Map begins between 5:15 and 5:30 a.m. This regulation applies on the Green Line and Blue Line seven days a week. On the Red Line and the Orange Line, however, the first trains on Sundays do not depart until an hour later at around 6:00 am. Both during the week and at weekends, all lines run until around 1:00 a.m. or 1:30 a.m. at night.\nThe frequency of the four metro lines on the Boston Metro Map varies throughout the day between a 3-minute interval during rush hour and a 9-15-minute interval in the late evening and night hours. So if you want to be out and about in Boston after 1:00 a.m., you have to use one of the city\u2019s many cabs or the Uber service.\nRed Line, Orange Line, Blue Line, Green Line\nFurther information on the Boston Metro\nThe saying \u201cother countries, other customs\u201d applies not only to the USA in general, but also to the metro in Boston. There are some rules that may seem strange to the average European at first. Eating on the Boston subway is not prohibited, but if the food smells too strong, the employees of the operating company can issue a warning. Incidentally, no one should put up any resistance, as these employees are official security guards from the MBTA Police Department.\nSo safety on board is also well taken care of. Very loud conversations that disturb the other passengers are also worthy of a warning. Playing music loudly is prohibited both at subway stations and on the trains themselves. No less unusual is the clear permission to put your feet up on the seat, provided the subway carriage is largely empty.\n (No Ratings Yet)Loading...\n",

Provisional estimates are published quarterly and remain provisional until after they have been constrained by the final annual estimates each year. These provisional estimates are based on traffic data collected continuously from a network of around 300 automatic traffic counters. Final annual figures also incorporate manual traffic count data.\nTraffic shows a seasonal pattern at the national level, being highest in summer and lowest in winter. This publication focuses on rolling annual traffic totals, which better illustrate medium and long term trends in traffic.\nAnnual traffic estimates are usually published between May and June of the following year. The next provisional figures, for the year ending June 2024, are due to be released in September 2024.\nThese are accredited official statistics[footnote 1] and were independently reviewed by the Office for Statistics Regulation in February 2013. For more information, see the background information on provisional road traffic estimates.\nHeadline figures\nOverall traffic levels in the year ending March 2024 were higher than in year ending March 2023 and below pre-pandemic levels.\nChart 1: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 1 is a line chart showing that 332.4 billion vehicle miles were driven on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was up 2.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motor vehicle traffic levels fell during the pandemic but have since increased. This is the case for all vehicle types and road types. Traffic levels for the year ending March 2024 were 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad traffic by vehicle type\nChart 2: Share of traffic by vehicle type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 2 is a bar chart which shows that cars accounted for 76% of all motor vehicle traffic on Great Britain\u2019s roads over the year ending March 2024. Therefore, cars continue to be the main contributor to changes in overall motor vehicle traffic.\nThe proportion of van traffic has increased in recent years, accounting for 18% of all motor vehicle traffic in this 12 month period.\nLorries accounted for 5% of all motor vehicle traffic and 1% of traffic came from other motor vehicles including motorcycles and buses.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 1: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by vehicle type in the year ending March 2024, and percentage change compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2501a)\nTable 1 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different vehicle types. For example, car and taxi traffic was 2.6% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nCars and taxis\nChart 3: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by cars and taxis in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 3 is a line chart which illustrates that cars and taxis travelled 252.5 billion vehicle miles in the 12 months ending March 2024. Car and taxi traffic rose 2.6% from the year ending March 2023. Car and taxi miles for the year ending March 2024 were down by 4.0% compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nVans (Light Commercial Vehicles - LCVs)\nChart 4: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by vans in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 4 is a line chart which shows that 58.2 billion vehicle miles were driven by vans on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was a rise of 1.1% compared to the year ending March 2023. Van distance travelled for the year ending March 2024 was 8.8% higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nLorries (Heavy Goods Vehicles - HGVs)\nChart 5: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled by lorries in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2501a)\nChart 5 is a line chart showing that 16.9 billion vehicle miles were driven by lorries on Great Britain\u2019s roads in the 12 month period ending March 2024. Lorry traffic decreased by 2.0% compared to the year ending March 2023. Distance covered by lorries for the year ending March 2024 was 1.7% below pre-pandemic levels. The chart shows that the pandemic had a lesser effect on total lorry traffic than other vehicle types. Between the years ending December 2019 and December 2020, lorry traffic only fell by 5.9%, while car and van traffic fell by 24.9% and 9.2% respectively.\nRoad traffic by road type\nChart 6: Share of traffic by road type for the year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 6 is a bar chart displaying that on Great Britain\u2019s roads, in the year ending March 2024, 21% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on motorways, 44% on \u2018A\u2019 roads, and 35% on minor roads. 65% of motor vehicle miles travelled were on major roads (motorways and \u2018A\u2019 roads) despite comprising only 13% of the road network by length.\nIn the year ending March 2024:\nTable 2: Vehicle miles travelled in Great Britain by road type in the year ending March 2024 compared to previous 12 month periods (from TRA2502a)\nTable 2 shows how traffic in the year ending March 2024 compares to a selection of earlier years for different road types. For example, motorway traffic was 1.9% higher in the year ending March 2024 than the year ending March 2023. Note that any differences between -0.5% and +0.5% are considered negligible.\nMotorways\nChart 7: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on motorways in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 7 is a line chart illustrating that 70.1 billion vehicle miles were driven on motorways in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This was an increase of 1.9% compared to the year ending March 2023. Motorway traffic for the year ending March 2024 was similar to pre-pandemic levels.\n\u2018A\u2019 roads\nChart 8: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 8 is a line chart which shows 146.5 billion vehicle miles were driven on \u2018A\u2019 roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 2.6% rise from the year ending March 2023. Traffic on \u2018A\u2019 roads for the year ending March 2024 was 2.5% lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nMinor roads\nChart 9: Rolling annual vehicle miles travelled on minor roads in Great Britain, from year ending March 2018 to year ending March 2024 (from TRA2502a)\nChart 9 is a line chart showing that 115.8 billion vehicle miles were driven on minor roads in Great Britain in the 12 month period ending March 2024. This represents a 1.6% increase from the year ending March 2023. Distance travelled on minor roads for the year ending March 2024 was 1.8% below pre-pandemic levels.\nBackground information\nGlossary\nFurther information\nA background quality report has been published for these statistics.

Consider that in March 2024, cars in Great Britain traveled 252.5 billion miles, and New York had an estimated 2.9 million subway riders benefiting from weekend enhancements. What would be the result if the passengers per kilometer on the Green Line were multiplied by the car traffic in billion miles and then divided by the number of New York subway riders benefiting from weekend enhancements?",

      "Allianz\nTrade\nAllianz\nTrade\nAllianz Risk Barometer : Identifying the major business risks for 2024\nExecutive SummaryExecutive Summary\nCyber incidents such as ransomware attacks, data breaches, and IT disruptions are the biggest worry for companies globally in 2024, according to the Allianz Risk Barometer. The closely interlinked peril of Business interruption ranks second. Natural catastrophes (up from #6 to #3 year-on-year), Fire, explosion (up from #9 to #6), and Political risks and violence (up from #10 to #8) are the biggest risers in the latest compilation of the top global business risks, based on the insights of more than 3,000 risk management professionals.\nThe top risks and major risers in this year\u2019s Allianz Risk Barometer reflect the big issues facing companies around the world right now \u2013 digitalization, climate change and an uncertain geopolitical environment. Many of these risks are already hitting home, with extreme weather, ransomware attacks and regional conflicts expected to test the resilience of supply chains and business models further in 2024. Brokers and customers of insurance companies should be aware and adjust their insurance covers accordingly.\nLarge corporates, mid-size, and smaller businesses are united by the same risk concerns \u2013 they are all mostly worried about cyber, business interruption and natural catastrophes. However, the resilience gap between large and smaller companies is widening, as risk awareness among larger organizations has grown since the pandemic with a notable drive to upgrade resilience, the report notes. Conversely, smaller businesses often lack the time and resources to identify and effectively prepare for a wider range of risk scenarios and, as a result, take longer to get the business back up and running after an unexpected incident.\nTrends driving cyber activity in 2024\nCyber incidents (36% of overall responses) rank as the most important risk globally for the third year in a row \u2013 for the first time by a clear margin (5% points). It is the top peril in 17 countries, including Australia, France, Germany, India, Japan, the UK, and the USA. A data breach is seen as the most concerning cyber threat for Allianz Risk Barometer respondents (59%) followed by attacks on critical infrastructure and physical assets (53%). The recent increase in ransomware attacks \u2013 2023 saw a worrying resurgence in activity, with insurance claims activity up by more than 50% compared with 2022 \u2013 ranks third (53%).\nCyber criminals are exploring ways to use new technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (AI) to automate and accelerate attacks, creating more effective malware and phishing. The growing number of incidents caused by poor cyber security, in mobile devices in particular, a shortage of millions of cyber security professionals, and the threat facing smaller companies because of their reliance on IT outsourcing are also expected to drive cyber activity in 2024.\nBusiness interruption and natural catastrophes\nDespite an easing of post-pandemic supply chain disruption in 2023, Business interruption (31%) retains its position as the second biggest threat in the 2024 survey. This result reflects the interconnectedness in an increasingly volatile global business environment, as well as a strong reliance on supply chains for critical products or services. Improving business continuity management, identifying supply chain bottlenecks, and developing alternative suppliers continue to be key risk management priorities for companies in 2024.\nNatural catastrophes (26%) is one of the biggest movers at #3, up three positions. 2023 was a record-breaking year on several fronts. It was the hottest year since records began, while insured losses exceeded US$100bn for the fourth consecutive year, driven by the highest ever damage bill of US$60bn from severe thunderstorms. Around the world, natural catastrophes is the #1 risk in Croatia, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Slovenia, and Thailand, many of which sustained some of the most significant events of 2023. In Greece, a wildfire near the city of Alexandroupolis in August was the largest ever recorded in the EU. Meanwhile, severe flooding in Slovenia resulted in one of the biggest supply chain events, causing production delays and parts shortages for European car manufacturers.\nRegional differences and risk risers and fallers\nClimate change (18%) may be a non-mover year-on-year at #7 but is among the top three business risks in countries such as Brazil, Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Mexico. Physical damage to corporate assets from more frequent and severe extreme weather events are a key threat. The utility, energy and industrial sectors are among the most exposed. In addition, net zero transition risks and liability risks are expected to increase in future as companies invest in new, largely untested low-carbon technologies to transform their business models.\nUnsurprisingly, given ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, and tensions between China and the US, Political risks and violence (14%) is up to #8 from #10. 2024 is also a super-election year, where as much as 50% of the world\u2019s population could go to the polls, including in India, Russia, the US, and UK. Dissatisfaction with the potential outcomes, coupled with general economic uncertainty, the high cost of living, and growing disinformation fueled by social media, means societal polarization is expected to increase, triggering more social unrest in many countries.\nHowever, there is some hope among Allianz Risk Barometer respondents that 2024 could see the wild economic ups and down experienced since the Covid-19 shock settle down, resulting in Macroeconomic developments (19%), falling to #5 from #3. Yet economic growth outlooks remain subdued \u2013 just over 2% globally in 2024, according to Allianz Research.\nBut this lackluster growth is a necessary evil: high inflation rates will finally be a thing of the past. This will give central banks some room to maneuver \u2013 lower interest rates are likely in the second half of the year. Not a second too late, as stimulus cannot be expected from fiscal policy. A caveat is the considerable number of elections in 2024 and the risk of further upheavals depending on certain outcomes.\nIn a global context, the shortage of skilled workforce (12%) is seen as a lower risk than in 2023, dropping from #8 to #10. However, businesses in Central and Eastern Europe, the UK and Australia identify it as a top five business risk. Given there is still record low unemployment in many countries around the globe, companies are looking to fill more jobs than there are people available to fill them. IT or data experts are seen as the most challenging to find, making this issue a critical aspect in the fight against cyber-crime.\nContact\nHugo Kidston\nAllianz Commercial\nFollow us\nEOLIS\u00a0\u2192\nBonding Portal\u00a0\u2192\nEOLIS\u00a0\u2192\nBonding Portal\u00a0\u2192",

The goal is to proactively manage potential risks and minimize their impact on the organization\u2019s operations, financial performance, and reputation.\nSupplier risk management can be abbreviated as SRM, but should not be confused with supplier relationship management.\n\nLet\u2019s go through all the other key definitions and concepts you should understand as a procurement professional managing supplier risk.\nWhat exactly is supplier risk?\nSupplier risk refers to the potential negative impacts that can arise from relying on (or association with) suppliers or third parties that provide goods and services. These risks can disrupt a company\u2019s operations, financial performance, reputation, or regulatory compliance.\nSupplier risks can sometimes be the result of external factors (like political instability in a country) or market factors (for example, excessive concentration of suppliers.)\nKey supplier risk factors to include in your risk assessment\nIn episode 28 of the Art of Procurement podcast I shared the top eight supplier-related risk factors:\n\nGeopolitical risk: The risk that political instability, trade tensions, regulatory changes, or other government actions in a supplier\u2019s country could disrupt supply.\nConcentration risk: Overreliance on a single supplier or small number of suppliers for critical inputs, creating vulnerability to disruption.\nStrategic risk: The risk a supplier relationship fails to meet strategic objectives or a supplier\u2019s actions strategically damage the buyer.\nReputational risk: The risk a supplier\u2019s actions or association could harm the buying organization\u2019s brand and reputation.\nCompliance risk: The risk a supplier fails to comply with relevant laws, regulations and standards, exposing the buyer to negative press or legal consequences.\nOperational risk: The risk a supplier experiences operational failures or issues that impact their ability to reliably deliver goods and services.\nFinancial risk: The risk a supplier becomes financially insolvent or experiences financial distress that impacts their viability and performance.\nContractual risk: Risks arising from unfavorable, incomplete, inflexible or unenforceable contract terms and conditions with a supplier.\n\nThe scope, severity, and likelihood of negative impacts can vary widely by supplier or the criticality of the product or service being purchased. In an interconnected supply chain, even small supplier issues can cascade into major company problems. Proactively identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and mitigating supplier risks is important in today\u2019s procurement operations.\nHow does supplier risk management work?\nSupplier risk management is a key effort performed by today\u2019s digitalized and networked procurement teams.\nAs businesses have more business units, outsourced resources and external partners, the risks to business continuity are greater. Depending on the industry the company is in and their level of maturity, they may have a dedicated risk organization that procurement engages with and supports, or procurement may own risk management alongside their other activities.\nSupplier risk management typically involves:\n\nIdentifying potential risks related to suppliers, such as financial instability, operational disruptions, compliance issues, and reputational damage.\nAssessing the likelihood and potential impact of each identified risk.\nDeveloping strategies to mitigate or eliminate the identified risks, such as diversifying the supplier base, implementing strict contractual terms, enhancing supplier monitoring, or prequalifying alternate sources of supply.\nContinuously monitoring suppliers for any changes in their risk profile and adapting risk management strategies accordingly.\n\nBy implementing a comprehensive supplier risk management program, you can ensure a more stable and resilient supply chain, reduce the likelihood of disruptions, and protect the bottom line and reputation of your business.\nWhy is supplier risk management important?\nIn a notable AOP Live session with Gordon Donovan and Matthew Montgomery of SAP we discussed how risk management is both a C-suite priority and driver of procurement strategy. Here are a few key takeaways pointing to the importance of supplier risk management.\nLack of supplier visibility beyond Tier 1\nIn an increasingly networked global supply chain, suppliers are often categorized into tiers based on their proximity to the final product or service. Tier 1 suppliers are the companies that directly provide goods or services to the purchasing organization. Tier 2 suppliers are the key suppliers to the Tier 1 suppliers, providing them with critical components, services, or raw materials. Tier 3 suppliers are the suppliers to Tier 2 suppliers, and so on through the chain.. While Tier 1 suppliers are the most visible and directly managed, risks and disruptions often cascade from issues at lower tiers, making multi-tier visibility and risk management crucial. A 2022 study by Deloitte and CIPS found that 44% of private sector companies still lack visibility of their suppliers beyond tier 2.\nConcerns about cyber risk from suppliers\nAccording to PwC research, cybersecurity is a key source of risk that is concerning to CEOs and the C-suite. If managing cybersecurity is challenging within a business unit, it\u2019s even more complicated through a network of service providers and outsourcing partners. Procurement is being asked more about how they assess suppliers\u2019 cyber-controls, physical security, employee access, and breach response plans.\nSupply chain vulnerabilities\nSupply chain disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 Suez Canal obstruction revealed that many companies were underprepared for supply risk scenarios. While the impact of the pandemic is largely over, it highlighted the importance and visibility of proactive supplier risk management. Procurement plays a key role in helping their company be more resilient to future shocks.\nRisk is multi-faceted beyond just financial factors\nWhile the financial stability of suppliers is important, procurement must also monitor for operational risks (e.g. labor strikes), compliance (e.g. bribery), geopolitical (e.g. trade disputes), reputational (e.g. ESG issues), and other risk dimensions. As a procurement leader you need to take a holistic view on risk.\nCategory risk is key, not just supplier-level risk\nThe inherent risks in what is being purchased (e.g. IT system access, hazardous materials) are often more critical than the specific supplier. Procurement should assess category risk profiles first to prioritize where to focus supplier risk efforts.\nRapid response to disruptions is vital\nWhen supply chain disruptions hit, procurement\u2019s ability to quickly assess impacts, activate alternate sources, and implement other mitigations is crucial. Risk planning must have a \u201cneed for speed\u201d mindset. Initiatives that strengthen agility pay off during disruptions.\nThese examples illustrate why procurement taking a proactive, rigorous approach to assessing and managing a wide spectrum of supplier risks is becoming a greater expectation of the C-suite to protect the company\u2019s performance.\nHow to integrate risk into your strategic sourcing process\nIn episode 38 of the Art of Procurement podcast I offer a number of practical tips for embedding supplier risk management into your strategic sourcing processes.\n1. Assess first which purchases pose risk and which don\u2019t\nNot every supplier needs to be actively monitored for risk, as it may not be feasible or necessary across your full supply base. It will help to have a consistent process to determine which suppliers or categories to monitor more closely.\nRemember \u2013 risk can be inherent to what is being purchased, regardless of the supplier. For example, services requiring access to confidential data or critical components with long lead times present risks. On the other hand, purchases like office supplies typically pose minimal risk.\n2. Segment suppliers into risk levels\nAt the start of the sourcing process, purchases can be segmented and assigned a risk levels based on factors like access to confidential data, criticality to business operations, ability to quickly replace the supplier, offshoring, outsourcing, and materiality of spend.\nThe risk level drives which factors need to be measured and mitigated during sourcing. Having a product/service taxonomy with predefined risk ratings can streamline this effort.\n3. Consider supplier-level risk assessments\nYou\u2019re likely to need supplier-level risk assessment if a purchase is deemed sufficiently high risk. This helps identify specific supplier risks to mitigate through the sourcing process.\nRisk is also related to the controls and processes the specific supplier has in place during your engagements with them. Suppliers with robust controls may require less monitoring compared to those with less documented controls.\n4. Keep your processes consistent with your spend taxonomy\nIf you want to make risk management programmatic, then you want to have a consistent approach that helps you identify, manage, and mitigate risk across your entire supply base.\nYou may want to categorize types of spend by risk level in a product/service taxonomy. This allows predefined risk ratings to be applied to new purchases in the same category, streamlining the process for any new spend or suppliers.\nBottom line on Supplier Risk Management\nIn today\u2019s interconnected and volatile business landscape, supplier risk management has evolved to a core strategic capability for effective procurement teams. Disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic and Suez Canal obstruction painfully proved that a company\u2019s performance and resilience are only as strong as its weakest supplier link.\nProcurement leaders who proactively identify, prioritize, and mitigate risks across their supplier base will be best positioned to safeguard their business from future supply chain shocks. This requires a strategic approach blending risk awareness, robust processes, and collaborative supplier relationships. You can\u2019t avoid all supplier risk, but you can prepare for the unexpected.\nRelated Articles and Resources\n\nDefining and Driving a World-Class Supplier Risk Management Program\nImplementing a Framework Around Global Supplier Risks\nRelationship Building: The Key to Effective Risk Management in Procurement\nWhen Third Party Risk is a First Tier Priority\nWhy Dual Sourcing as a Risk Mitigation Strategy May Not Be the Answer\n\nNever miss a podcast or article!

Before digging into the\u00a02024 Geostrategic Outlook (pdf), let\u2019s first look back at the past year. How closely did the expectations in the\u00a02023 Geostrategic Outlook\u00a0align with reality?\nAbout the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook\nThe annual Geostrategic Outlook presents analysis by the EY Geostrategic Business Group (GBG) on the global political risk environment in the year ahead.\nTo select the top 10 geopolitical developments in the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook, the GBG first conducted a crowdsourced horizon scanning exercise to identify potential political risks. The crowdsourced inputs came from dozens of subject matter resources across EY teams, including those focused on public policy, strategy, macro trends and sector-level developments across all geographical regions. This scan encompassed the four categories of political risk in the geostrategy framework \u2014 geopolitical, country, regulatory and societal \u2014 throughout all regions of the world. The GBG then identified additional developments through interviews with subject matter resources in other political risk organizations.\nNext, the GBG assessed all the identified political risks along two dimensions: their probability of occurring and the degree to which they would have impact on companies across sectors and geographies globally. This impact assessment is aligned with the second step in implementing a geostrategy. The top 10 geopolitical developments included in this Outlook are those that were assessed to be both high probability and high impact, broadly speaking for global companies.\nThe past year was yet another in which businesses faced an extraordinary collection of geopolitical events and deepening trends. Many geopolitical developments unfolded largely as we expected. \u201cStabilized volatility\u201d \u2013 one of the overarching themes we identified in our 2023 Geostrategic Outlook \u2013 proved an apt description of geopolitical tensions and government intervention in economies persisting and plateauing at an elevated level. However, geopolitical tensions began to rise again in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Middle East \u2013 a region that we had not included in our top 10 developments for 2023.\nOur second overarching theme from 2023 also stood the test of time: governments around the world faced a variety of \u201cpolicy trade-offs.\u201d Among the most consequential and dynamic policy areas has been energy security and associated sustainability concerns. Climate policy continues to reign near the top of the agenda for many governments, culminating in the recent 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in the UAE. However, central banks and fiscal policymakers managed the inflation-recession paradox better than had been expected. And we did not foresee how rapidly generative artificial intelligence (AI) would emerge, so it was a surprise that regulation of AI jumped to the top of the agenda.\nLooking ahead, many of the themes and developments from 2023 will continue to play out in 2024.\nDownload the full 2024 Geostrategic Outlook\nOne defining feature of the geopolitical environment in 2024 will be multipolarity. A greater number of powerful actors will shape an increasingly complex global system. As great powers, the EU, the US and China will continue to shape the global operating environment in profound ways. Geopolitical swing states \u2013 countries such as India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil that are not specifically aligned with any major power or bloc \u2013 will gain more sway over the international agenda.\nHow EY can help\nGeostrategic Business Group\nOur Geostrategic Business Group (GBG) can help your business translate geopolitical insights into business strategy to manage political risk. Find out how.\nSmaller countries and non-state actors will also seize on opportunities to redraw boundaries or otherwise shape their corner of the geopolitical multiverse. The war in Ukraine and geopolitical conflicts that have flared up in several other parts of the world may only be the beginning.\nThe second defining feature of geostrategy in 2024 will be de-risking. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine highlighted countries\u2019 global dependencies and the challenges in achieving resilience with just-in-time and globalized supply chains \u2013 especially when production was concentrated in a small number of markets.\nGovernments have responded by reengaging in or expanding their reliance on industrial policy. They are seeking to promote greater domestic production of critical products. In certain markets, geopolitical competition has already been embedded with these industrial policies. We will see more of this explicit connection between economic policy and foreign or national security policies in the year ahead.\nBuilding on its momentum in 2023, the geopolitics of AI will become more important in 2024. Governments will race to regulate AI to reduce the potential of sociopolitical risks. But policymakers will simultaneously try to foster domestic AI innovation to compete geopolitically. As a result, AI will be a central dynamic in US-China relations. In 2024, the dual races to innovate and regulate AI will accelerate the shift toward distinct geopolitical blocs.\nBut 2024 will also be different in several important ways. The geopolitics of the oceans will feature more prominently in the global zeitgeist. The oceans are home to 94% of all life on our planet, and they are an increasingly important economic and national security resource. A staggering 90% of global goods trade is shipped via maritime routes, but many of the world\u2019s busiest maritime transit corridors are at risk of geopolitical disruption. And deep-sea mining is forecast to account for at least one-third of the supply of critical minerals necessary for the energy transition. Companies will need to take ocean geopolitics into account when setting their supply chain and sustainability strategies.\nAnd 2024 will be a year of elections \u2013 we call it the global elections supercycle. Voters will go to the polls in markets accounting for about 54% of the global population and nearly 60% of global GDP. This will generate regulatory and policy uncertainty in the short and medium term. We may look back on some \u2013 especially the US and EU \u2013 as the most consequential elections in decades, amid competing visions for international relationships and economic policy that will fundamentally impact the global business environment.\nCurrent events muddy the geopolitical outlook and raise the risk of more significant conflict escalation in the year ahead. But what is crystal clear is geopolitics has become a multiverse: a complex mix of alliances and rivalries, with overlapping bilateral, regional and other types of institutional groupings. These dynamics, coupled with more countries heading to the polls in 2024 than in any year in recent history, elevate the likelihood of geopolitical surprises in 2024 \u2013 on both the downside and the upside.\nThe geopolitics surrounding AI and the oceans are just two of the top 10 geopolitical developments in the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook. The EY Geostrategic Business Group selected these developments because they are most likely to have significant impacts on organizations across sectors and geographies in 2024. As executives seek to anticipate and plan for geopolitical disruptions, two key themes will be important to keep in mind in 2024. The first theme is multipolarity, as geopolitical power becomes more dispersed amid heightened competition between blocs or alliance networks. The second is de-risking, with countries\u2019 policy stances seeking to reduce global dependencies, prioritizing national security (broadly defined) over purely economic considerations.\nThe top 10 geopolitical developments in the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook will have broad-based impacts on companies across sectors and geographies. But each development is likely to have more direct impacts on certain sectors and sub-sectors, particularly in the near to medium term.\nMultipolarity and de-risking will pose both challenges and opportunities for companies around the world. Each of the developments explored in the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook will affect companies in unique ways and will therefore necessitate specific geostrategic actions to capitalize on the opportunities they present while also mitigating the risks they pose. At a high level, there are three no-regrets geostrategic moves that companies should take.\nIn this era of profound change in the international system, the importance of geopolitics to corporate strategy is at its highest level in a generation. Successfully weaving geopolitical dynamics into corporate strategy will increasingly be a competitive advantage.\nMany companies\u2019 supply chains are exposed to geopolitical developments. Executives need to determine how they can better position their company\u2019s operating model and supply chain strategy to proactively adjust and increase their resilience to geopolitical disruptions.\nMultipolarity and de-risking are influencing government approaches to policies regarding climate change and natural resources, which will affect companies\u2019 sustainability requirements, costs, competitive opportunities and strategy. Executives should incorporate new policies and regulations, as well as signals for how such policies may evolve in the future, into their sustainability strategies.\nGlobal executives seeking to anticipate and plan for geopolitical disruptions should keep two key themes of multipolarity and de-risking in mind in 2024. There are three pivotal steps to take to get ahead of the top developments coming in the next year.\n2024 Geostrategic Outlook webcast\nJoin the webcast on 23 January: top 10 geopolitical developments for 2024 and the associated business opportunities and challenges.\nAbout this article\nAuthors\nEY Global Geostrategic Business Group Insights Leader; EY Global Research Institute Director \u2013 EY Knowledge\nEY Global SaT Markets, Sustainability and Geostrategy Leader\nEY EMEIA Leader, Geostrategic Business Group\nRelated articles\nPrepare now for the new era of selective globalization\nExploring scenarios for the world in five years reveals divergent paths for geopolitics, economic policies and company strategies.

Before digging into the\u00a02024 Geostrategic Outlook (pdf), let\u2019s first look back at the past year. How closely did the expectations in the\u00a02023 Geostrategic Outlook\u00a0align with reality?\nRead more Read less\n\n\nAbout the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook\nThe annual Geostrategic Outlook presents analysis by the EY Geostrategic Business Group (GBG) on the global political risk environment in the year ahead.\nTo select the top 10 geopolitical developments in the 2024 Geostrategic Outlook, the GBG first conducted a crowdsourced horizon scanning exercise to identify potential political risks. The crowdsourced inputs came from dozens of subject matter resources across EY teams, including those focused on public policy, strategy, macro trends and sector-level developments across all geographical regions. This scan encompassed the four categories of political risk in the geostrategy framework \u2014 geopolitical, country, regulatory and societal \u2014 throughout all regions of the world. The GBG then identified additional developments through interviews with subject matter resources in other political risk organizations.\nNext, the GBG assessed all the identified political risks along two dimensions: their probability of occurring and the degree to which they would have impact on companies across sectors and geographies globally. This impact assessment is aligned with the second step in implementing a geostrategy. The top 10 geopolitical developments included in this Outlook are those that were assessed to be both high probability and high impact, broadly speaking for global companies.\nRead more Read less\n\n\nThe past year was yet another in which businesses faced an extraordinary collection of geopolitical events and deepening trends. Many geopolitical developments unfolded largely as we expected. \u201cStabilized volatility\u201d \u2013 one of the overarching themes we identified in our 2023 Geostrategic Outlook \u2013 proved an apt description of geopolitical tensions and government intervention in economies persisting and plateauing at an elevated level. However, geopolitical tensions began to rise again in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Middle East \u2013 a region that we had not included in our top 10 developments for 2023.\nOur second overarching theme from 2023 also stood the test of time: governments around the world faced a variety of \u201cpolicy trade-offs.\u201d Among the most consequential and dynamic policy areas has been energy security and associated sustainability concerns. Climate policy continues to reign near the top of the agenda for many governments, culminating in the recent 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in the UAE. However, central banks and fiscal policymakers managed the inflation-recession paradox better than had been expected. And we did not foresee how rapidly generative artificial intelligence (AI) would emerge, so it was a surprise that regulation of AI jumped to the top of the agenda.\nLooking ahead, many of the themes and developments from 2023 will continue to play out in 2024.\nRead more Read less\nDownload the full 2024 Geostrategic Outlook\nPDF (3 MB)\nNavigating a multipolar world\nOne defining feature of the geopolitical environment in 2024 will be multipolarity. A greater number of powerful actors will shape an increasingly complex global system. As great powers, the EU, the US and China will continue to shape the global operating environment in profound ways. Geopolitical swing states \u2013 countries such as India, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil that are not specifically aligned with any major power or bloc \u2013 will gain more sway over the international agenda.\nRead more Read less"

      "ERCOT MONTHLY Issued April 2024 2024 2 ERCOT Monthly March 2024 Look Back GRID OVERVIEW March Peak Demand Set on March 5, the March peak demand of 55,298* MW is 2,204 MW more than the 2023 March peak demand of 53,094 MW set March 31, 2023. *Based on the maximum net system hourly value from the 2024 March Demand and Energy report. **Based on the minimum net system 15-minute interval value from the 2024 March Demand and Energy report. Data for latest two months is based on preliminary settlements. Recent March Peaks ERCOT peak demand records can be found on our website or by navigating to About Us > Helpful Resources > Peak Demand. \u2022 The March demand record of 60,756 MW occurred March 5, 2019, in the 7-8 a.m. hour. \u2022 March 2023 peak demand: 53,094 MW in the 5-6 p.m. hour on March 31 \u2022 March 2022 peak demand: 56,463MW in the 7-8 a.m. hour on March 12 \u2022 March 2021 peak demand: 45,380 MW in the 5-6 p.m. hour on March 27 \u2022 March 2020 peak demand: 52,833 MW in the 4-5 p.m. hour on March 26 \u2022 View ERCOT\u2019s peak demand records. Solar and Wind Records \u2022 ERCOT set two new solar generation records: o 18,881 MW March 28 at 11:24 a.m. with 42.97% penetration at record time o 18,442 MW March 26 at 1:57 p.m. with 42.36% penetration at record time \u2022 A new renewable penetration record of 75.67% was set March 29 at 2:13 p.m. Renewable generation at record penetration time was 34,958 MW. \u2022 These records and other grid facts can be found on the ERCOT Fact Sheet. ERCOT Monthly 3 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE RECAP On Monday, April 8, a total solar eclipse passed over Texas from the southwest to the northeast. As forecasted, the eclipse impacted solar generation in Texas from approximately 12:10 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. CDT. The eclipse was comparable to ERCOT experiencing a faster-than-normal sunset and sunrise in the middle of the day. Solar generation was reduced, dropping from an instantaneous peak of 13.8 GW at the beginning of the eclipse to a low output of 0.7 GW at 1:36 p.m., and then rising to approximately 13.8 GW by 3:10 p.m. ERCOT committed additional generation, took manual actions to increase ramping capability, and deployed Ancillary Services to maintain reliability. MONTHLY ENERGY GENERATION MIX The monthly energy generation increased by 1.4% year-over-year to 32,201 GWh in March 2024, compared to 31,763 GWh in March 2023. The chart below shows the generation type fueling the grid each month. Data for the last two months is based on preliminary settlements. 4 ERCOT Monthly ANCILLARY SERVICES ERCOT uses Ancillary Services (AS) to balance the next day's supply and demand of electricity on the grid and mitigate Real-Time operational issues. Real-Time AS deployment is viewable on our dashboards. ERCOT procured $27.52 million in Ancillary Services for grid reliability in March 2024. WHOLESALE PRICES Average energy prices for March were relatively low, which is typical during the fall and spring seasons. Low fuel costs, specifically natural gas prices, were also a contributing factor. *Averages are weighted by Real-Time Market Load. ERCOT Monthly 5 TRANSMISSION CONGESTION COSTS Total Real-Time congestion rent increased in March 2024 compared to February 2024 with the highest congestion rent in the South and West Zones. *Averages are weighted by Real-Time Market Load. **Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is the Real-Time market evaluation of offers to produce a least-cost dispatch of online resources. SCED calculates Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) using a two-step methodology that applies mitigation to resolve non-competitive constraints. More information is on our website. GENERATION INTERCONNECTION QUEUE BY FUEL TYPE As of March 31, ERCOT was tracking 1,775 active generation interconnection requests totaling 346 GW. This includes 155 GW of solar, 35 GW of wind, 141 GW of battery, and 15 GW of gas projects. *The dates shown are based on developers\u2019 expected commercial delivery dates, and traditionally, we have only seen ~60% make their date. * 6 ERCOT Monthly ERCOT LARGE LOAD INTEGRATION OVERVIEW The amount of Large Load connected to the ERCOT grid is projected to continue growing. ERCOT continues to work on rules with the Large Flexible Load Task Force to move forward where there is consensus and mitigate reliability risks on topics where there is not. 4,479 MW of Large Load have been approved to energize in the past two years. Of these, 2,844 MW are believed to be operational, and the remaining 1,635 MW may energize at any time without additional approval. Project Status 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 No studies submitted - - 1,750 1,750 1,750 8,245 Under ERCOT review - - 5,724 10,762 14,162 18,362 Planning studies approved - - 6,511 8,437 8,883 9,773 Approved to energize 2,523 4,479 4,479 4,479 4,479 4,479 Total in MW 2,523 4,479 18,464 25,428 29,274 40,858 RELIABILITY UNIT COMMITMENT Reliability Unit Commitment (RUC) activity for March included 10 Resources committed due to capacity or congestion. \u201cEffective Resource-Hours\u201d excludes any period during a Reliability Unit Commitment hour when the RUC-committed Resource was starting up, shutting down, off-line, or otherwise not available for dispatch by SCED. ERCOT Monthly 7 AANS, OCNS, AND ERCOT SHOULDER MONTHS In the previous issue (ERCOT-Monthly-March-2024.pdf page 6), we explained how the spring months (March, April, and May) are our shoulder months, when we work with generator and transmission owners to schedule maintenance outages for their equipment ahead of summer. This means on a given day during the spring, fewer operating reserves may be available while equipment is down for maintenance work. We issue notices daily, which are one way we communicate with our generator and transmission owners (also referred to as Market Participants (MPs)). It\u2019s important to note that these notices are directed to and intended for the generators and transmission owners and are posted for transparency into grid operations. As ERCOT manages supply and demand on the grid, we might issue an Advance Action Notice (AAN), which is a tool we use to aid us in reliably managing the grid. The AAN is an operational notice used as a heads-up to MPs that ERCOT needs to adjust or delay some scheduled maintenance outages for a specific period of time due to a change in forecasted conditions. The reasons can include hotter temperatures, high number of scheduled and/or forced outages, and low renewable generation \u2013 or a combination of these. The request to adjust or delay a maintenance outage often leads to a positive market response, which provides the additional capacity ERCOT was looking to obtain. We then work to reschedule any delayed maintenance so the operators can be ready for the upcoming peak demand season. For context, two AANs have been issued this spring (as of April 30), while last spring at this same time, three had been issued (see box at left). ERCOT might also issue an Operating Condition Notice (OCN) as a heads-up to MPs that certain protocol criteria have been met (for example from last May: Temperatures have met our criteria of 94 degrees or higher in the months of October-May between San Antonio and the Dallas Fort Worth region). The MPs then take any actions they may need to be best prepared for these hotter temperatures. Stay Informed If tighter grid conditions with higher demand periods were expected, ERCOT would issue a notification to the public and media through TXANS, post on social media, and distribute a news release. Another way to stay informed on current and extended grid conditions is to view our Grid and Market Conditions (ercot.com) dashboards. Two easy-to-view dashboards are Supply and Demand (left graph), which shows a current view and a 6-day look ahead, and the Grid Conditions (right graph), which shows Real-Time operating reserves. AANs Issued with the requested MW: Spring 2024 \uf0b7 Issued April 12 (4,867 MW) \uf0b7 Issued April 26 (2,832 MW) Spring 2023 \uf0b7 Issued March 16 (3,071 MW) \uf0b7 Issued March 29 (7,808 MW) \uf0b7 Issued April 20 (1,720 MW) \uf0b7 Issued May 3 (2,900 MW) \uf0b7 Issued May 4 (3,380 MW) \uf0b7 Issued May 11 (4,500 MW) \uf0b7 Issued May 16 (3,000 MW) 8 ERCOT Monthly May Look Forward May Monthly Outlook for Resource Adequacy (MORA) Scenarios Under typical grid conditions, the deterministic scenario indicates that there should be sufficient generating capacity available to serve the expected peak load. Scenario modeling results indicate a low risk, less than 1%, of ERCOT having to declare an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA). For the typical peak load day in May, the highest risk hours extend from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. when daily loads are typically near their highest levels and solar production is ramping down. The highest risk hour is Hour Ending 9 p.m. The ratio of available dispatchable to available total capacity for the peak load hour (9 p.m.) is 79%. This latter measure helps indicate the extent that the grid relies on dispatchable resources to meet the peak load. The possibility of low wind production remains a significant risk for maintaining adequate reserves for the May peak demand day. Probabilistic and deterministic scenarios that reflect an historically low May wind generation day (based on weather going back to 1980) indicate an increased reserve shortage risk during the early evening hours. (Please note, the MORA probabilistic assessment is not intended to forecast expected grid conditions.) MORA reports can be found on ERCOT\u2019s Resource Adequacy page. Links to the May MORA: MORA_May2024.pdf (ercot.com) MORA_May2024.xlsx (live.com) ERCOT Monthly 9 Additional Items of Note May CDR ERCOT publishes a Capacity, Demand, and Reserves (CDR) report twice a year to provide forecasted Planning Reserve Margins for the ERCOT summer and winter Peak Load Seasons (June - September and December - February, respectively). The Planning Reserve Margin represents the percentage of resource capacity in excess of firm electricity demand available to cover uncertainty in future demand, generator availability, and new resource supply. In May, ERCOT will release the Summer 2025 CDR, which will include ERCOT Protocol required summaries for future years; however, it will also contain a supplemental tab with the numbers stemming from the incorporation of House Bill (HB) 5066 (88th Legislative Session) requiring ERCOT to include prospective load identified by Transmission Service Providers. This has led to significant increases in large loads (i.e., crypto mining, hydrogen and hydrogen-related manufacturing, data centers, and electrification). Legislative Update The Texas Senate has released the 2024 Interim Legislative Charges with many related to the electric industry and the ERCOT market. ERCOT looks forward to participating in the Interim Charge process to ensure we maintain an efficient and reliable electric market. Relevant electric industry-related Interim Charges include: \u2022 Electricity Market Design: Assess state efforts to provide incentives for new thermal generation. Review and report on the state of the electricity market in Texas and issues impacting the reliability and resiliency of the Texas electric grid. Consider rulemaking related to wholesale market design, including the impact of these changes on grid reliability, market revenues, costs to consumers, and the efficiency of operations. Examine and report on the direct and indirect impacts that variable resources, such as wind and solar, have on grid resiliency, consumer prices, and market uncertainty. Monitor the implementation of House Bill 1500, 88th Legislature. \u2022 Texas Energy Fund: Review and report on the impact of Senate Bill 2627, Powering Texas Forward Act, as passed by the 88th Legislature, which established the Texas Energy Fund (TEF) to provide grants and loans to finance the construction, maintenance, modernization, and operation of electric facilities in Texas. \u2022 Innovative Power Generation: Explore emerging technologies with the potential to add new dispatchable power to our electric grid, including, but not limited to, small modular nuclear reactors, advanced batteries, and new developments in hydrogen and geothermal resources. Identify and recommend regulatory and policy actions required to deploy emerging technologies within the state's electric grid. \u2022 Transmitting Texas Power: Identify the future electric transmission and distribution system needs of the state and recommend ways to reduce barriers to constructing the necessary electric infrastructure to support the growing demand and changes in technology. Review and make any necessary recommendations to enhance legislation 10 ERCOT Monthly passed during the 88th Legislative Session, including the status of projects to improve the safety and resiliency of the transmission system, as well as the effect of current and future projects on consumer costs. \u2022 Managing Texas-sized Growth: Evaluate the state's ability to keep pace with increasing electricity demand related to population growth and energy intensive technologies, such as electric vehicles and data centers. Recommend ways to increase reliability via demand-side response programs. Study ERCOT's forecasting methodology and recommend ways to increase transparency. Monitor ongoing efforts at the Public Utility Commission related to energy efficiency programs and distributed energy resources, including the implementation of Senate Bill 1699 (88th Legislature). \u2022 Impact of Bitcoin Mining on the Texas Electric Grid: Study the impact of energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining facilities on the Texas electric grid. Report on whether any changes should be made to ERCOT demand response programs and Large Flexible Load registration requirements to limit the impact of these facilities on system reliability and consumer costs. \u2022 Artificial Intelligence: Examine the development and utilization of artificial intelligence (AI). Evaluate the implications of AI adoption across the public and private sectors. Make recommendations for a responsible regulatory framework for AI development, including data privacy, industry standards, consumer protections, risk mitigation, and compliance processes. ERCOT also continues to implement the various legislative provisions from previous legislative sessions. A full listing of the of legislative provisions currently undergoing the implementation process can be found in the ERCOT Legislative Status Report. Highlights from the April 23 Board of Directors Meeting \u2022 At the April Board of Directors meeting, ERCOT President and CEO Pablo Vegas unveiled a \u201cNew Era of Planning\u201d strategic initiative to help ensure that all areas of system planning \u2013 from generation and load interconnections, to transmission development \u2013 can adapt to better serve the needs of the rapidly growing Texas economy. The presentation detailed the challenges and opportunities ahead for the ERCOT region, which is forecasted to experience tremendous electric demand growth in the next 5-7 years at a time when the generation resource mix continues to diversify. In addition to utilizing the tools from the last two Texas legislative sessions, ERCOT is focused on changing transmission planning processes to adapt to the changing grid and exploring new opportunities to stay ahead of the growth curve. You can watch the CEO Board Update in the ERCOT archived videos. \u2022 The Board\u2019s Reliability and Markets Committee discussed results of ERCOT\u2019s reliability analysis for three natural-gas fired units owned by CPS Energy that gave notice to indefinitely suspend operations on March 31, 2025. ERCOT\u2019s analysis identified performance deficiencies for which the three Braunig units have a material impact and determined that they are needed to support system reliability. Due to the results of the reliability analysis, ERCOT will issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for Must-Run Alternatives (MRAs). The purpose of the RFP is to solicit more cost-effective alternatives rather than entering into a Reliability Must-Run (RMR) agreement for the impacted resources. The ERCOT Board will approve any potential agreement. In addressing the ERCOT Monthly 11 need to support ERCOT System reliability, any decision on whether or not to enter into an RMR or MRA service agreement must evaluate the costs and benefits of the service. Additional information regarding the RMR process is available here. \u2022 The ERCOT Board voted to approve the San Antonio South Reliability II Regional Planning Group (RPG) Project, a $435 million, Tier 1 project with expected in-service dates from 2028 to 2029. The Board designated the project as critical to the reliability of the ERCOT System pursuant to Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) Substantive Rule \u00a7 25.101(b)(3)(D). The project will support ERCOT reliability requirements through improvements to 45.8-miles of 345-kV and 13.4 miles of 138-kV transmission lines intended to address thermal overloads in the San Antonio area, located in Guadalupe, Wilson, and Atascosa Counties in the South and South-Central weather zones. The San Antonio South Reliability II Project will require PUCT approval of a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) before construction can commence. The critical designation will allow the PUCT to consider the project on an expedited basis. \u2022 The Board of Directors approved two revisions to the ERCOT Nodal Protocols along with a revision to the Retail Market Guide. These revisions are now pending final approval at the PUCT for consideration at the June 13, 2024, Open Meeting. Information regarding recently approved rules and the revision request process is available on the Market Rules section of the ERCOT website. o The Board also considered NOGRR245, Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) Ride-Through Requirements, ultimately moving to send the matter back to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for further consideration. ERCOT will continue to work with stakeholders on the reliability initiative to develop voltage and frequency ride-through requirements for IBRs and Wind-powered Generation Resources consistent with new Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Interconnection and Interoperability Standards. NOGRR245 is expected to be back in front of the ERCOT Board at the June 18 meeting. o The Board\u2019s Reliability and Markets Committee received an update regarding ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) performance and potential changes to the Ancillary Service. (Please see the following section for more on ECRS). \u2022 The Board of Directors accepted the ERCOT audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ending December 31, 2023 and 2022. ERCOT Bylaws provide that \u201c[a]t least annually, an audit of the financial statements of ERCOT shall be performed by the Auditor approved by the Board.\u201d Baker Tilly performed the audit along with an assessment of internal controls, recommendations, and other business items raised by the Board\u2019s Finance and Audit Committee. 12 ERCOT Monthly ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service Update During review of the Ancillary Services (AS) Methodology for 2024, ERCOT committed to revisit ERCOT Contingency Reserve Service (ECRS) prior to summer, based on feedback from the Independent Market Monitor (IMM). Actions taken to date include: \u2022 Reduced quantity during review of AS for 2024 \u2022 Will discuss quantity criteria later in the year as part of other AS efforts \u2022 Current focus for this summer is whether or not to release ECRS earlier on tight days ERCOT has worked with the IMM to develop potential mechanisms to release ECRS earlier during near-scarcity conditions, while still meeting system reliability requirements. One option is a continuous release of the portion of ECRS not used for frequency recovery behind an offer floor; however, this option requires Protocol and system changes by ERCOT and Market Participants, and, therefore, will not be implemented before this summer. The quicker option is to release blocks of ECRS automatically when SCED is short of capacity by a given amount. ERCOT proposed NPRR 1224 to formalize the mechanism to be used to release ECRS when SCED is short. We worked with the IMM to propose a trigger level at which this release would occur to start the stakeholder discussion. We expect the ultimate trigger will be determined through the NPRR approval process, which would balance the impacts of this change on various stakeholders. The Protocol Revision Subcommittee tabled NPRR 1224 at its April meeting, making a decision on NPRR 1224 unlikely before summer. Without this guidance on an appropriately-balanced trigger, ERCOT intends to release ECRS in a similar manner to last year until such guidance is received. ERCOT will, in parallel, be filing a separate NPRR to implement the \u201coffer floor\u201d option so that it can be considered. New EPA Rules Impacting Power Plant Operations Announced On April 25, the EPA finalized four new rules impacting power plant operations. These rules include the following: \u2022 Greenhouse Gas Rule. Substantially limits emissions of carbon dioxide from existing coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants at levels determined based on operations using carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). \u2022 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) Rule. Substantially restricts emissions of mercury and other substances at coal-fired power plants. \u2022 Effluent Limitation Guidelines. Establishes discharge standards for various wastewater pollutants at coal-fired power plants. \u2022 Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule. Broadens the scope of existing coal ash impoundment restrictions to include additional sites that were previously unregulated at the federal level. ERCOT is currently evaluating the potential impacts of these rules. ERCOT Monthly 13 Consideration of Mitigation Solutions for South Texas Export Generic Transmission Constraints ERCOT is working to identify solutions to mitigate the need for possible firm load-shedding if flows on certain lines transporting power from South Texas to the San Antonio area exceed certain limits. ERCOT has determined that flows exceeding these limits can, under certain operating conditions, place the reliability of the entire grid at risk. ERCOT established the South Texas Export Generic Transmission Constraints (GTC) to enable ERCOT\u2019s tools to ensure these flow limits are factored into generator dispatch. However, during high system demand and a deficiency of generation north of the GTC, flows on these lines could still exceed the limits. In those cases, ERCOT would be required to take all actions necessary to mitigate any overload of the South Texas Export GTC, including directing firm load-shedding if necessary. ERCOT has already implemented operating procedures to help reduce the need for load-shedding under these conditions. For example, when loading approaches 90% of the limit, ERCOT will activate a series of pre-arranged transmission switching actions that will reduce the loading on the impacted transmission lines. However, ERCOT is also investigating other additional measures that may help mitigate load-shedding risk by remedying the generation deficiency north of the GTC. ERCOT is currently developing a request for proposal (RFP) seeking the participation of demand response or generation capacity sources in certain high-impact locations. If the PUCT approves this proposal and valid offers are submitted and awarded, this solution could be in place as soon as early July. ERCOT is also investigating changes to certain price parameters in its dispatch algorithm that could allow for more optimal management of congestion on these lines, reducing the likelihood of load-shedding. We have also initiated discussions with Transmission Service Providers (TSPs) regarding new technologies that may improve dynamic ratings of transmission lines, which may allow for greater transfer capability under certain weather conditions. 14 ERCOT Monthly Upcoming Activities BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS* ERCOT Board of Directors meetings are livestreamed on ercot.com, where you can also find links, additional information, agendas, and supporting documents.

The natural resources, fuels and essential products produced here cement America\u2019s energy security, fortify Texas\u2019 economic strength and advance global stability at a time when our energy leadership has never been more crucial,\u201d he said.\n$26.3 billion in state and local tax revenue and royalties from the Texas oil and natural gas industry translates to an extraordinary $72 million every day that pays for Texas\u2019 public schools, universities, roads, first responders and other essential services. Several sources of tax revenue from oil and natural gas surged in FY 23 including state and local sales taxes paid by the industry, which rose by $1.6 billion, an indicator of the industry\u2019s ongoing investment in Texas. Property taxes paid by the oil and natural gas industry rose another $1.8 billion, as property values of oil and natural gas-bearing mineral properties more than doubled in a single year.\nIn 2023, 99 percent of the state\u2019s oil and natural gas royalties were deposited into the Permanent School Fund and the Permanent University Fund, which support Texas public education. Each fund received $1.8 billion. Out of FY 2023\u2019s production taxes paid, the Economic Stabilization (\u201cRainy Day\u201d) Fund, or ESF, and the State Highway Fund (SHF) each received $3.3 billion. Since its inception in 1987, the Rainy Day Fund has received over $31.2 billion from oil and natural gas production taxes. All of these are funded almost exclusively with taxes and state royalties paid by the oil and natural gas industry.\nIn FY 2023, Texas school districts received $2.81 billion in property taxes from mineral properties producing oil and natural gas, pipelines, and gas utilities. Counties received an additional $885.6 million in these property taxes.\nPecos-Barstow-Toyah ISD in West Texas ranked #1 receiving $275.2 million in these property taxes. Reeves County ranked #1 with $98.9 million paid in oil and natural gas property taxes \u2013 more than double its total from fiscal year 2022.\nSince 2007, when TXOGA first started compiling this data, the Texas oil and natural gas industry has paid more than $230.3 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties, a figure that does not include the hundreds of billions of dollars in payroll for some of the highest paying jobs in the state, taxes paid on office buildings and personal property, and the enormous economic ripple effect that benefits other sectors of the economy.\nIn 2023, the industry employed more than 480,000 Texans who earned an average of $124,000 a year \u2013 nearly twice the average paid by the rest of Texas\u2019 private sector. Conservative estimates indicate that each of these jobs generates approximately two more jobs, with more than 1.4 million total jobs supported across the Texas economy. Some economists say this number could be as high as three more jobs supported and total over 2 million jobs in Texas.\n\u201cThis type of unmatched, repeat economic performance does not happen by accident,\u201d said Staples. \u201cSuccess is the result of non-stop industry innovation, investment and operational efficiencies that shattered a string of oil and natural gas production, supply, refining and export records last year \u2013 all while achieving world-leading environmental progress.\u201d\nTexas hit production records in six of 12 months in 2023, producing as much as 5.6 million barrels per day of crude oil in October 2023 \u2013 more than 42% of the nation\u2019s total and the highest monthly oil production total ever.\nNew record-highs in natural gas marketed production occurred in seven of 12 months in 2023, and in October eclipsed 1.0 trillion cubic feet in a single month for the first time ever, accounting for nearly 30% of the nation\u2019s production.\nTexas refineries set two new processing records in 2023: Texas refineries processed a record 5.6 million barrels of crude oil per day in July 2023.\u00a0 And as Texas produced and exported record amounts of natural gas liquids (NGLs) in 2023, refineries also utilized record amounts of NGLs.\nStaples noted the United States is not only the world\u2019s number one producer of oil and natural gas \u2013 with Texas at the front \u2013 but the nation also leads the world in emissions reductions. \u201cNo one produces, transports, and refines oil and natural gas with the same commitment to safety and protecting the environment as American producers. Industry-led initiatives like the Texas Methane & Flaring Coalition and The Environmental Partnership are dramatically reducing emissions and achieving environmental gains unseen anywhere else in the world.\u201d\nIn addition to its economic impact for Texas, Staples described the Texas oil and natural gas industry\u2019s contribution to global stability: \u201cWith so much uncertainty in the world, the need for reliable, responsibly produced energy from a stable trading partner has never been more crucial. Texas is that trade partner. Our producers, pipelines, refineries, and exporters answer the call to alleviate the global energy crisis, made worse by war.\u201d\u00a0\nStaples noted Texas\u2019 liquified natural gas (LNG) exports to Europe \u2013 6.8 billion cubic feet per day in FY23 \u2013 more than doubled from 2.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcf/d) in 2021 \u2013 and subsequently reached a record-high 8.1 bcf/d in October 2023. \u201cAs a result, our allies are less dependent on hostile nations and their people benefit from the safety, security and opportunity made possible by reliable energy from Texas,\u201d he said.\nStaples asserted, \u201cGrowth like we\u2019ve seen in Texas is not only unprecedented, it is not guaranteed. We cannot take for granted that this industry can continue to rewrite its record book in the face of federal policies blatantly designed to undermine progress.\u00a0 Delayed permits, canceled pipeline projects, closed and delayed federal leasing programs and incoherent regulations hurt American consumers and stifle our ability to deliver energy freedom and security around the world.\u00a0\n\u201cAt the state level, even as the #1 oil and natural gas state in the world\u2019s leading energy nation, Texas has some challenges to address if we want to maintain position as a global energy leader.\u201d Staples described Permian Basin producers\u2019 need for infrastructure and more power generation as they electrify their operations. \u201cNo other major industry has to rely on temporary sources of electricity, like portable generators, for their electricity needs and neither some of the most prolific oil producers in the world,\u201d he said.\n\u201cA growing Texas needs more pipelines and a cost-effective electrical power generation market that puts consumers\u2019 needs first and incentivizes dispatchable power,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must prioritize transparency and accountability as the foundation of our electrical grid to continue attracting jobs and investment here.\u201d\nStaples continued, \u201cWe need policy that allows Texas to lead the emerging carbon capture and storage industry (CCS). Manufacturers and companies of all varieties, including Texas oil and natural gas producers, pipeline, and refiners, are working to lower their emissions profile to meet customer demands. Texas must demonstrate a commitment to advance CCS because it benefits landowners and enables Texas businesses to remain competitive.\u201d\nStaples concluded, \u201cWe know that policy can promote prosperity or hinder it. We look forward to working with our lawmakers to ensure that the American energy leadership that starts in Texas, stays in Texas.\u201d\nStay Updated\nGet quick updates in our e\u2011newsletter.\nRelated Updates\nNovember 15, 2024\nTXOGA Lone Star Energy Forum Features 66th U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Governor Greg Abbott\nTHE WOODLANDS \u2013 The Texas Oil & Gas Association\u2019s (TXOGA) Lone Star Energy Forum in The Woodlands showcased innovation and the state, national and global leadership of the Texas oil and natural gas industry.\nNovember 11, 2024\nEpisode 17: Election Recap\nIn this episode, TXOGA President Todd Staples and Shana Joyce, Vice President of Government and Regulatory Affairs, are joined by U.S. Oil & Gas Association...\nNovember 1, 2024\nOctober: TXOGA Month in Review\nCheck out our Month in Review for September below to see how TXOGA was busy advocating for the Texas oil and natural gas industry\nOctober 18, 2024\nTexas Oil and Natural Gas Upstream Jobs Grew  by 800 in September\nAUSTIN \u2013 Newly-released data from the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC) indicates that upstream oil and natural gas employment rose by an additional 1,700 jobs in September.

The less volatile three-month on three-month comparison showed that production was 1.9% lower in the period from July 2024 to September 2024 than in the previous three months. After revision of the provisional results, production increased by 2.6% in August 2024 compared with July 2024 (provisional figure: +2.9%). Compared with September 2023, production was 4.6% lower in September 2024 after adjustment for calendar effects.\n\n  Loading...\nSignificant drop in production in the automotive industry\nMany branches of industry showed a negative development of production. In September 2024, the seasonally and calendar adjusted production in the automotive industry, for example, declined by 7.8% compared with the previous month, following an increase of 15.4% in August 2024. The significant fluctuations observed in the automotive industry had a serious impact on the overall development of production in the past months. The production decline registered in the chemical industry (-4.3%) also weighed on overall performance in September 2024. By contrast, production in the manufacture of machinery and equipment (+1.7%) showed a positive development.\nIn September 2024, production in industry excluding energy and construction was down 2.7% from August 2024 after seasonal and calendar adjustment. Within industry, decreases were reported in all three major groups. The production of capital goods declined by 4.0%, the production of intermediate goods fell by 1.6% and the production of consumer goods was down 1.4%. Outside industry, energy production in September 2024 was down 2.1% and production in construction dropped by 1.4% compared with the previous month.\nCompared with September 2023, production in industry excluding energy and construction in September 2024 was down 5.2% after calendar adjustment.\nProduction down in energy-intensive industrial branches\nProduction in energy-intensive industrial branches declined by 3.3% in September 2024 from August 2024, after elimination of seasonal and calendar effects, which is mainly due to a drop in production in the chemical industry. A three-month on three-month comparison showed that production in energy-intensive industrial branches was 2.2% lower in the period from July 2024 to September 2024 than in the previous three-month period. Adjusted for calendar effects, production in energy-intensive industrial branches was down 2.0% in September 2024 compared with September 2023. An analysis on the\u00a0Production index for energy-intensive industrial branches (only in German) is available on the \u201cIndustry, manufacturing\u201d page of the Federal Statistical Office\u2019s website.\nMethodological notes:\nThe differing comparative periods must be taken into account in all press releases on short-term indicators. Short-term economic monitoring focuses on comparisons of seasonally and calendar adjusted figures with those of the previous month or quarter. These reflect short-term economic trends. Year-on-year comparisons of calendar adjusted results enable long-term comparisons of levels and are not influenced by seasonal fluctuations or calendar effects. The results of month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year comparisons may differ considerably due to the Covid-19 crisis and the war in Ukraine.\nThe rates of change are based on the production index for industry. The average figure for 2021 is used as the basis of the index and set to 100 index points (2021 = 100). The X13 JDemetra+ method was used for calendar and seasonal adjustment.\nThe five branches referred to here as \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d have particularly high energy demands in relation to their gross value added. In the reference year of 2021, they collectively accounted for 77% of total industrial energy consumption. Their proportion of industrial gross value added stood at 17%. In 2021, just under one million people (929,599) were employed in the 6,986 industrial establishments of these branches in Germany.\nFor better readability, this press release uses a short form for the names of some economic branches which differs from the designations in the \u201cClassification of Economic Activities (2008 edition)\u201d. An overview of these short forms (only in German) is provided on the \u201cIndustry, manufacturing\" page on the website of the Federal Statistical Office.\nMore information:\nBasic data and long time series on the production index in industry can be found in the table Indices of production in manufacturing (42153-0001) in the GENESIS-Online database. It contains the time series of the production index for energy-intensive industrial branches from 2005 onwards.\nA dossier on the \"Short-term indicators\" page of the Federal Statistical Office's website provides an analysis of the relationship between material shortages, new orders, production and prices in industry. Detailed information on production in energy-intensive industrial branches is available on the \"Industry, manufacturing\" page.\nThe production index is also available on Dashboard Germany at www.dashboard-deutschland.de (only in German) In this data portal, the Federal Statistical Office brings together up-to-date indicators from official statistics producers and other data providers on the topics of the economy, finance, the labour market, construction, housing, energy and Ukraine. The portal also contains the Economic Pulse Monitor tool (Pulsmesser f\u00fcr die Wirtschaft) (only in German) for real-time economic monitoring.\nImportant information regarding the GENESIS-Online database:\nAfter leaving the beta phase, our database's new user interface has been available as the main interface version since 5 November 2024. The new interface offers faster data retrieval and intuitive table search and customisation options. There have also been changes to the structure of the machine-readable flat file (CSV) format and the data output format for table downloads. For further details and other important information on the release, please see the info page of the new GENESIS-Online database.\ncontactfor further info\nShort-term indices\nPhone: +49 611 75 2806\n\n\n  Contact Form\nMore on this topic\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Topics\n\nBack to: Home\u00adpage\nSubnavigation of all website sections\nOur topics\nContact\nStatistisches Bundesamt\nGustav-Stresemann-Ring 11\n65189 Wiesbaden\nFollow us!\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9\u00a0\n              \n\n              \n              \n              \n                \n                \n              \n\n              \n              \n              \n              \n                \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n              \n\n              \n\n  \n\n              \u00a0Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis) | 2024\n",

However, the country is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for domestic power production. In 2023, some 25 percent of gross electricity was generated using lignite and hard coal, considered the most polluting of energy sources. Natural gas contributed another 15.5 percent.\nCoal power plant pollution\nCoal plants are the biggest polluters in the European Union. Six out of the 10 most polluting coal-fired power plants in the EU were located in Germany in 2022. Germany's Neurath plant produced some 24 million metric tons of CO\u2082 equivalent that year. Although the government had previously agreed to end its reliance on coal by the year 2030, this fossil fuel made a comeback in 2022 during the global energy crisis.\u00a0\nGermany's move towards renewables\nDespite coal's continued contribution to the power mix, Germany's renewable electricity generation has increased by roughly 70 percent in one decade. Growth within the wind power sector has been especially notable. By 2022, onshore wind farms generated almost 100 terawatt-hours of electricity, while offshore farms produced an additional 25 terawatt-hours.\n\n                        Distribution of energy sources used for gross electricity generation in Germany in 2023\n                    \n\n                                    Additional Information\n                                \n\n                                Show sources information\n                            \n                                Show publisher information\n                            \n                                Use Ask Statista Research Service\n                            \nMarch 2024\nGermany\n2023\nPercentage points exceeding 100 percent are probably due to rounding.\nPercentage points exceeding 100 percent are probably due to rounding.\nOther statistics on the topicNuclear power phase-out in Germany\nEnergy\nPrimary energy consumption in Germany 2019-2023, by fuel\nEnergy\nNuclear power's share of German energy mix in Germany 2000-2023\nEnergy\nGermany's electricity generation from nuclear sources 2005-2023\nEnergy\nEnergy generation outlook in Germany 2040, by source\nTo download this statistic in XLS format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PNG format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PDF format you need a Statista Account\nTo download this statistic in PPT format you need a Statista Account\nAs a Premium user you get access to the detailed source references and background information about this statistic.\nAs a Premium user you get access to background information and details about the release of this statistic.\nAs soon as this statistic is updated, you will immediately be notified via e-mail.\n\u2026 to incorporate the statistic into your presentation at any time.\nYou need at least a Starter Account to use this feature.\n* For commercial use only\n\n                            Basic Account\n                        \n\n                            Starter Account\n                        \n\n                    The statistic on this page is a Premium Statistic and is included in this account.\n\n                            Professional Account\n                        \n1\n                        All prices do not include sales tax.

      "Page 1 of 8 Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner This report summarizes key respiratory virus surveillance indicators. The indicators are compiled from laboratory-based data as well emergency department visit data. This report is meant to provide more context for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as co-circulation of respiratory viruses increases. More detailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are preliminary and may change as additional reports are received. Weekly Surveillance Key Points During the summer, an abbreviated report will be published with the full report to resume in the fall. A summary describing the 2023-2024 influenza season in Chicago is at the end of this report. COVID-19: \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses is <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has decreased from 3.8% to 2.5%. Influenza: \u2022 The risk of influenza infection remains low; the percent of specimens testing positive for influenza is <1%. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI are below local thresholds. \u2022 For situational awareness of the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza see, H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary. Other Respiratory Viruses: \u2022 The percent of emergency department visits in children <5 years old due to RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for parainfluenza has decreased from 4.6% to 2.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for rhinovirus/enterovirus has decreased from 17.3% to 12.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for adenovirus has decreased from 2.9% to <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for human metapneumovirus remains at 4.6%. Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Current Week and Cumulative The table below includes respiratory viral PCR tests performed by several hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Chicago Respiratory Virus Weekly Surveillance Report Surveillance Week 21 (May 19, 2024 - May 25, 2024) Week Ending May 25, 2024 Since October 1, 2023 Respiratory Pathogen # Tested % Positive # Tested % Positive Influenza* 2,452 0.9 173,748 6.4 RSV* 1,319 0.7 115,868 4.8 SARS-CoV-2* 1,162 2.8 127,280 6.8 Parainfluenza 1,469 2.9 62,806 1.8 Rhinovirus/Enterovirus 567 12.9 35,767 13.1 Adenovirus 567 0.9 35,755 3.4 Human Metapneumovirus 569 4.6 35,996 2.7 Seasonal Coronaviruses\u2020 1,467 0.5 62,588 2.0 *Represents both dualplex and multiplex PCR data. All other data represents only multiplex panels that include the specified pathogens;\u2020 Four seasonal coronavirus strains include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Page 2 of 8 Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Seasonal Trends These graphs show seasonal trends of selected respiratory virus testing data presented in the previous table. Typical seasonal periods when activity tends to increase for influenza and RSV are indicated by shaded areas. Elevated test positivity outside of typical seasonal periods suggests atypical activity, and increased clinician awareness and testing may be warranted. Yearly data can also be used to compare the timing and intensity of viral activity, although changes in testing patterns also influence yearly trends, and data should be interpreted in the context of other surveillance indicators. Emergency Department Illness Surveillance In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals report emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). By tracking symptoms (or chief complaints) of patients in emergency departments, public health can promptly detect unusual levels of illness to determine whether a response is warranted. A map of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity levels by patient zip code determined by the emergency department chief complaint data can be found on the influenza dashboard. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to influenza-like illness (ILI) for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Page 3 of 8 Percent of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Percent of emergency department visits attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnoses for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Seasonal trends are displayed for children younger than 5 years old who are most impacted by RSV. Weekly Pediatric Admissions Emergency department visit data includes information on whether the visit resulted in a hospital admission at any time during the course of the clinical encounter. The syndromes or disease associated with the hospitalization are based on chief complaint and discharge diagnosis codes and no not necessarily represent lab-confirmed cases. The chart below represents hospital admissions among children <18 years-old at Chicago hospitals due to acute respiratory illnesses. Page 4 of 8 National and State Respiratory Virus Surveillance The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s FluView report provides national updates and trends relat-ed to influenza activity across the United States, and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) is a voluntary laboratory-based system that monitors temporal and geographic circulation patterns of several respiratory viruses in the U.S. The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Hospitalization Sur-veillance Network (RSV-NET) is a CDC population-based surveillance system that collects data on severe RSV hospitalizations, including those resulting in ICU admission or death, among children and adults. The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three platforms that conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) among children and adults. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. The Illinois and Suburban Cook County influ-enza surveillance reports are also available online. Current and archived issues of the Chicago Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report can be found on the CDPH website section Current Flu Situation in Chi-cago. Page 5 of 8 This report summarizes key influenza surveillance indicators for the 2023-2024 season. The indicators are compiled from influenza ICU hospitalizations, laboratory-based data as well emergency department and outpatient visits data. More de-tailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are pre-liminary and may change as additional reports are received. Overall, the 2023-2024 season had moderate influenza activity similar to other pre-pandemic seasons and no influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. This season saw two distinct peaks of activity with the second peak associated mainly with influenza B. Influenza-Associated ICU Hospitalizations - In Illinois, influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations are reportable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the weekly number of reported ICU hospitalizations for Chi-cago residents. There were 298 influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations reported during the 2023-2024 season. Excluding the two pan-demic seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22), this is higher than last season and the fourth highest number of ICU hospitaliza-tions reported in the last nine seasons. The peak number of reported hospitalizations (34) occurred in December with less than half (43%) of cases reported by December 30, 2023 compared to last season where over 90% were reported by the end of December. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, the overall cumulative rate of influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations landed in the middle of the previous nine influenza seasons; the cumulative rate was lower than three seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20) and higher than three seasons (2015-16, 2016-17, 2022-23). Rates began to increase in late December and continued to increase until mid-March and leveling off by April 2024. Chicago 2023-2024 Influenza Season Surveillance Summary Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner Page 6 of 8 For the 2023-2024 season, the highest cumulative ICU hospitalization rates were among those 50-64 and 65+ years of age. Among pediatric cases, those 0-4 years had higher rates than school-aged children 5-17 years. The lowest rates were among those 18-49 years. This is consistent with national trends of cumulative rates of influenza hospitalization. Influenza Virus Laboratory Surveillance The chart below includes data on influenza viral PCR tests performed by sev-eral hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Overall influenza laboratory percent positivity was 6.5% for the season peaking at 14.5% at the end of December 2023. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, this is the lowest overall percent positivity during the past nine seasons; however the number of influenza tests performed and reported was higher than any prior season. For the 2023-2024 season, 72% of positive specimens were influenza A with the majority not subtyped. Among those subtyped, 61% were A(H1N1)pdm09. Since early March, influenza B accounted for the majority of positive specimens. Page 7 of 8 Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance Two data sources are utilized to conduct syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness, emergency department visit data and outpatient visit data (ILINet). In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals re-port emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). For ILINet, sever-al outpatient clinics throughout Chicago report on a weekly basis the total number of outpatient clinic visits, and of those visits, the number with ILI. The graphs below show the percent of emergency department and outpatient visits attributed to ILI by week for the 2015-2016 - 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 2.2% for the season. This is con-sistent with the previous eight-season average of 2.4%. The peak (4.1%) occurred in December with 47% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. \u2022 The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI was 1.3% for the season. This is lower than the previous eight-season aver-age of 2.7%. The peak (2.5%) occurred in November with 49% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. Influenza Outbreaks in Congregate Settings - In Illinois, outbreaks of influenza or ILI in a congregate setting are re-portable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the number of reported influenza outbreaks in congregate settings in Chicago for the 2013-2014 to 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 There were 15 influenza outbreaks in congregate settings reported this season with a total of 45 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases; this is almost double the number of reported outbreaks from last season. The highest number of reported outbreaks occurred in 2017-2018 with 22 outbreaks reported.",

      "Page 1 of 8 Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner This report summarizes key respiratory virus surveillance indicators. The indicators are compiled from laboratory-based data as well emergency department visit data. This report is meant to provide more context for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as co-circulation of respiratory viruses increases. More detailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are preliminary and may change as additional reports are received. Weekly Surveillance Key Points During the summer, an abbreviated report will be published with the full report to resume in the fall. A summary describing the 2023-2024 influenza season in Chicago is at the end of this report. COVID-19: \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses is <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has decreased from 3.8% to 2.5%. Influenza: \u2022 The risk of influenza infection remains low; the percent of specimens testing positive for influenza is <1%. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI are below local thresholds. \u2022 For situational awareness of the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza see, H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary. Other Respiratory Viruses: \u2022 The percent of emergency department visits in children <5 years old due to RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for parainfluenza has decreased from 4.6% to 2.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for rhinovirus/enterovirus has decreased from 17.3% to 12.9%. \u2022 The test positivity for adenovirus has decreased from 2.9% to <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for human metapneumovirus remains at 4.6%. Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Current Week and Cumulative The table below includes respiratory viral PCR tests performed by several hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Chicago Respiratory Virus Weekly Surveillance Report Surveillance Week 21 (May 19, 2024 - May 25, 2024) Week Ending May 25, 2024 Since October 1, 2023 Respiratory Pathogen # Tested % Positive # Tested % Positive Influenza* 2,452 0.9 173,748 6.4 RSV* 1,319 0.7 115,868 4.8 SARS-CoV-2* 1,162 2.8 127,280 6.8 Parainfluenza 1,469 2.9 62,806 1.8 Rhinovirus/Enterovirus 567 12.9 35,767 13.1 Adenovirus 567 0.9 35,755 3.4 Human Metapneumovirus 569 4.6 35,996 2.7 Seasonal Coronaviruses\u2020 1,467 0.5 62,588 2.0 *Represents both dualplex and multiplex PCR data. All other data represents only multiplex panels that include the specified pathogens;\u2020 Four seasonal coronavirus strains include 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1. Page 2 of 8 Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Seasonal Trends These graphs show seasonal trends of selected respiratory virus testing data presented in the previous table. Typical seasonal periods when activity tends to increase for influenza and RSV are indicated by shaded areas. Elevated test positivity outside of typical seasonal periods suggests atypical activity, and increased clinician awareness and testing may be warranted. Yearly data can also be used to compare the timing and intensity of viral activity, although changes in testing patterns also influence yearly trends, and data should be interpreted in the context of other surveillance indicators. Emergency Department Illness Surveillance In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals report emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). By tracking symptoms (or chief complaints) of patients in emergency departments, public health can promptly detect unusual levels of illness to determine whether a response is warranted. A map of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity levels by patient zip code determined by the emergency department chief complaint data can be found on the influenza dashboard.

Percent of emergency department visits attributed to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnoses for residents of Chicago zip codes based on chief complaint data. Seasonal trends are displayed for children younger than 5 years old who are most impacted by RSV. Weekly Pediatric Admissions Emergency department visit data includes information on whether the visit resulted in a hospital admission at any time during the course of the clinical encounter. The syndromes or disease associated with the hospitalization are based on chief complaint and discharge diagnosis codes and no not necessarily represent lab-confirmed cases. The chart below represents hospital admissions among children <18 years-old at Chicago hospitals due to acute respiratory illnesses. Page 4 of 8 National and State Respiratory Virus Surveillance The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s FluView report provides national updates and trends relat-ed to influenza activity across the United States, and the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) is a voluntary laboratory-based system that monitors temporal and geographic circulation patterns of several respiratory viruses in the U.S. The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Hospitalization Sur-veillance Network (RSV-NET) is a CDC population-based surveillance system that collects data on severe RSV hospitalizations, including those resulting in ICU admission or death, among children and adults. The Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RESP-NET) comprises three platforms that conduct population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed hospitalizations associated with COVID-19, Influenza, and Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) among children and adults. CDC is tracking the COVID-19 pandemic in a weekly publication called COVID Data Tracker Weekly Review. The Illinois and Suburban Cook County influ-enza surveillance reports are also available online. Current and archived issues of the Chicago Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report can be found on the CDPH website section Current Flu Situation in Chi-cago. Page 5 of 8 This report summarizes key influenza surveillance indicators for the 2023-2024 season. The indicators are compiled from influenza ICU hospitalizations, laboratory-based data as well emergency department and outpatient visits data. More de-tailed information on influenza and COVID-19 activity can be found on their respective online dashboards. All data are pre-liminary and may change as additional reports are received. Overall, the 2023-2024 season had moderate influenza activity similar to other pre-pandemic seasons and no influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported. This season saw two distinct peaks of activity with the second peak associated mainly with influenza B. Influenza-Associated ICU Hospitalizations - In Illinois, influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations are reportable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the weekly number of reported ICU hospitalizations for Chi-cago residents. There were 298 influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations reported during the 2023-2024 season. Excluding the two pan-demic seasons (2020-21 and 2021-22), this is higher than last season and the fourth highest number of ICU hospitaliza-tions reported in the last nine seasons. The peak number of reported hospitalizations (34) occurred in December with less than half (43%) of cases reported by December 30, 2023 compared to last season where over 90% were reported by the end of December. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, the overall cumulative rate of influenza-associated ICU hospitalizations landed in the middle of the previous nine influenza seasons; the cumulative rate was lower than three seasons (2017-18 to 2019-20) and higher than three seasons (2015-16, 2016-17, 2022-23). Rates began to increase in late December and continued to increase until mid-March and leveling off by April 2024. Chicago 2023-2024 Influenza Season Surveillance Summary Brandon Johnson, Mayor May 31, 2024 Olusimbo Ige, MD, MS, MPH, Commissioner Page 6 of 8 For the 2023-2024 season, the highest cumulative ICU hospitalization rates were among those 50-64 and 65+ years of age. Among pediatric cases, those 0-4 years had higher rates than school-aged children 5-17 years. The lowest rates were among those 18-49 years. This is consistent with national trends of cumulative rates of influenza hospitalization. Influenza Virus Laboratory Surveillance The chart below includes data on influenza viral PCR tests performed by sev-eral hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents. Overall influenza laboratory percent positivity was 6.5% for the season peaking at 14.5% at the end of December 2023. Excluding the two pandemic seasons, this is the lowest overall percent positivity during the past nine seasons; however the number of influenza tests performed and reported was higher than any prior season. For the 2023-2024 season, 72% of positive specimens were influenza A with the majority not subtyped. Among those subtyped, 61% were A(H1N1)pdm09. Since early March, influenza B accounted for the majority of positive specimens. Page 7 of 8 Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance Two data sources are utilized to conduct syndromic surveillance for influenza-like illness, emergency department visit data and outpatient visit data (ILINet). In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals re-port emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). For ILINet, sever-al outpatient clinics throughout Chicago report on a weekly basis the total number of outpatient clinic visits, and of those visits, the number with ILI. The graphs below show the percent of emergency department and outpatient visits attributed to ILI by week for the 2015-2016 - 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) was 2.2% for the season. This is con-sistent with the previous eight-season average of 2.4%. The peak (4.1%) occurred in December with 47% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. \u2022 The proportion of outpatient visits for ILI was 1.3% for the season. This is lower than the previous eight-season aver-age of 2.7%. The peak (2.5%) occurred in November with 49% of visits due to ILI reported by December 30, 2023; 95% were reported by early May. Influenza Outbreaks in Congregate Settings - In Illinois, outbreaks of influenza or ILI in a congregate setting are re-portable as soon as possible but within 24 hours. The graph below shows the number of reported influenza outbreaks in congregate settings in Chicago for the 2013-2014 to 2023-2024 seasons. \u2022 There were 15 influenza outbreaks in congregate settings reported this season with a total of 45 laboratory-confirmed influenza cases; this is almost double the number of reported outbreaks from last season. The highest number of reported outbreaks occurred in 2017-2018 with 22 outbreaks reported.",

The indicators are compiled from laboratory-based data as well emergency department visit data. More detailed information on influenza can be found on the CDPH flu dashboard. All data are preliminary and may change as additional reports are received. Weekly Surveillance Key Points During the summer, an abbreviated report will be published with the full report to resume in the fall. COVID-19: \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits attributed to COVID-19 diagnoses remains at 1.0%. \u2022 The test positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has increased from 7.6% to 9.8%. Influenza: \u2022 The risk of influenza infection remains low; the percent of specimens testing positive for influenza is <1%. \u2022 The proportion of emergency department visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) and the proportion of outpatient visits for ILI are below local thresholds. \u2022 For situational awareness of the ongoing outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza see, H5N1 Bird Flu: Current Situation Summary. Other Respiratory Viruses: \u2022 The percent of emergency department visits in children <5 years old due to RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for RSV remains at <1%. \u2022 The test positivity for parainfluenza has decreased from 2.3% to 1.5%. \u2022 The test positivity for rhinovirus/enterovirus has decreased from 9.2% to 9.0%. \u2022 The test positivity for adenovirus has increased from <1% to 1.8%. \u2022 The test positivity for human metapneumovirus decreased from 1.1% to 1.0%. Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Current Week and Cumulative The table below includes respiratory viral PCR tests performed by several hospital laboratories in Chicago as well as two commercial laboratories serving Chicago facilities. Reporting facilities represent nearly half of all acute care hospitals in the city. Data reported include Chicago and non-Chicago residents.

Page 2 of 4 Respiratory Virus Laboratory Surveillance - Seasonal Trends These graphs show seasonal trends of selected respiratory virus testing data presented in the previous table. Typical seasonal periods when activity tends to increase for influenza and RSV are indicated by shaded areas. Elevated test positivity outside of typical seasonal periods suggests atypical activity, and increased clinician awareness and testing may be warranted. Yearly data can also be used to compare the timing and intensity of viral activity, although changes in testing patterns also influence yearly trends, and data should be interpreted in the context of other surveillance indicators. Emergency Department Illness Surveillance In Illinois, all 185 acute-care hospitals report emergency department visit data in near-real time to the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). By tracking symptoms (or chief complaints) of patients in emergency departments, public health can promptly detect unusual levels of illness to determine whether a response is warranted.

      "March 2024 National Climate Report\nAdditional Resources\nRankings Maps\nU.S. Percentage Areas\nRelated Materials\nSupplemental Material\nNational Overview\nMarch Highlights\nMarch Temperature\nThe contiguous U.S. average temperature during March was 45.1\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above average, ranking 17th warmest in the 130-year record.\nTemperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S., while below-average temperatures were observed in small pockets of the West and Southwest.\nFor the month of March, Connecticut and Delaware each had their eighth warmest March on record. Nine additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest March on record.\nThe contiguous U.S. average maximum (daytime) temperature during March was 56.6\u00b0F, 3.6\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for daytime temperatures. Maximum temperatures were above average across the majority of the eastern contiguous U.S. and Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Rockies. Near-average temperatures were observed across much of the West and in parts of the Southeast, while below-normal temperatures were observed in parts of West and Southwest. Illinois ranked eighth warmest on record, while eight additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest March for daytime temperatures.\nThe contiguous U.S. average minimum (nighttime) temperature during March was 33.7\u00b0F, 3.7\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking 16th-warmest March on record for overnight temperatures. Minimum temperatures were above average across much of the contiguous U.S. while near- to below-average temperatures spanned portions of the northern Rockies and Plains and the West. Maine ranked second-warmest on record for March, while 13 additional states experienced a top-10 warmest March for nighttime temperatures.\nThe Alaska statewide March temperature was 14.1\u00b0F, 3.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the 100-year period of record for the state. Temperatures were above average across most of the state with near-normal temperatures in parts of the North Slope, Interior, Southwest and parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nBased on NOAA's Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand during March was 45 percent of average and the ninth-lowest value in the 130-year period of record.\nMarch Precipitation\nThe March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 2.85 inches, 0.34 inch above average, ranking in the wettest third of the 130-year record.\nPrecipitation was above average across much of the West, in the Great Lakes and along the Gulf and East coasts and in parts of the northern Plains. Conversely, precipitation was below normal across much of the Ohio Valley, the Plains, and in parts of the Northwest and Florida.\nMaine and Rhode Island each ranked second-wettest March on record, while six additional states had their top-10 wettest March on record.\nAcross the state of Alaska, the average monthly precipitation ranked in the middle third of the historical record. Precipitation was above average in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior, south-central Alaska and in parts of the Panhandle during the month.\nAccording to the April 2 U.S. Drought Monitor, about 18% of the contiguous U.S. was in drought, down about 3.6% from the end of February. Drought conditions expanded or intensified in portions of the Plains and in parts of the Northwest, central Mississippi Valley, northern Great Lakes and Hawaii this month. Drought contracted or was reduced in intensity across much of the Mississippi Valley, Puerto Rico and the West, and in parts of the Plains, Great Lakes and Carolinas.\nBillion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters\nOne new billion-dollar weather and climate disaster was confirmed this month after a severe weather event impacted the central and southern U.S. during mid-March, with the most severe weather occurring on March 13\u201315.\nSince these billion-dollar disaster records began in 1980, the U.S. has sustained 378 separate weather and climate disasters where overall damages/costs reached or exceeded $1 billion (based on the CPI adjustment to 2024) per event. The total cost of these 378 events exceeds $2.675 trillion.\nOther Notable Events\nPersistent heat brought record-breaking temperatures to portions of the U.S. during March:\nOn March 12\u201315 powerful storms brought baseball-sized hail and more than 20 tornadoes to portions of the Midwest:\nA blizzard in early March blasted parts of Sierra Nevada with gusts of up to 190 mph and more than 10 feet of snow, shattering the \u201csnow drought\u201d and significantly boosting vital snowpack levels.\nFive wildfires, including the Smokehouse Creek wildfire, were finally contained in the Texas Panhandle, the largest cattle-producing region in the world. The wildfires resulted in approximately 1.1 million acres scorched, hundreds of destroyed structures, hundreds of miles of ruined fencing and more than 7,000 dead cattle.\nSnow drought occurred in the Southeast, as Asheville, Greensboro and Charlotte, North Carolina, had their longest streaks with no measurable snowfall through March. The last measurable snows in those cities were recorded on March 13, January 17 and January 30, 2022, respectively.\nSnow depth across Anchorage remained above two feet by the end of March\u2014the second-highest depth ever recorded this late in March.\nYear-to-Date Highlights\nJanuary-March Temperature\nFor the January-March period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 39.4\u00b0F, 4.2\u00b0F above average, ranking fifth warmest on record for this period.\nTemperatures were above average across most of the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast.\nWisconsin, Michigan, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine each ranked second warmest on record, while an additional 15 states ranked in their top-10 warmest year-to-date period. No state experienced a top-10 coldest event for this three-month period.\nThe contiguous U.S. average maximum (daytime) temperature during January-March was 50.0\u00b0F, 3.9\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking 11th warmest in the historical record. Above-average temperatures were observed across much of the conterminous U.S., while near- to below-average temperatures were observed in parts of the West, western Plains and Southeast. Wisconsin and Michigan each ranked second-warmest on record for daytime temperatures during the January-March period. An additional 19 states ranked among their top-10 warmest for daytime temperatures during this period.\nThe contiguous U.S. average minimum (nighttime) temperature during this three-month period was 28.8\u00b0F, 4.6\u00b0F above the 20th century average, ranking fourth warmest in the historical record. Above-average nighttime temperatures were observed across nearly all of the Lower 48, while near- to below-average temperatures were observed in small portions of the West, Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. New Hampshire and Vermont each ranked warmest on record, while 21 additional states ranked among their top-10 warmest January-March period on record for nighttime temperatures.\nThe Alaska January-March temperature was 9.4\u00b0F, 3.5\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Much of the state was above average for the three-month period while temperatures were near average across the eastern portions of the state and in parts of the Aleutians and Panhandle.\nBased on REDTI, the contiguous U.S. temperature-related energy demand during January-March was 27 percent of average and was the fifth-lowest value on record.\nJanuary-March Precipitation\nThe January-March precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 8.15 inches, 1.19 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record.\nPrecipitation was above average across much of the contiguous U.S., with Rhode Island having its second-wettest year-to-date period on record. Six additional states ranked among their top-10 wettest on record for this three-month period.\nConversely, precipitation was below average across much of the northern Plains and in small parts of the Northwest, central and southern Plains, Ohio Valley and Southeast during the January\u2013March period. No states ranked among their top-10 driest year-to-date period on record.\nThe January-March precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record, with above-average precipitation observed in parts of the North Slope, West Coast and Southeast, while below-normal precipitation was observed in parts of the central Interior and south-central Alaska, as well as southern portions of the Panhandle during this period.\nExtremes\nThe U.S. Climate Extremes Index (USCEI) for the year-to-date period was 6 percent above average, ranking in the upper third of the 115-year period of record. Extremes in warm maximum and minimum temperatures were the major contributors to this elevated CEI value. The USCEI is an index that tracks extremes (occurring in the upper or lower 10 percent of the record) in temperature, precipitation and drought across the contiguous United States.\nOn the regional scale, the Southwest and Ohio Valley were above average while the Northeast and Upper Midwest ranked much-above average with the Northeast experiencing the largest extent of extremes on record for this period. Each of these regions experienced elevated extremes in warm minimum temperatures, while the Ohio Valley, Northeast and Upper Midwest also observed elevated extremes in warm maximum temperatures. Wet PDSI and extremes in one-day precipitation were elevated across much of the Northeast, while extremes in dry PDSI blanketed more than one third of the Upper Midwest. Below-average extremes were observed across the South, Northwest and West regions during this three-month period.\nMonthly Outlook\nAccording to the March 31 One-Month Outlook from the Climate Prediction Center, above-normal monthly average temperatures in April are favored to impact much of the central U.S., Northwest and Northeast. Above-normal monthly precipitation is likely from much of the Plains to parts of the East Coast and in much of the Southwest during April. Drought is likely to persist along portions of the Northern Tier, the Southwest, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\nAccording to the One-Month Outlook issued on April 1 from the National Interagency Fire Center, much of the Upper Midwest and in parts of the central and southern Plains have an above-normal significant wildland fire potential during the month of April, while much of southeastern U.S. and areas along the Gulf Coast are expected to have below-normal potential for the month.\nRegional Highlights\nThese regional summaries were provided by the six Regional Climate Centers and reflect conditions in their respective regions. These six regions differ spatially from the nine climatic regions of the National Centers for Environmental Information.\nNortheast  (Information provided by the Northeast Regional Climate Center) \nAn unusually warm, record-wet March featured record low snowfall in some locations.\nThe Northeast had its 10th warmest March since records began in 1895, with an average temperature of 39.8 degrees F, 5.3 degrees F above normal. State average temperatures for March ranged from 4.0 degrees F above normal in Rhode Island to 5.9 degrees F above normal in New York. This March ranked among the 12 warmest for all 12 Northeast states: Connecticut, eighth warmest; Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, and New Jersey, ninth warmest; New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and West Virginia, 11th warmest; and New Hampshire, 12th warmest.\nIt was the fifth-wettest March since 1895 for the Northeast, which picked up 5.38 inches of precipitation, 151 percent of normal. March precipitation for the 12 Northeast states ranged from 79 percent of normal in West Virginia, the lone drier-than-normal state, to 230 percent of normal in Maine. March 2024 ranked among the 17 wettest Marches on record for 10 of the states: Delaware, Maine, and Rhode Island, second wettest; Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Vermont, third wettest; Connecticut, fourth wettest; Maryland, 13th wettest; and New York, 17th wettest. March 2024 became the wettest March on record for seven major climate sites: Bridgeport, Connecticut; Kennedy Airport, New York; LaGuardia Airport, New York; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Islip, New York; Caribou, Maine; and Albany, New York.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor from March 5 showed less than one percent of the Northeast in moderate drought and three percent as abnormally dry. Moderate drought and abnormal dryness expanded slightly in western New York in response to continued precipitation deficits and much below-normal streamflow and groundwater levels. Meanwhile, moderate drought persisted on Nantucket, Massachusetts, driven mostly by reduced groundwater levels. However, conditions improved enough in northwestern Pennsylvania to ease abnormal dryness there. The U.S. Drought Monitor from March 26 showed less than one percent of the Northeast in moderate drought and two percent as abnormally dry. During March, western New York experienced record low or much below normal groundwater levels and 7-day streamflow, based on USGS data. During the spring fire season in the Mid-Atlantic, locally dry conditions contributed to multiple wildfires that burned several structures, led to evacuations, and reduced air quality in some locations.\nFrom March 10 to 12, a complex storm system brought heavy rain and snow to the Northeast, with precipitation totals of up to 3 inches. Coastal areas from Maryland to Maine saw mostly rain, while interior areas saw more of a mix of precipitation types, particularly higher elevations of northern New York and northern New England where the greatest snowfall totals approached 13 inches. Wind gusts of 30 to 60 mph accompanied the storm, with locally higher gusts generally along the coast. The gusty winds brought down trees and wires, resulting in power outages and contributing to a death in Pennsylvania, and led to temporary ground stops at airports such as Newark International Airport in New Jersey and Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia. Meanwhile, coastal flooding in New England led to some road closures. From March 20 to 21, a storm moving across northern parts of the Northeast brought snow mostly to northern New England, particularly the higher elevations which generally saw the greatest snowfall totals of 8 to 12 inches. A Blizzard Warning was issued by the NOAA National Weather Service office in Caribou, Maine, for northern parts of that state as heavy snow was blown around by wind gusts as high as 50 mph. In southern parts of the region like West Virginia and Maryland, gusty winds of up to 60 mph downed trees and power lines. A major storm system delivered flooding rain, heavy snow, and ice to the Northeast from March 23 to 24. Much of the Mid-Atlantic, southeastern New York, and a large portion of southern New England saw mostly rain, with the greatest totals of 3 to 5 inches generally along the Interstate 95 corridor from southeastern Pennsylvania into southern Connecticut. March 23 became the wettest March day since recordkeeping began for LaGuardia Airport, New York (3.47 in.); Kennedy Airport, New York (3.13 in.); and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (3.09 in.). It was among the three wettest March days for six other major climate sites including Central Park, New York; Wilmington, Delaware; and Concord, New Hampshire. The heavy rain resulted in localized flooding that closed roads, led to water rescues, suspended transportation services, and inundated buildings in some of these areas. Additionally, there was one flood-related fatality in southeastern Pennsylvania. Much of New York and northern New England saw a mix of precipitation types including freezing rain and snow. In fact, the storm produced one of the snow season\u2019s largest snowfalls for an area stretching from northern and eastern New York into western and northern Maine, with the greatest storm totals ranging from 18 to 30 inches. For instance, Caribou, Maine, and Burlington, Vermont, had their greatest daily snowfall of the snow season on March 23 with 10.9 inches of snow and 8.6 inches, respectively. Some locations in New York and New England saw several hours of freezing rain, with reports of 0.50 inches to 0.75 inches of ice accumulation in places like Portland, Maine, and Albany, New York. Wind gusts of up to 50 mph accompanied the storm, with locally higher gusts in places like New York\u2019s Long Island. Factors such as gusty winds, saturated ground, heavy snow, or ice accumulation brought down trees and power lines, blocking roads and resulting in power outages. For example, in Maine, dozens of roads were closed and over 200,000 customers lost power. The weather conditions also contributed to flight delays and cancellations, as well as vehicle accidents, across the Northeast. However, the snowfall gave some northern New England ski resorts a bump in attendance and allowed them to slightly extend their season. Outside of northern New England, snowfall was generally below normal. March 2024 was the least snowy March on record, tying several other years in most cases, for nine major climate sites: Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston, Massachusetts; Williamsport, Pennsylvania; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Islip, New York; Providence, Rhode Island; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Huntington, West Virginia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In fact, even with the March snowfall boost in northern New England, the snow season, which started in October, has generally been lackluster. For instance, some ski resorts relied heavily on snowmaking operations and the snowmobiling season in northern Maine ended about a month earlier than usual, with losses expected for businesses that rely on revenue from tourism. In early March, officials in northern Maine asked folks to remove their ice fishing shacks from local waterways due to rapidly changing ice conditions, while the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation warned hikers in the Adirondacks to \u201cpostpone high elevation activities due to unstable spring conditions\u201d usually more typical of late March to mid-April. Peak bloom of cherry blossoms in Washington, D.C., occurred on March 17, tying as the second earliest date since 1921. The earliest peak bloom was March 15, 2000. Plants budding or blooming earlier than usual has also been noted in other areas like western New York and eastern Massachusetts, with allergy season arriving early and possibly being more intense in multiple parts of the Northeast. Additionally, some golf courses opened for the season during March.\nFor more information, please visit the Northeast Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nMidwest Region (Information provided by the Midwest Regional Climate Center)\nThe average March temperature for the Midwest was 40.5 degrees F (4.7 degrees C), which was 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees C) above the 1991-2020 normal. Anomalous warmth was present across the entire region, with temperatures 1-3 degrees F (0.6-1.7 degrees C) above normal in the northwest to more than 6 degrees F (3.3 degrees C) above normal in the central and eastern portions of the region. Preliminary statewide average temperatures ranged from 1.8 degrees F (1 degree C) above normal in Minnesota to 4.6 degrees F (2.6 degrees C) above normal in Michigan. The first two weeks of the month had widespread warmth. Kansas City, Missouri, had its 5th earliest 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C) day on March 3. Near-normal and slightly below-normal temperatures returned to the region for the last two weeks of the month. Many long-running stations across the area, particularly in the central Midwest, had a top ten warmest March.\nMarch precipitation totaled 2.62 inches (67 mm) for the Midwest, which was 0.05 inches (1 mm) above normal, or 102 percent of normal. Precipitation was up to 5 inches (127 mm) above normal across the Great Lakes and down to 3 inches (76.2 mm) below normal along the Ohio River. Preliminary statewide precipitation totals ranged from 1.76 inches (45 mm) below normal in Kentucky to 0.9 inches (23 mm) above normal in Michigan. Precipitation rankings across most Midwestern cities were unremarkable, except in Milwaukee, which had its third wettest March in 151 years.\nThe Midwest had some drought improvement throughout March. About 38 percent of the region started the month affected by drought. Drought coverage was reduced to about 27 percent by month\u2019s end. The epicenter of drought remained locked across eastern Iowa, with a large area affected by extreme (D3) drought, while the western half of the state had one category improvement on the US Drought Monitor map. Drought improvements were noted across Missouri, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, although dryness and drought remained. Areas around the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers trended drier in March, and drought development was an increasing concern.\nMarch snowfall was confined to the upper Midwest, where totals ranged from 2-25 inches (5.1-63.5 cm). Snowfall was within 5 inches (12.7 cm) above or below normal throughout most of Iowa and Michigan. Conversely, Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin had 5-15 inches (12.7-38.1 cm) of above-normal snowfall for March. Minneapolis measured 15.2 inches (38.6 cm) of snow for the month, which was more snow than they received from Oct 2023 \u2013 Feb 2024.\nHundreds of hail, tornado, and severe wind reports were noted across the Midwest on March 13-14 along an axis from southern Missouri to central Ohio. Large hail measuring 3-4 inches (76.2-101.6 mm) was reported in the St. Louis, Missouri, area. There were three fatalities and 27 injuries when an EF-3 tornado traversed Ohio\u2019s Auglaize and Logan counties. Two people were injured when an EF-2 tornado touched down in Jefferson County, Indiana. Another 38 injuries were reported associated with an EF-3 tornado west of Selma, Indiana. At least 17 tornadoes were confirmed in the Midwest during this outbreak.\nFor more information, please visit the Midwest Climate Watch Home page.\nSoutheast (Information provided by the Southeast Regional Climate Center)\nTemperatures were above average across the Southeast in March, except in parts of southern Alabama, where temperatures were slightly below average. The greatest departures were found across the Florida Peninsula, southern Georgia, eastern portions of the Carolinas, and northern Virginia, where mean temperatures were 4 to 6 degrees F (2.2 to 3.4 degrees C) above average for the month. Key West, FL recorded its third warmest March on record (since 1871), while Fort Lauderdale, FL tied its third warmest March on record (since 1912). Above average temperatures persisted across the U.S. Caribbean. Saint Croix recorded its warmest March on record (since 1951) with a mean temperature of 81.7 degrees F (27.6 degrees C), breaking the previous record of 80.9 degrees F (27.2 degrees C) set in 1981. San Juan, PR tied its second warmest March on record (since 1898). Heat advisories were issued on the island for the 19th, with heat index values near 100 degrees F (37.8 degrees C) in San Juan and Mayaguez. \nThe month began with unseasonably warm weather. Mean temperatures were 5 to 15 degrees F (2.8 to 8.3 degrees C) above average across much of the region through the first week of March, with some locations as much as 20 degrees F (11.1 degrees C) above average along the northern tier. After a brief period of near to slightly below average temperatures, warm weather returned around the middle of the month, with several locations running over 20 degrees F (11.1 degrees C) above average. Maximum temperatures reached 80 degrees F (26.7 degrees C) for the first time this year across northern Virginia on the 14th and 15th, which is 2 to 3 weeks earlier than average. In Florida, maximum temperatures reached 90 degrees F (32.2 degrees C) for the first time this year in places like West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Miami on the 17th and 18th, which is at least a month earlier than average. This period of warm weather was followed by several days of unseasonably cool temperatures, with mean temperatures running 5 to 15 degrees F (2.8 to 8.3 degrees C) below average from the 19th through the 21st. Minimum temperatures dropped below freezing along the northern Gulf Coast. Highlands, NC, located above 4,000 feet (1,219 m) elevation in southwestern North Carolina, recorded a minimum temperature of 17 degrees F (-8.3 degrees C) on the 20th, making it the fifth coldest monthly minimum temperature on record (since 1877). After a brief warm-up, cooler temperatures returned to the region from the 24th to the 29th, with many locations across the northern tier of the region running 5 to 10 degrees F (2.8 to 5.6 degrees C) below average. Subfreezing temperatures were recorded across northern portions of Alabama and Georgia. March ended with more unseasonably warm weather across much of the region. Raleigh-Durham, NC reached 85 degrees F (29.4 degrees C) for the first time this year on the 31st, which is at least 2 weeks earlier than average.\nPrecipitation was above average across most of the Southeast in March. The wettest locations were found across southern portions of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, as well as eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia, where monthly totals were 4 to 8 inches (102 to 203 mm) above average (over 200 percent of normal). Cape Hatteras, NC recorded its wettest March on record (since 1874) with 13.86 inches (352 mm), breaking the previous record of 11.20 inches (284 mm) set in 1989. This included 3.75 inches (95 mm) on the 4th, which is the third wettest March day on record. Further north, Norfolk, VA recorded its second wettest March on record (since 1871) with 10.30 inches (262 mm) of precipitation. Charleston, SC recorded 8.12 inches (206 mm) for the month, which is nearly 2.5 times its expected monthly total. This included 3.04 inches (77 mm) on the 1st, which is the fourth wettest March day on record (since 1938). Also on the 1st, Asheville, NC recorded 1.63 inches (41 mm) of precipitation, which is more than it recorded during the entire month of February (1.24 inches (31 mm)). On the 9th, an area of low pressure tracked northeastward across the region, resulting in heavy precipitation and severe weather. Americus, GA, located in the southwestern part of the state, recorded its third wettest March day on record (since 1876) with 4.80 inches (122 mm). Downtown Charleston, SC also recorded 3.63 inches (92 mm), which is the wettest March day on record (since 1893). Another low pressure system tracked across the region on the 22nd and 23rd, resulting in widespread totals of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm). Eastern portions of North Carolina and Virginia recorded up to 4 inches (102 mm), while parts of South Florida recorded over 5 inches (127 mm) of precipitation over the two days. Several days later, one final low pressure system tracked across the Southeast, bringing more heavy precipitation to the region on the 27th and 28th. A swath of 1 to 2 inches (25 to 51 mm) extended from Florida to eastern Virginia, with some locations recording over 3 inches (76 mm). Norfolk, VA recorded 3.06 inches (78 mm) on the 28th, which is the third wettest March day on record (since 1871). While most of the region was wetter than average in March, some locations recorded below average totals for the month, including western portions of Virginia such as Charlottesville (84 percent of normal), Blacksburg (62 percent of normal) and Roanoke (83 percent of normal), as well as parts of central Florida, such as Orlando (46 percent of normal). \nPrecipitation was variable across the U.S. Caribbean. Above average precipitation was observed across the northern and southern slopes of Puerto Rico, while below average precipitation was observed along the eastern and western slopes as well as the outlying islands. Trujillo, located in the northern coastal region, recorded 4.27 inches (108 mm) on the 26th, making it the second wettest March day on record (since 1957). Precipitation was generally below average in Saint Thomas and near average in Saint Croix. Most CoCoRaHS gauges in Saint John recorded less than 1 inch (25 mm) for the month. \nIn terms of winter precipitation, trace amounts of snowfall, ice pellets, and up to 0.1 inches (2.5 mm) of freezing rain were reported across western portions of North Carolina and Virginia on the 1st of the month. Up to 0.5 inches (13 mm) of snow was reported across northern and western portions of Virginia, as well as western portions of North Carolina on the 10th of the month. Trace amounts of snow were also reported across western Virginia on the 18th and 19th. For the month, Mount Mitchell, NC recorded just a trace of snow. This ties the lowest March snowfall total on record (since 1925). The lack of snowfall has been persistent across parts of the region. On the 18th of the month, Asheville, NC and Charlotte, NC broke their previous records for the greatest number of consecutive days without measurable snowfall with runs of 737 and 779 days, respectively. Other locations reached one of their top 5 longest runs of days without measurable snowfall, including Greenville-Spartanburg, SC, Greensboro, NC, and Raleigh-Durham, NC.\nDrought conditions generally improved in March. Abnormal dryness (D0) was eliminated across the interior of the region and along the northern Gulf Coast but persisted across the West Coast of Florida and eastern portions of North Carolina. A very small pocket of moderate (D1) drought also persisted in eastern North Carolina. Over 97 percent of the region was free of any drought or abnormal dryness at the end of the month, the highest percentage since September 2021. Drought conditions also improved in Puerto Rico. Abnormal dryness (D0) was eliminated across the interior of the island. Moderate (D1) drought was also eliminated on the southwestern end of the island and contracted on the northwestern and eastern ends. Abnormal dryness (D0) persisted on Saint Thomas, while Saint John and Saint Croix remained free of any drought or abnormal dryness.\nWet conditions limited field activities in parts of Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, and delayed some spring planting, notably for corn and other vegetables. Wet conditions also caused issues with seed germination and led to rotting of some young seedlings. Heavy precipitation in parts of southwest Georgia caused some agricultural facilities to flood and spoiled cases of produce before they could be shipped. Freezing temperatures during the month damaged some of the peach crop in South Carolina, though most peaches in Georgia were unharmed. Strawberries and blueberries were also spared as farmers were able to cover their crops ahead of time. While many places continued to see too much precipitation, some locations benefited from the additional moisture, especially across Florida, where the greening of pastures helped improve grazing conditions and reduced the amount of supplemental feed needed for livestock. Warm temperature and adequate soil moisture also allowed for preparation of spring planting across much of the state.\nThere were 101 reports of severe weather across the Southeast in March, which is less than half of the median frequency of 208 reports over the period 2000 to 2022 (49 percent of normal). There were five confirmed tornadoes (1 EF-0, 3 EF-1s, 1 EF-2), which is below the median frequency of 20 (25 percent of normal). Four of these occurred across southern Alabama and Georgia, and northern Florida as part of a severe weather outbreak on the 9th of the month. Most of the damage consisted of downed trees with some structural damage to homes and outbuildings. The strongest tornado was an EF-2 that touched down near the community of Nahunta in Brantley County, GA, causing extensive damage to mobile homes, some of which were flattened and wrapped around trees. At least five people were injured. \nThere were 57 wind reports in March, which is below the median frequency of 119 reports (48 percent of normal). Wind gusts over 50 mph (22 m/s) were reported from Florida to Virginia in association with the low pressure system that tracked through the region on the 9th and 10th of the month. Some gusts approached 70 mph (31 m/s) across parts of southwestern Virginia and northwestern North Carolina. Wind gusts over 60 mph (27 m/s) were reported across portions of Alabama and Georgia on the 15th and 16th. These storms also produced golf ball-sized hail and an EF-0 tornado in DeKalb County, AL. Wind gusts of 50 to 60 mph (22 to 27 m/s) were recorded across coastal sections of North Carolina and Virginia in association with the low pressure system off the East Coast from the 23rd to the 25th of the month. A severe thunderstorm produced a 75 mph (34 m/s) wind gust in Valdosta, GA on the morning of the 27th, resulting in downed trees that destroyed over 30 homes. There were 38 hail reports in March, which is below the median frequency of 69 reports (55 percent of normal). The largest hailstone was 2 inches (51 mm), or hen egg-sized, in the community of White City in Gulf County, FL on the 27th of the month. \nThe famous Cherry Blossoms in Washington D.C. reached their peak bloom on the 17th of the month, which tied for the second earliest bloom date since the National Park Service began tracking their phenology in 1921. The earliest bloom date on record is just two days earlier (March 15, 1990). Raleigh, NC recorded a daily pollen concentration of 2,040 grains per cubic meter on the 21st of the month, which is the fourth highest daily concentration and highest concentration to date in the season since 2002. On the 25th, Atlanta, GA recorded a daily concentration of 4,117 grains per cubic meter, which is the highest value to date in the season since 2012. There were five rip current fatalities in March, all in Puerto Rico.\nFor more information, please visit the Southeast Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nHigh Plains (Information provided by the High Plains Regional Climate Center)\nA late winter storm impacted the region at the end of March, bringing blizzard conditions and severe weather. Despite the significant storm, much of the region received below normal precipitation this month. \nIn a typical display of the unpredictability and whiplash of the plains, parts of western Kansas were under both tornado and blizzard warnings at the same time. Several tornadoes touched down, followed by up to 6 inches (15.24 cm) of snow and wind gusts of 40 mph (64 km/h). A brief EF-1 tornado with 90 mph (145 km/h) winds hit the town of Garden City, causing minor damage.\nThe winter weather associated with the system wreaked havoc in nearly every state in the region. Major interstates were closed, with poor road conditions stretching from Kansas to North Dakota. The hardest hit states were Colorado and South Dakota, with reports of up to 12 inches (30.48 cm) of snow. Strong winds led to whiteout conditions, leading to a rash of wrecks.\nMarch brought cooler temperatures for parts of the west, while the eastern portions of the region remained warm. The system that pushed through the region in late March led to a cool-down for many.\nWhile temperatures for the month were on both ends of the spectrum, nothing was out of the ordinary. The only major location to rank in the top 10 warmest or coldest was Laramie, Wyoming. The city ranked as the 8th warmest with an average temperature of 35.3 degrees F (1.8 degrees C), while surrounding locations such as Cheyenne or Rawlins were just outside the top 10. \nThe front that pushed through late in the month provided some relief to the eastern parts of the region. While no records were broken, it did lead temperatures to drop below freezing for some and created potential issues for blooming plants.\nPrecipitation was spotty throughout the region except for Colorado. Parts of the state experienced record wetness, while parts of south-central Kansas reported trace to no precipitation. \nMuch of the precipitation in Colorado this month was snow, falling from a significant storm in the middle of the month. Highways were closed across the state and over 800 flights were canceled at Denver International Airport. The snow was extremely heavy, leading to branches breaking and causing scattered power outages. Over 60 inches (152.4 cm) fell in parts of the Rockies, while portions of the foothills received over 12 inches (30.48 cm) this month. Canon City and Fruita crushed their precipitation records by over an inch (2.54 cm) due to the exceptional wetness.\nWhile much of Nebraska was dry, a record-setting snowstorm impacted North Platte early this month. In the city, 15.3 inches (38.86 cm) of snow fell on the 7th and set a new single-day record. The snow was extremely heavy at times, with up to 3 inches (7.62 cm) falling per hour. This narrow band stretched to the Broken Bow area; however, snowfall totals were much lower elsewhere. \nDespite most of Colorado being wet, the eastern plains were very dry. Minimal amounts of precipitation were reported around Campo and Lamar, with some areas receiving less than 0.10 inches (2.54 mm). Just across the border in Kansas, areas between Dodge City and Wichita received similar amounts resulting in drought expansion.\nDrought conditions within the region are in decent shape at the end of March. Expansion and intensification were sporadic, but not serious. Overall, the region observed a slight increase of less than a percent of D0 to D4 (abnormally dry to exceptional drought conditions).\nThe drought that has plagued central and eastern Nebraska has slowly improved over the past few months, with a pocket of D2 (severe drought) remaining between Lincoln and Grand Island. This is a significant improvement over the previous year, when D4 was present within the state.\nSimilar to Nebraska, Kansas is in much better shape than 2023. Although there was a slight intensification in the south-central part of the state where it was nearly bone-dry, the current situation is significantly less bleak than the previous year when D4 covered the southwestern portions of the state. Elsewhere in the region, other improvements and degradation were observed.\nFor more information, please visit the High Plains Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nSouth (Information provided by the Southern Regional Climate Center)\nHeavy rains led to flooding and school closures across Arkansas on March 15th. The largest wildfire in Texas state history continued to impact the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma in early March.\nTemperatures were above normal across much of the Southern Region during March, with stations in the northern portions of the region recording temperatures as much as 5 degrees F above normal. The only area recording below normal temperatures was Far West Texas, where temperatures were zero to two degrees F below normal. Statewide averages were above normal for all states in the Region: Oklahoma (22nd warmest, out of 130 years), Tennessee (23rd warmest), the Southern Region as a whole (25th warmest), Texas (27th warmest), Arkansas (28th warmest), Mississippi (38th warmest), and Louisiana (39th warmest). The warmest recorded temperature in the Region was 99 F at three stations, all in Texas: Laredo on March 13th. Faith Ranch on March 13th, and Rio Grande Village on March 30th. The coldest recorded temperature was 9 F at Mt. Leconte, Tennessee on March 19th. The coldest lowland temperature was 14 F near Goodwell, Oklahoma on March 26th. No long-term stations in the Southern Region set records for highest maximum monthly or lowest minimum monthly temperature during March.\nPrecipitation was mixed across the Southern Region during March. Much of Louisiana, Mississippi, East Texas, and southern Arkansas recorded precipitation ranging from 125 and 200 percent of normal. The remainder of the Region was near to below normal with the driest conditions being recorded in the west of the Region. State totals were above normal for Mississippi (27th wettest) and Louisiana (34th wettest) and below normal for Tennessee (41st driest). Precipitation totals for Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and the Southern Region as a whole were near their historical median values. Three stations, one WBAN and two CoCoRaHS, recorded more than 13 inches of precipitation in March: near Collinsville, Mississippi (13.83 inches), New Orleans Audubon, Louisiana (13.32 inches), and near Monroe, Louisiana (13.13 inches). Two stations, both in Arkansas, reported more than six inches of precipitation on one day: Magnolia (7.2 inches, March 15th) and El Dorado (6.3 inches, March 15th). Six long-term stations set single day accumulations records for March with the greatest difference between the old and new records being Magnolia, Arkansas on March 15th (7.2 inches vs 5.95 inches).\nDuring March, drought conditions remained largely steady across the Southern Region, with some areas of Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and East Texas seeing improvements in existing drought conditions of one to two categories, according to the US Drought Monitor. The only areas experiencing degradation in drought conditions were north-central Oklahoma and isolated areas of Central and South Texas. As of March 26th, Louisiana and Arkansas are essentially drought free; none of the Region is in Exceptional Drought. Given normal to above average precipitation for much of the Region over the previous months, subsoil moisture has rebounded across the Region with the USDA reporting at least 50 percent of land having Adequate subsoil moisture in all states in the Region except Texas which reported 46 percent of land having Adequate subsoil moisture. Planting of field crops began in southern portions of the Region during March with Texas and Louisiana reporting 32 and 51 percent of rice acres planted and Texas reporting 57 percent of corn acres planted as of March 31st.\nThe Smokehouse Creek Fire, which began in February, continued to affect the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. The fire was 100 percent contained as of March 16th according to the Texas A&M Forest Service. In total, the fire destroyed over 100 homes, burned over a million acres of rangeland, killed thousands of cattle, and led to two confirmed fatalities in Texas. The fire is the largest recorded in Texas state history and the largest in the United States so far in 2024. Heavy rains associated with thunderstorms on March 15th led to reports of flooding across portions of Arkansas and caused Magnolia Arkansas Public Schools to close for the day.\nThere were 11 tornadoes reported across the Southern Region in March: 7 rated EF0, 3 EF1, and 1 EF2 affecting the states of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi. There were no injuries or fatalities associated with these tornadoes. There were 172 reports of hail across the Region in March, with the largest being 5.25 inches near Ada, Oklahoma on March 14th. There were 86 severe wind reports with the fastest being 77 mph on March 15th near Sugar Land, Texas.\nFor more information, please visit the Southern Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nWest (Information provided by the Western Region Climate Center)\nMarch came in like a lion for California and much of the Southwest as a powerful, multi-day storm impacted the region bringing heavy rain and mountain snow, and high winds. Mid-month saw a lull in storms and then several slow moving, cutoff low-pressure systems impacted the Southwest again during the latter half of the month. Regionally, the Southwest saw well above normal precipitation and temperatures were near-to-below normal. Continued dry and warm conditions persisted for much of the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies with record low snowpack for some locations raising concerns about worsening drought conditions.\nTemperatures were one to three degrees Fahrenheit above normal (in the 70th to 90th percentile) for much of Washington, northern Idaho, western Montana, and southeast New Mexico. Quillayute, Washington, on the Olympic Peninsula, had a monthly average temperature of 47.5 degrees Fahrenheit, 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and the third warmest on record; Portland, Oregon mean monthly temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Below normal temperatures were found throughout north central Montana, California, the Great Basin, and much of Arizona. The Sierra Nevada, California was one of the colder locations in the West; mean monthly temperature departures were 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Blue Canyon, 3.4 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Yosemite Village, and 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit below normal at Tahoe City.\nConditions were generally drier than normal in Washington, northern Oregon, northern Idaho, western Montana, and southeast New Mexico. The Washington Cascades and parts of the Rockies in Montana were particularly dry with SNOTEL stations reporting 40 percent to 60 percent of normal monthly precipitation; six SNOTEL stations in Washington and five in Montana are reporting the second lowest March precipitation totals on record. Low precipitation is being reflected in the well below normal snowpack in this region. Several strong storms impacted the Southwest bringing above normal monthly precipitation to the Sierra Nevada, northern Great Basin, most of Utah, and the mountains of Arizona and New Mexico; most SNOTEL sites in this region reported greater than 150 percent of normal precipitation for the month. In southeast Idaho, both Pocatello and Idaho Falls had the wettest march on record with 3.28 inches and 1.98 inches, respectively. Reno, Nevada logged 2.20 inches of precipitation coming in as the fourth wettest March on record.\nAccording to the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) at the end of March, 23 percent of the West was in drought. Areas of extreme (D3) and exceptional (D4) drought are found in far southeast Arizona, southern New Mexico, and western Montana. Minor drought improvements were made throughout much of the West. However, the April 1 snowpack across Washington, northern Idaho, and western Montana was well below normal, and at record low levels for some locations, and worsening drought conditions are expected heading into summer as a result.\nPrecipitation was below normal for much of South Central, the Interior, and the southern half of the Panhandle. Ketchikan received 8.34 inches of precipitation for the month at 76 percent of normal and Petersburg received 4.87 inches at 64 percent of normal; this continues a several month dry stretch for the southern Panhandle which has led to below normal snowpack and potential summer drought impacts. Western coastal Alaska saw above normal precipitation with Nome at 228 percent of normal and Kotzebue at 173 percent of normal. Most of the state saw temperature anomalies of one to four degrees Fahrenheit above normal with some isolated areas in southern Alaska much warmer including Northway at 6.8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal and Talkeetna at 6.1 degrees Fahrenheit above normal. Parts of southwest Alaska had slightly below normal temperatures.\nHawaii saw drier than normal conditions across the entire chain of islands except for the east coast of the Big Island. Lihue had its sixth driest March with 0.89 inches of precipitation (16 percent of normal), Molokai had its sixth driest March with 0.45 inches of precipitation (15 percent of normal), and Honolulu the tenth driest with 0.23 inches of precipitation (10 percent of normal). Drought currently covers 42 percent of Hawaii with severe drought (D2) found only on the Big Island and Maui; spatial drought coverage has increased since the start of the calendar year but is still much less than the 81 percent of area covered at the start of the water year.\nFour-day blizzard buries Sierra Nevada and strands motorists: A powerful storm impacted California during the first four days of March with the northern Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, being one of the hardest hit areas. Five to seven feet of snow fell, with locally higher amounts, and strong winds gusted to over 150 mph. Large Sierra storms are common; however, this storm was one of the strongest in the past 40 years when considering 4-days increases in snow water equivalent. Many cars and tractor trailers were stranded overnight on interstate 80 as extreme conditions forced the closure of the road without being able to first get all vehicles to safety. No injuries were reported.\nFor more information, please go to the Western Regional Climate Center Home Page.\nCiting This Report\nMetadata\nFOLLOW US\nCONTACT US\n",

Temperatures were above average to record warm across much of the western U.S. and from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Arizona, California, Florida, Maine and New Hampshire each had their warmest summer on record.  \nThe Alaska summer temperature was 51.7\u00b0F, 1.3\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the record for the state. Temperatures were above-average across much of the state, while parts of the West Coast and Bristol Bay saw near-average summer temperatures.\nFor the January\u2013August period, the average contiguous U.S. temperature was 56.9\u00b0F, 3.0\u00b0F above average, ranking second warmest on record. Temperatures were above average across the contiguous U.S., while record-warm temperatures were observed in parts of the Northeast, Ohio Valley and South. New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia each saw their warmest January\u2013August period on record.\nThe Alaska January\u2013August temperature was 31.2\u00b0F, 2.4\u00b0F above the long-term average, ranking in the warmest third of the historical record for the state. Most of the state was warmer than average.\n\n\nSummer Precipitation Recap\nThe U.S. summer precipitation total was near-average with a total of 8.30 inches, ranking in the middle third of the June\u2013August record. Precipitation was above average across portions of the Upper Midwest, and in parts of the Northeast, Southeast, Gulf Coast and central Rockies. Michigan saw its fifth-wettest summer on record. Summer precipitation was below average from the Ohio Valley to the Gulf Coast, from the northern Rockies to California and across portions of the central and southern Plains. West Virginia had its fifth-driest summer on record.  \nFor summer season precipitation, Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the record with wetter-than-average conditions observed across most of the state. Precipitation was below average in parts of the South Panhandle, Southeast Interior and the Aleutians.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation total for the contiguous U.S. was 22.93 inches, 2.23 inches above average, ranking 10th wettest in the 130-year record. Precipitation was above average across a large portion of the Upper Midwest, Northeast and Deep South, with Rhode Island and Connecticut both ranking second wettest. Conversely, precipitation was below average across parts of the Northwest, northern Plains, central Appalachians and west Texas during the January\u2013August period.  \nThe January\u2013August precipitation for Alaska ranked in the wettest third of the 100-year record.\n\nFall Temperature Outlook\nAbove-normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern and eastern contiguous U.S. (CONUS) and northwestern Alaska during October, November, and December. Conversely, below normal temperatures are more likely for much of southern Alaska. Equal Chances of below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern and north-central CONUS. Above normal temperatures remain likely (greater than 60 percent) across the Southwest, due to good agreement among both dynamical and statistical guidance. The area of favored above-normal temperatures is expanded to include much of California due to a stronger signal in this month\u2019s consolidation.\n\nWinter Precipitation Outlook\nModel and statistical guidance remains generally consistent from previous months depicting elevated probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes, and parts of the Northeast during October, November, and December. However, despite dynamical models favoring below-normal precipitation in the Southeast, Equal Chances is indicated due to the potential for tropical activity early in the season and increased probabilities for a wet October. Precipitation consolidation guidance has trended wetter across the northern tier of the CONUS, resulting in an expansion of elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities across parts of the northern High Plains and Great Lakes relative to last month. Above-normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska.\n\nImpacts and Outlooks for Your Region\nMap of the United States depicting the Seasonal Precipitation Outlook for October\u2013December 2024.\n\nAlaska and Northwestern Canada Region\u00a0\nGreat Lakes Region\nGulf Coast Region\nGulf of Maine Region\nMid-Atlantic Region\u00a0\nMidwest Region\nMissouri River Basin Region\nPrairies and High Plains Region\nNortheast Region\nPacific Region\nSoutheast Region\nSouthern Region\nWestern Region\n\nCreating These Quarterly Summaries\nNOAA\u2019s Regional Climate Services lead the production of these quarterly summaries of climate impacts and outlooks for various regions of the United States as well as parts of Canada along the border.

High level findings (download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\nSeptember temperature anomalies in the U.S. were elevated across much of the country: 171 out of 191 analyzed cities were warmer than normal. The highest anomalies were in the Midwest and northern Great Plains (Figure 1).\n\n\nThis was the hottest September on record in 12 cities \u2013 including Denver, Minneapolis, and Phoenix \u2013 and was in the top 5 hottest Septembers for an additional 26 cities.\n\n\nThe Northern Rockies and Plains, as well as the Upper Midwest showed particularly elevated September temperatures. Average temperatures across the Northern Rockies and Plains were 5.4 \u00b0F higher than normal, and 4.3 \u00b0F in the Upper Midwest.\n\n\nClimate Shift Index (CSI) values meanwhile followed a different trend: Southwest and Florida cities stood out, experiencing the highest number of days with climate change-influenced temperatures at or above CSI 3 (temperatures made at least 3x more likely because of climate change).\n\n\nOn average, cities analyzed in the Southwest experienced at least 10 days with temperatures resulting in CSI values greater than or equal to 3. With the exception of the Southeast (with an average of 6 days), this was more than double the number of CSI 3 days experienced on average by cities in any other region.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Threaded ACIS temperature anomalies for September 2024\u00a0 relative to the 1991-2020 standard normal period. Analysis based on ERA5 data (September 1-26) and GFS data (September 27-30).\n\nFigure 2. Days with a CSI of 3 or higher for September 2024 for ACIS threaded stations.\n2. Local temperature anomaly analysis\u00a0(download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\nThe most unusually hot city in September was Rapid City, South Dakota, where it was 8.70\u00b0F hotter than normal. Septembers in Rapid City have warmed 4.2\u00b0F on average since 1970.\n\n\nBismarck, North Dakota, stood out as the 3rd most unusually warm city (with a temperature anomaly of 7.63\u00b0F), and as the city with the 7th strongest warming trend since 1970 (an average September today is 6.7\u00b0F warmer on average than in 1970)\n\n\n14 cities had September temperature anomalies greater than 5\u00b0F. These were in Montana (3 cities), Colorado (2), North Dakota (2), Minnesota (2), South Dakota (2), Arizona (1), Michigan (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (1).\n\n\n189 out of 191 ACIS stations analyzed had positive temperature trends for September, indicating that these cities have been warming on average since 1970.\n\n\nReno, NV had a moderately warm September (with an average daily temperature anomaly of 1.16\u00b0F), and is the fastest-warming ACIS station for September on average, warming 10.6 \u00b0F on average since 1970.\n\n\n3. Local Climate Shift Index analysis (download local data, including monthly precipitation)\n\n\n19 out of 191 ACIS stations analyzed had at least one week with daily CSI values greater than or equal to 3, indicating that temperatures on those days were made at least three times as likely due to climate change in those cities.\n\n\nSan Juan, Puerto Rico had 30 days at CSI 5, indicating that temperatures on these days were made at least 5 times more likely to occur because of climate change.\n\n\n5 out of the top 10 cities with the strongest climate signal were in Florida (Miami, West Palm Beach, Fort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa). Additionally, each of these cities had at least 9 days of temperatures with CSI values of 5.\n\n\nOn average, cities analyzed in the Southwest experienced at least 10 days with temperatures resulting in CSI values greater than or equal to 3. With the exception of the Southeast (with an average of 6 days), this was more than double the number of CSI 3 days experienced on average by cities in any other region.\n\n\nMethods\nCalculating the Climate Shift Index\nAll Climate Shift Index (CSI) levels reported in this brief are based on daily average temperatures and\u00a0 ERA5 data from September 1 to September 26, 2024, and GFS data from September 27 to September 30, 2024. See the frequently asked questions for details on computing the Climate Shift Index, including a summary of the multi-model approach described in Gilford et al. (2022).\nCity Analysis\nWe analyzed 191 Applied Climate Information System (ACIS) stations associated with U.S. cities. For each city, we found the CSI time series from the nearest 0.25\u00b0 grid cell. We calculated the number of days at CSI levels 2, 3, 4, and 5. We used ACIS data to find the average monthly temperatures, temperature anomalies, and precipitation information, and to derive average monthly warming trends for each city.\nClick here for more information about the Climate Shift Index\nMajor funding provided by the Bezos Earth Fund and The Schmidt Family Foundation.\nCustom email signup\nGet updates, media alerts, and climate reporting resources\nSign up\nSupport our work\nThere are lots of ways to help fund Climate Central today\nLearn more\n\n\nContact Us\n\nCareers\n\n\nGive now\n\n\nWays to give\n\n\nFinancials\n\n\nFunders\n\n\nInstagram\n\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Climate Central\n\nTerms of use\nPrivacy policy\nEditorial independence\n\n",

(DTN) -- A pair of new names joined two familiar ones amongst the list of wheat growers earning the title of \"Bin Buster\" in the 2024 National Wheat Yield Contest. On Monday, the National Wheat Foundation (NWF) announced this year's 26 national and 94 state winners, including those who topped the contest's four main categories.\nPhillip Gross of Warden, Washington, bested all contestants in 2024 and earned Bin Buster honors with his irrigated hard red winter wheat entry that yielded 223.08 bushels per acre (bpa). It's the second-highest yield recorded in the contest's nine-year history and Gross' fifth time atop the category.\nThe dryland winter wheat Bin Buster was Steve VanGrunsven of Forest Grove, Oregon, who earned the title for the second time with soft white winter wheat that averaged 170.63 bpa. Jess Blatchford of Baker City, Oregon, was named Bin Buster for the first time with irrigated soft white spring wheat yielding 174.74 bpa; while Nick Pfaff of Bismarck, North Dakota, also a first-time Bin Buster, took the dryland spring wheat category with an entry of 117.60 bpa.\nThe NWF yield contest is designed to encourage wheat growers to strive for high yield, quality and profit while trying new and innovative management strategies. DTN/Progressive Farmer is the official media outlet of the competition.\nThe overall contest record was set in 2022 by Rylee Reynolds of Castleford, Idaho, who produced 231.37 bpa of irrigated soft white winter wheat.\nAdditional national awards were presented to dryland wheat growers who raised a crop that excelled when compared to others in the county where it was produced. Entries are judged based on their percentage above their five-year Olympic county average, a figure published annually by USDA. This levels the playing field and provides a means of recognizing growers who succeed at producing wheat in lower-yielding areas.\nThis year, David Ebers of Wellston, Oklahoma, produced dryland hard red winter wheat that yielded 136.42 bpa -- 350.52% above his county average of 30.28 bpa. In Richardton, North Dakota, Greg Messer raised dryland hard red spring wheat that yielded 106.65 bpa, which was 166.49% above his county average of 40.02 bpa.\nNWF also tested out a new category, Digital Yield, as part of this year's contest. Open to dryland spring wheat growers in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota, this pilot category allowed growers to use technologies such as John Deere Operations Center, Climate FieldView or Bushel -- along with data from their calibrated grain cart scales -- to submit their yield into the contest from a 20-acre selected area from a previously entered field. By comparison, the four main categories require that contestants harvest and report at least 1.5 contiguous acres.\nBrad Disrud of Rolla, North Dakota, won this new category with a hard red spring wheat that yielded 102 bpa across 20 acres. John Hofer of Milnor, North Dakota, earned the digital yield award for highest percentage above county average with a yield of 98 bpa, which was 61.98% above his county average of 60.5 bpa.\n\"We are pleased with how the pilot digital yield category went and how much we can learn from it,\" said Anne Osborne, NWF project manager for the contest. \"We expect to continue this type of category and will take time this winter to gather feedback from the participants and our partners who helped us develop this category to refine it even more.\"\nBoth spring and winter wheat growers faced their share of weather challenges while producing this year's crop. DTN Ag Meteorologist John Baranick noted extensive drought was ongoing to start the planting season for winter wheat last fall in the Central and Southern Plains -- but only in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, southern Oklahoma and Texas. The majority of the soft red winter wheat areas were in much better shape, though they did get dry for a few weeks during the early growing period.\n\"There was a nice burst of precipitation in October 2023 with a strong storm system that went through, otherwise the fall was rather dry,\" Baranick said. \"The winter was not. It was a very active period through most of the middle of the country and Pacific Northwest, especially in January.\n\"While the Northern Plains didn't end up with a lot of snow, they did get decent enough moisture as soils rarely froze and frost lines were very shallow,\" he added. \"The good precipitation either reduced or eliminated drought for most all wheat-growing territories, bringing in some good soil moisture and making it available as spring started early with warm temperatures in February and March.\"\nThough temperatures were generally above normal in April and May, Baranick said there were a couple of cold snaps that brought some frost damage in hard red winter wheat areas and some northern soft red winter ones.\n\"The pattern stayed active in spring, though it was patchy,\" he said. \"Some areas of drought came and went, but by the beginning of May, almost none of the wheat territory in the country had drought.\"\nThe exception, he noted, was central and western Kansas, a region that just seemed to miss out on most of the rainfall while kernels were filling. The weather improved in June, but by that point, it was too late.\n\"And the severe weather that was now very active became more of a hindrance,\" Baranick concluded. \"In contrast, spring wheat areas in the Northern Plains and even much of the Pacific Northwest continued to have largely favorable weather into the summer. Drought stayed low until the crop was starting to undergo harvest when the pattern turned hotter and drier.\"\nThanks to the combination of a mostly conducive growing season and the creation of a new website, interest in the contest soared in 2024. Osborne said total entries reached a record 516 this year, eclipsing the contest's all-time high set in 2020 by nearly 100 entries.\n\"The new website, along with all our great partners promoting the contest, created more interest and enthusiasm for the contest,\" said Bernard Peterson, NWF chairman and farmer from Bardstown, Kentucky. \"We appreciate all the growers who participated and our partners who supported the contest. Congratulations to all the winners and to everyone who is learning how to raise higher yield and quality wheat through their experiences in the contest.\"\nIn total, 94 state yield contest winners were named from 29 states. Their yield average across all categories was 133.09 bpa, up from 127 bpa in 2023. The 24 national winners in the contest's four traditional categories hail from 11 states. Their entries' yield average was 145.05 bpa, an increase from 144 bpa last year.\nThough contest winners are selected based on yield, emphasis is also placed on the production of high-quality grain. The 26 national winners are required to submit a 10-pound sample that will be analyzed for milling and baking qualities. The soft wheat samples will be tested at the Wheat Marketing Center in Portland, Oregon; the hard wheat samples will be sent to the Great Plains Analytical Laboratory in Kansas City, Missouri. A panel of experts will rank the wheat samples by quality, and the winners will be announced in mid-January.\nNational winners are awarded a trip to the Commodity Classic, which will be held in March 2025 in Denver where they will be recognized at the NWF Winner's Reception on March 2, 2025.\nPartnering sponsors for the 2024 National Wheat Yield Contest included WestBred, John Deere, U.S. Wheat Associates, BASF, Croplan, Eastman, Limagrain Cereal Seeds, The McGregor Companies, AgriMAXX, Ardent Mills, Bushel, Climate FieldView, Corteva, DynaGro, GrainSense, Kentucky Small Grain Growers Association, Mennel, North Carolina Small Grain Growers Association, Ohio Corn & Wheat, PlainsGold, Siemer Milling Company, UPL, UniSouth Genetics, Grain Craft, Kansas Wheat, Miller Milling, Michigan Wheat, Montana Grain Growers Association, Northern Crops Institute and North Dakota Mill & Elevator.\nVisit www.dtnpf.com in the coming weeks for profiles of this year's \"Bin Buster\" award winners.\n**\n2024 NATIONAL WINNERS\nWINTER WHEAT DRYLAND CATEGORY WINNERS:\n-- Bin Buster: Steve VanGrunsven\nForest Grove, Oregon\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Shine\nYield: 170.63 bpa\n-- First Place: Jeffery Krohn\nOwendale, Michigan\nVariety: DF Seeds 271\nYield: 170.10 bpa\n-- Second Place: Clint Zenner\nGenesee, Idaho\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Shine\nYield: 167.03 bpa\n-- Third Place: Garrett Warren\nDayton, Washington\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds 50% Shine/50% Jefe\nYield: 164.68 bpa\n-- Fourth Place: Scott Truszkowski\nStewartsville, New Jersey\nVariety: Dyna-Gro 9070\nYield: 152.33 bpa\n-- Fifth Place: Mark Deysher\n\n                    More Recommended for You\n                \n\n                    Recommended for You\n                \nBath, Pennsylvania\nVariety: Seedway SW65\nYield: 152.32 bpa\n**\nWINTER WHEAT DRYLAND ABOVE COUNTY AVERAGE WINNERS:\n-- First Place: David Ebers\nWellston, Oklahoma\nVariety: WestBred WB4422\nYield: 136.42 bpa, 350.52% above Lincoln County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Second Place: Koby Dickerson\nVernon, Texas\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Steel AX\nYield: 102.80 bpa, 305.69% above Wilbarger County, Texas, average\n-- Third Place: Tom Hill\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Warbird AX\nYield: 135.64 bpa, 282.72% above Kay County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Fourth Place: Dylan Lindsey\nLamont, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Atomic AX\nYield: 130.05 bpa, 270.51% over Grant County, Oklahoma, average\n-- Fifth Place: Cheryl Lindsey\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: PlainsGold Kivari AX\nYield: 130.32 bpa, 267.71% above Kay County, Oklahoma, average\n**\nWINTER WHEAT IRRIGATED CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Phillip Gross\nWarden, Washington\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Jet\nYield: 223.08 bpa\n-- First Place: Oree Reynolds\nCastleford, Idaho\nVariety: WestBred WB1621\nYield: 220.81 bpa\n-- Second Place: Zach Balahtsis\nTonkawa, Oklahoma\nVariety: Limagrain Cereal Seeds Warbird AX\nYield: 177.52 bpa\n**\nSPRING WHEAT DRYLAND CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Nick Pfaff\nBismarck, North Dakota\nVariety: Croplan 3099A\nYield: 117.60 bpa\n-- First Place: John Wesolowski\nWarren, Minnesota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 114.93 bpa\n-- Second Place: Dale Flikkema\nBozeman, Montana\nVariety: WestBred WB9668\nYield: 113.74 bpa\n-- Third Place: Bruce & Helle Ruddenklau\nAmity, Oregon\nVariety: WestBred WB9668\nYield: 106.95 bpa\n**\nSPRING WHEAT DRYLAND ABOVE COUNTY AVERAGE WINNERS:\n-- First Place: Greg Messer\nRichardton, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 106.65 bpa, 166.49% above Stark County, North Dakota, average\n-- Second Place: Austin Kautzman\nMott, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 90.13 bpa, 147.01% above Grant County, North Dakota, average\n-- Third Place: Jordan Christman\nHettinger, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 87.36 bpa, 137.40% above Adams County, North Dakota, average\n**\nSPRING WHEAT IRRIGATED CATEGORY:\n-- Bin Buster: Jess Blatchford\nBaker City, Oregon\nVariety: WestBred WB6341\nYield: 174.74 bpa\n-- First Place: Dallin Wilcox\nRexburg, Idaho\nVariety: WestBred WB7589\nYield: 169.94 bpa\n-- Second Place: Joel Zwainz\nReardan, Washington\nVariety: WSU Tekoa\nYield: 165.35 bpa\n**\nPILOT DIGITAL YIELD - SPRING WHEAT DRYLAND\n-- High Yield: Brad Disrud\nRolla, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 102.00 bpa\n-- High Above County Yield: John Hofer\nMilnor, North Dakota\nVariety: WestBred WB9590\nYield: 98.00 bpa, 61.98% above Ranson County, North Dakota, average\n**\nFor more information on the yield contest and to view past winners, go to: https://www.wheatcontest.org/\u2026.\nJason Jenkins can be reached at jason.jenkins@dtn.com\nFollow him on social platform X @JasonJenkinsDTN\n(c) Copyright 2024 DTN, LLC.

      "Millions of kids are skipping school. Could the answer be recess \u2014 or giving them cash?\nMEDFORD, Mass. (AP) \u2014 Flerentin \u201cFlex\u201d Jean-Baptiste missed so much school he had to repeat his freshman year at Medford High outside Boston. At school, \u201cyou do the same thing every day,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste, who was absent 30 days his first year. \u201cThat gets very frustrating.\u201d\nThen his principal did something nearly unheard of: She let students play organized sports during lunch \u2014 if they attended all their classes. In other words, she offered high schoolers recess.\n\u201cIt gave me something to look forward to,\u201d said Jean-Baptiste, 16. The following year, he cut his absences in half. Schoolwide, the share of chronically absent students declined from 35% in March 2023 to 23% in March 2024 \u2014 one of the steepest declines among Massachusetts high schools.\nYears after COVID-19 upended American schooling, nearly every state is\u00a0still struggling with attendance, according to data collected by The Associated Press and Stanford University economist Thomas Dee.\nRoughly one in four students in the 2022-23 school year remained chronically absent, meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. That represents about 12 million children in the 42 states and Washington, D.C., where data is available.\nBefore the pandemic, only 15% of students missed that much school.\nSociety may have largely moved on from COVID, but schools say they\u2019re still battling the effects of\u00a0pandemic school closures. After as much as a year at home, school for many kids has felt overwhelming, boring or socially stressful. More than ever, kids and parents are deciding it\u2019s OK to stay home, which makes catching up even harder.\nIn all but one state, Arkansas, absence rates remain higher than they were pre-pandemic. Still, the problem appears to have passed its\u00a0peak; almost every state saw absenteeism improve at least slightly from 2021-22 to 2022-23.\nSchools are working to identify students with slipping attendance, then providing help. They\u2019re working to close communication gaps with parents, who often aren\u2019t aware their child is missing so much school or\u00a0why it\u2019s problematic.\nSo far, the solutions that appear to be helping are simple \u2014 like postcards to parents that compare a child\u2019s attendance with peers. But to make more progress, experts say, schools must get creative to address their students\u2019 needs.\nIn Oakland, California, chronic absenteeism skyrocketed from 29% pre-pandemic to 53% in 2022-23 across district and charter schools. Officials asked students what would convince them to come to class.\nMoney, they replied, and a mentor.\nA grant-funded program launched in spring 2023 paid 45 students $50 weekly for perfect attendance. Students also checked in daily with an assigned adult and completed weekly mental health assessments.\nPaying students isn\u2019t a permanent or sustainable fix, said Zaia Vera, the district\u2019s head of social-emotional learning.\nBut many absent students\u00a0lacked stable housing\u00a0or were helping to support their families. \u201cThe money is the hook that got them in the door,\u201d Vera said.\nMore than 60% improved their attendance after taking part, Vera said. The program is expected to continue, along with district-wide efforts aimed at creating a sense of belonging. Oakland\u2019s African American Male Achievement project, for example, pairs Black students with Black teachers who offer support.\nKids\u00a0who identify with their educators\u00a0are more likely to attend school, said Michael Gottfried, a University of Pennsylvania professor. According to\u00a0one study led by Gottfried,\u00a0California students felt \u201cit\u2019s important for me to see someone who\u2019s like me early on, first thing in the day,\u201d he said.\nA caring teacher made a difference for Golden Tachiquin, 18, who graduated from Oakland\u2019s Skyline High School this spring. When she started 10th grade after a remote freshman year, she felt lost and anxious. She later realized these feelings caused the nausea and dizziness that kept her home sick. She was absent at least 25 days that year.\nBut she bonded with an Afro-Latina teacher who understood her culturally and made Tachiquin, a straight-A student, feel her poor attendance didn\u2019t define her.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t dread going to her class,\u201d Tachiquin said.\nAnother teacher had\u00a0the opposite effect. \u201cShe would say, \u2018Wow, guess who decided to come today?\u2019 \u201d Tachiquin recalled. \u201cI started skipping her class even more.\u201d\nIn Massachusetts, Medford High School requires administrators to greet and talk with students each morning, especially those with a history of missing school.\nBut the lunchtime gym sessions have been the biggest driver of improved attendance, Principal Marta Cabral said. High schoolers need freedom and an opportunity to move their bodies, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re here for seven hours a day. They should have a little fun.\u201d\nChronically absent students are at higher risk of\u00a0illiteracy\u00a0and eventually\u00a0dropping out. They also miss the meals,\u00a0counseling\u00a0and socialization provided at school.\nMany of the reasons kids missed school early in the pandemic are still firmly in place:\u00a0financial hardship,\u00a0transportation\u00a0problems,\u00a0mild illness\u00a0and\u00a0mental health\u00a0struggles.\nIn Alaska, 45% of students missed significant school last year. In Amy Lloyd\u2019s high school classes in Juneau, some families now treat attendance as optional. Last term, several of her English students missed school for vacations.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know how to reset the expectation that was crushed when we sat in front of the computer for that year,\u201d Lloyd said.\nEmotional and behavioral problems also have kept kids home from school. Research\u00a0shared exclusively with AP\u00a0found absenteeism and poor mental health are \u201cinterconnected,\u201d said University of Southern California professor Morgan Polikoff.\nFor example, in the USC study, almost a quarter of chronically absent kids had high levels of emotional or behavioral problems, according to a parent questionnaire, compared with just 7% of kids with good attendance.\u00a0Emotional symptoms among teen girls\u00a0were especially linked with missing school.\nWhen chronic absence surged to around 50% in Fresno, California, officials realized they had to remedy pandemic-era mindsets about\u00a0keeping kids home sick.\n\u201cUnless your student has a fever or threw up in the last 24 hours, you are coming to school. That\u2019s what we want,\u201d said Abigail Arii, director of student support services.\nOften, said Noreida Perez, who oversees attendance, parents aren\u2019t aware physical symptoms can point to mental health struggles \u2014 such as when a child doesn\u2019t feel up to leaving their bedroom.\nMore than a dozen states now let students take mental health days as excused absences. But staying home can become a vicious cycle, said Hedy Chang, of Attendance Works, which works with schools on absenteeism.\n\u201cIf you continue to stay home from school, you feel more disengaged,\u201d she said. \u201cYou get farther behind.\u201d\nChanging the culture around sick days is only part of the problem.\nAt Fresno\u2019s Fort Miller Middle School, where half the students were chronically absent, two reasons kept coming up: dirty laundry and no transportation. The school bought a washer and dryer for families\u2019 use, along with a Chevy Suburban to pick up students who missed the bus. Overall, Fresno\u2019s chronic absenteeism improved to 35% in 2022-23.\nMelinda Gonzalez, 14, missed the school bus about once a week and would call for rides in the Suburban.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a car; my parents couldn\u2019t drive me to school,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cGetting that ride made a big difference.\u201d\n___\nBecky Bohrer contributed reporting from Juneau, Alaska.\nLatest in Features\nA little-known startup is acquiring enormous diamonds\u2014and using blockchain tech to shake up a $100 billion industry\nOn 2024\u2019s 100 Fastest-Growing Companies list, Tesla slides, Nvidia soars, and energy companies dominate\nBoeing may put its iconic space business up for sale and had talks with Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin, report says\nWhy international experience is the secret to becoming a CEO on the Fortune 500 Europe\nShell slips from the Fortune 500 Europe list\u2019s top spot, lending its crown to troubled Volkswagen\nBill Gates quietly donated $50 million to back Kamala Harris\u2014and it comes as Trump appears to be catching up in polls\nMost Popular\nCathie Wood says Elon Musk will succeed in his audit of the federal government because he has \u2018more proprietary data\u2019 than anyone\n50 million people have stopped buying luxury brands like Dior and Burberry after \u2018broken promises\u2019 to customers\nDetroit nonprofit CFO admits to stealing $44 million in decades-long scheme\u2014spent money on limos, travel, and clothes\nTom Brady calls out a problem with modern parenting: \u2018Every time they mess up, we send them to an easier place to succeed\u2019\nTech millionaire who spends $2 million a year to live forever looks unrecognizable after anti-aging procedure\nTurns out finance bros, HR managers and entrepreneurs are exactly what you think they are, researchers find\n\u00a9 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Dackin last week announced the release of the 2024 Ohio School Report Cards and Summary of Ohio School Report Cards. The report cards showcase the achievements of districts and schools, highlighting their efforts to prepare students for the future.\n\r\nDistricts and schools receive overall ratings of 1-5 stars in half-star increments. This year, nearly 90% of districts earned overall ratings of three stars or higher\u200b, meaning they met state expectations for performance. Overall graduation rates are the highest they have been in more than a decade, with 87.9% of the 2023 student cohort graduating within four years and 89.1% of the 2022 student cohort graduating within five years.\n\r\nKey points from this year\u2019s report cards include the following:\r\n\nGovernor DeWine\u2019s ReadOhio initiative aims to boost literacy achievement, ensuring every child reads at or above grade level.\r\n\tIt\u2019s important to acknowledge the gains in literacy scores for third, fourth, and fifth grade students, but also recognize there is significant improvement still needed. This year, 64.5% of third grade students are reading at or above grade level, an improvement from 62.3% last year. Ohio students are counting on us, and our work remains urgent.\u00a0\nMath proficiency has improved incrementally including gains in grades 4-7 and algebra, but only 53.5% of all students are proficient in math. The emphasis on learning supports and accelerating opportunities in mathematics remains critical to continuous improvement.\nOhio schools are leveraging partnerships to ensure students\u2019 wellness needs are being met. While chronic absenteeism has declined from 26.8% in the 2022-2023 school year to 25.6% in the 2023-2024 school year, it remains a challenge. It\u2019s more important than ever to keep students engaged in their learning and ensure families understand the importance of daily attendance.\nThe focus on creating valuable workforce experiences continues, equipping more students with practical skills for high-wage, in-demand careers. Although not included in the ratings, more than half of the Class of 2023 met at least one of the College, Career, Workforce, and Military Readiness Component measures demonstrating their preparedness for postsecondary education, the workforce, or the military.\n\r\nAdditional report card resources, including the 2024 report card guides, are available on the Department\u2019s Report Card Resources webpage. The report card guides provide an overview and explanation of the key components of each type of report card.\n\r\nTo view your school or district report card, visit: reportcard.education.ohio.gov\nUnderstanding Report Card Data: Virtual Appointments available\r\nDepartment team members are providing individual virtual work sessions to help school and district staff understand component calculations, data insights, and how to use data to drive school improvement.\n\r\nSign up for a report card work session. Questions may also be sent to accountability@education.ohio.gov.\n\r\nThe Ohio Department of Education and Workforce is committed to providing access and inclusion and reasonable accommodation in its services, activities, programs, and employment opportunities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other applicable laws.

What troubles some educators?\nNovember 19, 2024\nOctober 8, 2024\nElection 2024: How voters can help repair California schools\nView Now \nAugust 28, 2024\nGetting students back to school: Addressing chronic absenteeism\nView Now \nNews Topics\nFeatured Special Reports\nKindly Log In\nTesting and Accountability\nStatewide test scores improved in 2024, but achievement still not back to pre-Covid levels\nCalifornia students made some progress toward regaining their pre-Covid levels of achievement with incremental increases in English language arts, math and science scores last school year, according to state data released Wednesday.\nEnglish language arts test scores overall increased slightly, from 46.7% of the state\u2019s students meeting or exceeding proficiency standards in 2023 to 47% in 2024. Math and science scores also edged up incrementally, with 30.7% of students in both subjects meeting or exceeding proficiency standards compared with 30.2% the year before.\u00a0\nSmarter Balanced tests are given to students in third through eighth grades and in 11th grade. They are part of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress (CAASPP), which also includes the English Language Proficiency Assessment.\nLast school year was the third year students returned to school since the Covid pandemic pushed schools into distance learning and caused dramatic declines in test scores after years of progress. In 2019, more than half of California students, 51.7%, met or exceeded state standards in English language arts, and 37.1% met or exceeded state standards in math.\nLinda Darling-Hammond, president of the State Board of Education and an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom, said she found reason for encouragement in the scores. She said that the overall gains were consistent across grades and for Latino and Black students.\n\u00a0\u201cCalifornia\u2019s public schools are making encouraging gains in all of the key subject areas, and these gains are largest for our most vulnerable groups of students,\u201d Darling-Hammond said in a statement. \u201cOur governor and the Legislature have, in recent years, prioritized \u2026 accelerating learning and equity: community schools, expanded learning time, transitional kindergarten, and investments in literacy and math. Those efforts are paying dividends.\u201d\u00a0\nStudents from low-income households made larger gains in all three subjects on the tests than students overall \u2014 a change from initially after the pandemic. Low-income students\u2019 scores in English language arts increased 1.5 percentage points over the previous year, with 36.8% meeting or exceeding proficiency standards in English. There was a similar increase in both math and science, with 20.7% meeting or exceeding standards \u2014 a 1.4 percentage point increase in each.\nDarling-Hammond attributes the academic improvement to billions of dollars in federal and state assistance directed to students with the most needs. She acknowledged it\u2019s not possible to tease out the impact of the state\u2019s expanded after-school learning program relative to money spent on community schools or literacy coaches. But it\u2019s apparent that the combined money is making a difference; for families experiencing evictions and illnesses in high-poverty neighborhoods, the pandemic isn\u2019t over, she said.\u00a0\n\u201cMy heart goes out to those in the schools that deal daily with these issues,\u201d Darling-Hammond said.\nThis narrowing of the performance gaps occurred even though the proportion of low-income students in California has grown significantly in the last seven years, from 58% to 65%, Darling-Hammond said. And the numbers of homeless and foster children are up too, she said.\nAfter looking at the same state data, however, the nonprofit advocacy group Children Now expressed alarm. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s lack of progress in closing the education achievement gap over the past 10 years is completely unacceptable,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe have made almost no progress for our Black and Latino students, who make up more than 60% of California\u2019s TK-12 student population, since the start of the Local Control Funding Formula and associated accountability system a decade ago.\u201d\nAdditional protections are needed, Children Now stated, \u201cto ensure the equity-focused funding that is the hallmark (of the funding formula) goes to the schools and students most in need to close our state\u2019s unconscionable achievement gap.\u201d\nEnglish and math scores for students in all California schools and districts showing gaps in proficiency.\nCalifornia school districts have received record levels of one-time and ongoing funding since the start of the Covid pandemic. But the last $12.5 billion in federal pandemic relief \u2014 20% of which was required to be spent on learning recovery \u2014\u00a0had to be spent by last month.\nCalifornia schools are getting creative to continue to fund positions and other support once funded by Covid dollars, said Alex Traverso, spokesperson for the California State Board of Education. Some schools in San Diego County, for example, are funding counselors and social worker positions, once paid for with federal Covid dollars, with the community schools dollars.\n\u201cSo I think as much as we can, we are trying to find strategies and techniques that can keep these programs moving forward and keep student achievement on the rise,\u201d Traverso said.\nThe gap in proficiency between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged students remains daunting in 2023-24: 29.3 percentage points in English language arts and 30.2 percentage points in math \u2014 about 1 percentage point smaller than in 2022-23.\nStates\u2019 scores flat after dropping\nAn analysis of third-grade reading by David Scarlett Wakelyn, a partner with Upswing Labs, a nonprofit that works with school districts to improve reading instruction, found that California\u2019s scores were similar to 29 other states he has examined: flat after falling sharply after the pandemic.\nThird grade is a benchmark year for achieving fluency. In 2018-19, the last year before the pandemic, 48.5% of California students were proficient or advanced; in 2023-24, 42.8% were, a drop of 5.7 percentage points. In the past three years, reading scores rose less than 1 percentage point.\nOther states that take the Smarter Balanced assessments followed the same pattern, including Oregon, Nevada and Delaware, whose scores were below California before the pandemic and were again in 2023-24. Washington State, where 55% of students were proficient in 2018-19, fell to 47% and has stayed there the past three years.\u00a0\u00a0\nNone of the nation\u2019s 10 largest states have bounced back to where they were before the pandemic, Wakelyn found. But in four \u201cbright spot\u201d states \u2014 Mississippi, West Virginia, Louisiana and South Carolina \u2014 reading scores increased by 3 to 5 percentage points each of the past three years and are now ahead of where they were before the pandemic. The state leadership in Louisiana, he said, has long focused on adopting high-quality instructional materials and giving teachers deep professional learning opportunities in the new curricula, he said.\u00a0\u00a0\nSmarter Balanced test results divide student scores into four achievement levels, but this year the names of the levels have changed. Instead of \u201cnot meeting standards,\u201d \u201cstandards nearly met,\u201d \u201cstandards met\u201d or \u201cstandards exceeded,\u201d\u00a0they are now \u201cadvanced,\u201d \u201cproficient,\u201d \u201cfoundational\u201d or \u201cinconsistent.\u201d\u00a0\nEnglish learners have mixed results\nFewer English learners tested as proficient on the summative English Language Proficiency Assessment for California (ELPAC) than last year. The percentage of English learners who tested as proficient went down from 16.5% in 2023 to 14.6% in 2024, while the percentage of English learners who had the most basic level of English increased from 20.33% to 23.93%.\nStudents classified as English learners have to take the summative ELPAC every year until they achieve proficiency. There are four levels of proficiency \u2014 \u201cbeginning to develop,\u201d \u201csomewhat developed,\u201d \u201cmoderately developed,\u201d and \u201cwell developed.\u201d\nShelly Spiegel-Coleman, strategic adviser to the Californians Together, a nonprofit organization that advocates for English learners, said it is difficult to know what these numbers mean, because they could be due to a change in the demographics of English learners. For example, the increase in the percentage of students with the most basic level of English could be due to an increase in students who recently arrived in the U.S., she said. In addition, there is no information about how many students are reclassified as proficient in English.\nHowever, she said, \u201cit would suggest that districts take a look at their English language development program and see if there is a need for intentional work to enhance it.\u201d\nRelated Reading\nOctober 10, 2024\nLos Angeles, Compton see gains\nThe number of students in Los Angeles Unified (LAUSD) who met or exceeded state proficiency standards in both English language arts and math increased by about 2 points since 2023. Now, 43% of students meet or exceed standards in English language arts and 32.83% of students meet or exceed standards in math.\nSchool board member Kelly Gonez said the district is committed to continuous improvement and equity.\n\u201cEvery day, we\u2019re showing up for our students, and it\u2019s showing results,\u201d Gonez said at a news conference in July, when the district announced preliminary scores. \u201cI believe that we\u2019re at the tipping point of really achieving the ambitious goals that we have for our students in our school district.\u201d\nNearby Compton Unified also saw improved test scores last school year. Roughly 43% of students met or exceeded proficiency standards in English language arts this year, compared with about 40% the previous year. The number of students who met or exceeded math standards also rose, from just over 31% to nearly 35% this year.\u00a0\n\u201cCompton Unified School District has shown steady and remarkable progress in both math and English language arts, with our CAASPP scores far exceeding the state average for school districts with an unduplicated pupil count exceeding 90%,\u201d Compton Unified School District Superintendent Darin Brawley said in a statement to EdSource.\u00a0\nAlong with Compton and Los Angeles, the California Department of Education singled out Benicia Unified, Fallbrook Union Elementary and Santa Maria Joint Union High School districts for sharp gains in scores.\nBenecia\u2019s 8 point gain in math scores, to 53% proficiency, was led by two years of growth by Hispanic students. At 40.7% proficiency, they are the first student group in the district to exceed its pre-pandemic 2018-19 rate. Superintendent Damon Wright credited the funding of\u00a0districtwide professional learning and instructional coaches as factors. \u00a0\nFallbrook\u2019s one-year 5.2 point gain in English language arts and 5.9 pont gain in math bring the district almost back to pre-pandemic levels. Superintendent Monika Hazel also credits additional district-level\u00a0math teaching specialists, leadership coaches\u00a0and school-level instructional coaches for contributing to the improvement. The state\u2019s $6 billion Learning Recovery Emergency Block Grant, which will continue after federal Covid relief runs dry this fall, paid for some of the positions.\nBay Area schools\u2019 results vary\nIn the Bay Area, some districts had big test score gains, while others stayed stagnant. Benicia Unified had a 4-point gain in its overall English test score, and an 8-point gain in math. San Francisco and Oakland test scores were mostly stagnant.\nWest Contra Costa Unified is laboring to bring its scores back to pre-pandemic levels.\u00a0Since the 2021-22 school year, slightly more West Contra Costa students have tested proficient or higher in math \u2014 up 2 points to 23% this year. Students who meet or exceed state proficiency standards in English language arts have been flat since 2021 at 32%, compared with 34.9% pre-pandemic.\nTo help improve reading scores, the district created a 13-member literacy task force about a year ago to create a literacy plan and improve literacy instruction in the district. District officials did not respond to requests for an update on the task force\u2019s progress.\nBig gains for Central Valley migrant students\nTulare Joint Union High School District in the Central Valley region had data points worth celebrating and data pointing to areas that need improvement, said Kevin Covert, assistant superintendent for curriculum, technology and assessment of the test results.\u00a0\nBased on the 2024 tests, 53.5% of\u00a0the 1,300 11th graders who took the exam met or exceeded English proficiency standards, a 2.2 point gain from the previous year. In math, 18.3% of students met or exceeded standards \u2014 an improvement of less than 1 point.\u00a0\n\u201cSome people want to hang their hat on an overall test score,\u201d Covert said. \u201cWe\u2019re also looking at how our subgroups are doing.\u201d\nThe percentage of Tulare Joint Union students with disabilities meeting or exceeding standards was 12.7% in English, a jump of more than 5 points, and 3.5% in math, an improvement of more than 2 points. Though scores have fluctuated for students with disabilities, the 5.5-point gain in English is the largest percentage growth the group has made within the last decade. \nThough migrant students are a small population of the district\u2019s students, 63.6% met or exceeded English standards, representing a double-digit gain. Only 18.2% met or exceeded math standards, although the increase of 1.5% was higher than the overall district increase. \n\u201cOur success on this test can only be as good, partly, as the instruction that\u2019s going on in the classroom,\u201d Covert said. But educators must also know where students are academically, which is harder to track in Tulare Joint Union.\nFresno Unified, the state\u2019s third-largest district, is struggling to return to pre-pandemic levels of achievement of 38% proficiency and above in English language arts and 29% proficiency and advanced in math. Superintendent Misty Her expressed confidence in the districtwide strategy known as \u201cdata chats.\u201d At Data Chats, principals and staff evaluate data and set goals, including the need for intervention, for students to progress.\nYou can make a difference\nWe're kicking off our end-of-year campaign.

      "Numbers, Facts and Trends Shaping Your World\nRead our research on:\nFull Topic List\nRead Our Research On:\n|\nMost Americans think U.S. K-12 STEM education isn\u2019t above average, but test results paint a mixed picture\nMost Americans believe K-12 STEM education in the United States is either average or below average compared with other wealthy nations, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.\nRecent global standardized test scores show that students in the U.S. are, in fact, lagging behind their peers in other wealthy nations when it comes to math. But America\u2019s students are doing better than average in science compared with pupils in these other countries.\nPew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans\u2019 ratings of K-12 STEM education in the United States. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,133 U.S. adults from Feb. 7 to 11, 2024.\nEveryone who took part in the survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way, nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\nWe also analyzed the latest data from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), which tests 15-year-old students in math, reading and science in member and partner countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). This analysis only includes scores from students in the 37 OECD countries that took the 2022 PISA.\nJust 28% of U.S. adults say America is the best in the world or above average in K-12 science, technology, engineering and math education compared with other wealthy nations. A third say the U.S. is average, while another 32% think the U.S. is below average or the worst in K-12 STEM education.\nSome demographic groups are more pessimistic than others about the state of U.S. STEM education. White Americans (24%) are less likely than Black (31%), Hispanic (37%) or English-speaking Asian (43%) Americans to say U.S. K-12 STEM education is the best in the world or above average. And fewer women (25%) than men (32%) say K-12 STEM education is at least above average.\nRepublicans and Democrats give similar ratings to K-12 STEM education: 31% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say it is at least above average, as do 27% of Republicans and GOP leaners.\nAmericans\u2019 views today are similar to those in a 2019 telephone survey by the Center, which was conducted before the coronavirus pandemic caused major disruptions in the country\u2019s schools. In that survey, 31% of Americans said U.S. K-12 STEM education is the best in the world or above average compared with other nations.\nThe latest figures from the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) show a mixed picture in U.S. math and science scores.\nAs of 2022, the U.S. was below average in math but above average in science compared with other member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a group of mostly highly developed, democratic nations:\nPISA is taken by 15-year-old students about every three years. Students in 37 OECD countries took the 2022 PISA.\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, along with responses, and its methodology.\nTopics\nBrian Kennedy is a senior researcher\nfocusing on science and society research at Pew Research Center.\nRelated\nA quarter of U.S. teachers say AI tools do more harm than good in K-12 education\nAbout 1 in 4 U.S. teachers say their school went into a gun-related lockdown in the last school year\nAbout half of Americans say public K-12 education is going in the wrong direction\nWhat Public K-12 Teachers Want Americans To Know About Teaching\nWhat\u2019s It Like To Be a Teacher in America Today?\nTOPICS\nMost Popular\n1615 L St. NW, Suite 800Washington,\u00a0DC\u00a020036USA(+1) 202-419-4300\u00a0|\u00a0Main(+1) 202-857-8562\u00a0|\u00a0Fax(+1) 202-419-4372\u00a0|\u00a0Media Inquiries\nABOUT PEW RESEARCH CENTER\u00a0Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues, attitudes and trends shaping the world.
