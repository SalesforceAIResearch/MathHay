During the first 20 days of February, the state ran an average temperature of 41\u00b0F, an impressive 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record until February 21. The current 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures to continue into mid-March (Figure 1). The effects of these warmer-than-average temperatures on the wheat crop are concerning producers and crop consultants.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 1. The Climate Prediction Center's 8 to 14-day temperature outlook as of February 28, 2024. \n\u00a0\nHow warm have soil temperatures been?\nThe physiology of wheat vernalization and cold hardiness suggests that soil temperatures at the crown level rather than air temperatures should be the primary driver of increased or decreased cold hardiness during the winter. Soil temperatures will be influenced by tillage practice, the amount and type of residue on the soil surface, position on the landscape, and soil moisture. Soils with a thick residue layer on the surface often have lower temperatures than bare soils, as the residue blocks direct exposure to sunlight and reduces soil evaporation, generally conserving more moisture. Moist soils require more energy to cause any change in temperature than dry soils; thus, any increase or decrease in temperature occurs more slowly than in dry soils. As a result, moist soils with heavy residue will heat more slowly than dry bare soils.\nSoil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from around 39\u00b0F in the northwest portion of the state, to as high as 48\u00b0F in the southern portions of the state (Figure 2). The warmest soil temperatures were along the Oklahoma border in south-central counties.\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 2. Weekly 2-inch average soil temperatures across Kansas during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nDaily soil temperature variations varied with the amount of solar input and remaining grass cover. Some locations have briefly approached/reached the 58-61\u00b0F mark in recent afternoons (Figure 3). With temperatures running 15-20\u00b0F above normal, the soil temperatures are greatly reflecting these conditions.\n\n\nFigure 3. Maximum soil temperature at the 2-inch depth during the February 22-29, 2024 period. Data from the Kansas Mesonet at mesonet.ksu.edu/agriculture/soiltemp.\n\u00a0\nUnderstanding the vernalization process in winter wheat\nWinter hardiness or cold tolerance is a physiological process triggered by gradually cooling temperatures in the fall. During the process of cold acclimation, there is a reduction in moisture content in the cells of the crown, which slows growth processes and the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates, all of which protect the cell membranes from freeze damage.\nThe process of cold acclimation within a sufficiently developed wheat seedling begins when soil temperatures at crown depth fall below 49 degrees F. Below this threshold, there is an inverse relationship of cold acclimation as affected by crown temperatures; in other words, wheat plants will acclimate twice as fast when crown temperatures are 32\u00b0F as compared to 40\u00b0F. Photoperiod also plays a role in cold hardening, with shorter days and longer nights helping initiate the process. With good and timely stand establishment for most of Kansas, the fall conditions experienced during 2023 were favorable for winterhardiness development of the 2023-24 wheat crop. Winter survival depends on the crown remaining alive; the substances that produce cold acclimation are most needed within the crown.\nIt takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50 degrees at the depth of the crown for winter wheat to fully cold harden. The colder the soil at the depth of the crown, the more quickly the plants will develop winter hardiness.\nTemperature fluctuations during the winter and its effects on wheat cold hardiness\nCold hardiness is not a static state. After the cold hardening process begins in the fall, wheat plants can rapidly unharden when soil temperatures at the depth of the crown get above 49 degrees. But the plants will re-harden as crown temperatures cool below 49 degrees again. By the time winter begins, winter wheat will normally have reached its maximum level of cold hardiness. Wheat in Kansas normally has its maximum level of winter hardiness from mid-December to mid-January unless there are high temperatures during that period.\nOnce winter wheat has reached full cold hardiness, it will remain cold hardy as long as crown temperatures remain below about 32 degrees \u2013 assuming the plants had a good supply of energy going into the winter.\nIf soil temperatures at the crown depth rise to 50 degrees or more for a prolonged period, there will be a gradual loss of cold hardiness, even in the middle of winter. The warmer the crown temperature during the winter, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness. This is the situation being experienced during the 2023-24 wheat season since the many weeks of warm temperatures during early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average (Figure 4). Winter wheat can re-harden during the winter if it loses its full level of winterhardiness, but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness.\nAs soil temperatures at the crown level rise to 50 degrees or more, usually in late winter or spring, winter wheat will gradually lose its winter hardiness entirely. Photoperiod also plays a role in this process. When the leaves switch from prostrate to upright, the plants will completely de-harden.\r\n\u00a0\n\nFigure 4.

The warmer the crown temperature got during this recent period, the more quickly the plants will start losing their maximum level of cold hardiness.\nThe forecast indicates much above normal temperatures are likely to continue into mid-March. Winter wheat can re-harden to some extent during the winter, even if it loses its full level of winter hardiness but will not regain its maximum level of winter hardiness. Thus, in the regions where soil temperatures have been warmest, the crop may be less tolerant to low temperatures for the remainder of this winter, becoming more susceptible to freeze injury if temperatures decrease to single digits in the near future. Another potential consequence of warm winter temperatures is an overall accelerated crop development during the spring, leading to the early heading of the wheat crop. A primary potential consequence of an early heading is to position heading dates within a window when freeze occurrence in the spring is more likely. If a hard freeze (28-32\u00b0F) occurs during anthesis, the consequences can be very damaging to the crop\u2019s yield potential. However, a positive note in earlier heading is that grain filling also tends to occur earlier in the year, when hot temperatures are less likely. Cooler temperatures during grain filling can relate to increased grain yields as long as damaging frosts are avoided.\n\u00a0\nRomulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist\nlollato@ksu.edu\nChip Redmond, Weather Data Library\nchristopherredmond@ksu.edu\nTags:\u00a0\n                            wheat\u00a0warm temperatures\u00a0green-up\u00a0                        \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University\n",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Since late January, Kansas has experienced much warmer-than-average air temperatures. In the first 20 days of February, the state averaged 41\u00b0F, 8\u00b0F above normal, ranking 8th for warmest February on record. The 8 to 14-day outlook favors above-normal temperatures into mid-March. These warmer temperatures are concerning for wheat producers and crop consultants. Soil temperatures at the 2-inch depth ranged from 39\u00b0F in the northwest to 48\u00b0F in the southern parts of the state, with the warmest along the Oklahoma border. Some locations briefly reached 58-61\u00b0F in recent afternoons. Winter wheat's cold hardiness is influenced by soil temperatures at the crown level. Cold acclimation begins when soil temperatures fall below 49\u00b0F, with faster acclimation at lower temperatures. It takes about 4 to 6 weeks of soil temperatures below 50\u00b0F for winter wheat to fully cold harden. However, wheat can rapidly lose cold hardiness if crown temperatures rise above 49\u00b0F. This season, warm temperatures in early February have started to green up the crop ahead of the long-term average. The high soil temperatures in February could lead to a gradual loss of cold hardiness, especially in the southeast quarter of the state where temperatures were consistently close to 50\u00b0F. The forecast indicates above-normal temperatures into mid-March, which may result in less tolerance to low temperatures and increased susceptibility to freeze injury. Warm winter temperatures could also accelerate crop development, leading to early heading and potential freeze damage during anthesis. However, earlier grain filling could benefit yields if damaging frosts are avoided.Romulo Lollato, Wheat and Forages Specialist, and Chip Redmond, Weather Data Library, contributed to this assessment.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",

This study aims to determine the contribution of agronomic and input factors to the total carbon (C) footprint of rice production to identify solutions that can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in agriculture in this region.\nMethods\nWe used a life cycle assessment method for the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Agronomic parameters and input data in both spring and summer crops were collected through interviews conducted with 50 rice-farming households in the Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, using questionnaires. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather information on energy used for land preparation and harvesting.\nResults and discussion\nThe C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain of the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). GHG emissions were due mainly to direct methane emissions during rice growth, accounting for 89.5% of the total C footprint of the summer crop and 80.5% of that of the spring crop. Fertilizer emissions also contributed significantly, accounting for 5.4% and 10.4%, respectively, nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. A higher C footprint (per grain basis) was generally associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield, indicating the importance of agronomic management of crop residues, water and nutrients, choice of varieties, and growing seasons. Small farm size did not lead to higher carbon intensity.\nConclusions\nThe solutions to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, to conduct intermittent irrigation, to reduce the amount of N-fertilizer, and to use short-duration rice varieties (especially for summer crop) with high yield potential along with optimal agronomic management practices should be highlighted. Greater adoption of these measures will contribute significantly to reducing the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nA comparative study on carbon footprint of rice production between household and aggregated farms from Jiangxi, China\n                                        \n\n\nCarbon Footprint Reduction from Closing Rice Yield Gaps\n                                        \n\n\nEnergy and environmental impact analysis of rice cultivation and straw management in northern Thailand\n                                        \n\nExplore related subjects\nData availability\nThe datasets generated and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding authors on reasonable request.\nReferences\nAbid AA, Zhang Q, Adil MF, Batool I, Abbas M, Hassan Z, Khan AA, Castellano-Hinojosa A, Zaidi SHR, Di H, Abdeslsalam NR (2022) Nitrogen optimization coupled with alternate wetting and drying practice enhances rhizospheric nitrifier and denitrifier abundance and rice productivity.

Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risk and contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in vulnerable semi-arid districts of Odisha\u2014Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj. We use primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, using a multi-stage stratified sampling approach and structured questionnaire. Propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) have been used to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrument variables, namely distance to the extension office and percentage of adopters in a village, are used to control self-selection bias and endogeneity in our model. Both models show a positive and significant impact of the adoption of CSA on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The study sheds light on the significant contribution of CSA practices in fostering sustainable income growth amid environmental challenges. Overall, our results suggest that small and marginal farmers of Eastern India, a highly environmentally vulnerable area, can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Hence, policymakers should scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution\n\n\n to check access.\n                                \nAccess this article\nSubscribe and save\nBuy Now\nPrice excludes VAT (USA)\n     Tax calculation will be finalised during checkout.\nInstant access to the full article PDF.\nRent this article via DeepDyve\n\n\n\nInstitutional subscriptions \n    \n\n\nSimilar content being viewed by others\n\nDoes adoption of climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices improve farmers\u2019 crop income?

INR 100\u2009=\u2009US Dollar 1.2\n Over time, as the adoption of new technologies becomes routine, farmers become less dependent on government assistance. For instance, the government used high-yielding seeds and chemical fertilizers during the Green Revolution. Farmers adopted these practices with government support initially, and now, they independently utilize these inputs without relying on continuous government assistance. Similarly, the concept of CSA must be ingrained in the farming community. Once farmers accept and integrate CSA practices into their routines, they can carry them out independently. However, the state must provide support, especially for marginal farmers, who may need external assistance to adopt CSA practices.\nReferences\nAbegunde VO, Sibanda M, Obi A (2019) Determinants of the adoption of climate-smart agricultural practices by small-scale farming households in King Cetshwayo District Municipality, South Africa.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Purpose: Rice production in Northeastern Vietnam is crucial for livelihoods, especially in the northern mountainous and midlands region. This study aims to identify agronomic and input factors contributing to the carbon (C) footprint of rice production and propose solutions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.Methods: A life cycle assessment method was used to evaluate the C footprint of rice production from planting to harvesting. Data were collected from 50 rice-farming households in Quang Minh commune, Viet Yen district, Bac Giang province, through questionnaires and in-depth interviews.Results and Discussion: The C footprint per hectare and per tonne of grain for the summer rice crop (15.6\u2009\u00b1\u20093.3 t CO2-eq/ha, 2.34\u2009\u00b1\u20090.54 t CO2-eq/t) was significantly higher than that of the spring crop (9.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.8 t CO2-eq/ha, 1.3\u2009\u00b1\u20090.26 t CO2-eq/t). Methane emissions during rice growth were the main contributors, accounting for 89.5% of the summer crop's C footprint and 80.5% of the spring crop's. Fertilizer emissions also played a significant role, contributing 5.4% and 10.4% respectively, with nearly 75% from N-fertilizer emissions. Higher C footprints were associated with straw incorporation, continuous flooded irrigation, longer rice growth duration, and lower rice yield.Conclusions: To reduce the C footprint, it is recommended to avoid direct incorporation of rice straw, implement intermittent irrigation, reduce N-fertilizer use, and use short-duration rice varieties with high yield potential. These measures, along with optimal agronomic management practices, can significantly lower the C footprint of rice production in Northeastern Vietnam.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Climate-induced increases in temperature and rainfall variability pose significant threats to agriculture and food security in Odisha, India. Climate-smart agricultural (CSA) practices, such as crop rotation and integrated soil management, help farmers adapt to climate risks and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This study examines the impact of CSA practices on yield and income in the semi-arid districts of Balangir, Kendrapara, and Mayurbhanj in Odisha. Using primary survey data from 494 households collected in 2019\u20132020, the study employs propensity score matching (PSM) and the two-stage least square method (2SLS) to analyze the impact of CSA on income and productivity. Two instrumental variables\u2014distance to the extension office and the percentage of adopters in a village\u2014are used to control for self-selection bias and endogeneity. Both models show a positive and significant impact of CSA adoption on farmers\u2019 productivity and income. The results suggest that small and marginal farmers in Eastern India can significantly improve their income and productivity by adopting CSA technology. Policymakers are encouraged to scale the adoption of CSA technology through effective extension programs.",

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Document2": "The Maldives is racing to create new land. Why are so many people concerned?\nBy Jesse Chase-Lubitz\nPhotography by Neeta Satam for Nature\n24 April 2024\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.\nThis article is also available as a pdf version.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSun, sand and sea.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9\u00a0months ago, the government took away the sea.\nA state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130\u00a0metres\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations.\nThe view in front of Mohamed Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel on Addu Atoll.\nThe Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe sunny side of life\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100.\nIn an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space.\nMaldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis will be a doorstep, a job destination and an income-generating destination,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said President Mohamed Muizzu at the inauguration of a new land-reclamation project last December.\nCritics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCall me in five years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Shaiz says, gesturing to the newly created desert in front of his hotel. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis land will be the same.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nMohamed Shaiz and his family own a hotel on Addu Atoll.\nIn addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAtolls are extremely vulnerable ecosystems,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Bregje van Wesenbeeck, the scientific director of Deltares, a Dutch research institute for water management in Delft. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you start to interfere with them, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sort of failing them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nThe island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll.\nDutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800\u00a0years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350\u00a0square kilometres \u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than three times the size of Paris\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100\u00a0km2 in just 4\u00a0years, and 65\u00a0km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one\u00a0million people, 75%\u00a0had reclaimed land1.\nWith projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50\u00a0islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a conservative estimate.\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nSource: Maldives Land and Survey Authority\nLand scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s territory covers 90,000\u00a0km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300\u00a0km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3\u00a0million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00c3\u00a9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible to walk across the entire island in 20\u00a0minutes.\nImages captured by LANDSAT satellites in 1997 and 2020 show the impact of reclamation projects on Mal\u00c3\u00a9 and nearby islands.\nCredit: Lauren Dauphin/NASA Earth Observatory\nThe Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 1,200\u00a0islands are all atolls\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nHeaps of sand and debris are piled up next to Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel and behind the new patch of reclaimed land.\nAddu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00c3\u00a9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200\u00a0species of fish\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020.\nSome of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on.\nThe Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000\u00a0requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need land,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nA reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts.\nBecause Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this huge expansion project, the transformational development of Addu City has commenced,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said former president Ibrahim Mohamed Solih after inaugurating the project in June 2023.\nThe project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00c3\u00a9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore.\nMohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00c3\u00a9, to do the review.\nThe environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u00e2\u0080\u009d and that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u00e2\u0080\u009d. But it also concluded that \u00e2\u0080\u009clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u00e2\u0080\u009d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohamed says. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut they didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10\u00a0years at the agency.\nAfter the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nOnce the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 ranging from moderate to major\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities.\nThe assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340\u00a0million and $851\u00a0million.\nThe September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u00e2\u0080\u009cwould have an overall negative impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d, he says.\nWhen asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u00e2\u0080\u009cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says, adding that \u00e2\u0080\u009cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nIbrahim Mohamed previously worked for the Maldives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Environmental Protection Agency.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe construction company Van Oord is performing the reclamation work for the Addu Atoll project.\nThe Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u00e2\u0080\u009cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas.\nVan Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u00e2\u0080\u009call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nA new house on Hulhumeedhoo island, to the northeast of Addu City, remains unfinished and unoccupied.\nIn October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt can never be compensated properly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nToday, the land in front of Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nReefs at risk\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nReclamation projects in the Maldives can fill the water with sediment, threatening coral reefs.\nSitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon and the ocean. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is like a cemetery now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says.\nMusthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNisal Musthag leads diving trips in Addu, but has stopped taking tourists to spots where coral was damaged by reclamation projects.\nThe impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists.\nTo reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000\u00a0corals to 9\u00a0recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u00e2\u0080\u009ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\nSaleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe moved 80\u00a0colonies,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Rasheed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nAli Nizar, Addu City\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mayor, supports the island\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reclamation projects.\nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira, social-justice advocate in Addu. \nFathimath Saaira is a social-justice advocate in Addu who opposes the reclamation there.\nBut the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well.\nResearchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved2. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242\u00a0coral fragments 12\u00a0months after they had been moved3. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. \nA solitary mangrove tree grows near newly reclaimed land in northeast Addu.\nA grey heron joins others on a new sea wall built in Addu.\nBut coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, say scientists.\nWater Solutions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98\u00a0hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7\u00a0million a year.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nCoral debris makes up much of the reclaimed land.\nNot far from Shaiz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the changes wrought by reclamation\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers.\nLike other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 leaving a deficit in its wake\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nNot only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIslands can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t occur anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she says.\nA reclamation projection near Mal\u00c3\u00a9.\nThilafushi is an industrial island near Mal\u00c3\u00a9 that hosts one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s large rubbish dumps.

On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u00e2\u0080\u0099 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments.

To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00c3\u00a9, called Hulhumal\u00c3\u00a9.\nHulhumal\u00c3\u00a9 has become known as \u00e2\u0080\u0098the city of hope\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00a0\u00e2\u0080\u0094 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise.

No one knows what the long-term impacts will be, he says.\nIn many parts of the world, including the Maldives, land reclamation can be beneficial, say scientists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn my opinion, it can be a positive thing around Mal\u00c3\u00a9,\u00e2\u0080\u009d says Duvat, because of population pressures there.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "\u201cSun, sand and sea.\u201d Those are the three ingredients for tourism in the Maldives, Mohamed Shaiz\u2019s father told him. For more than a decade, Shaiz\u2019s family owned a successful local hotel in Addu, the Maldives\u2019 southernmost atoll. But nearly 9 months ago, the government took away the sea. A state-sponsored project had pulled up sediment from offshore areas and used it to extend the beach in front of the hotel by 130 metres \u2014 too far to walk for most tourists who want easy access to the ocean. Now all Shaiz sees from his hotel is a human-made desert and a slew of cancelled reservations. The Maldives is an 820-kilometre-long chain of nearly 1,200 islands dotting the Indian Ocean. The nation has become one of the most popular luxury tourism destinations in the world because of its Instagrammable beaches and its advertising slogan: \u201cthe sunny side of life\u201d. But the Maldives is also one of the countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. With 80% of its land less than one metre above sea level, some scientists predict that the islands could be completely submerged by 2100. In an effort to keep the country above water and thriving, the government is adopting a strategy used by many nations around the globe: land reclamation. The sandy stretch in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is some of the newest land on the planet, dug up from the bottom of the ocean, sucked through pipes and piled along the coast to make more space. Maldivian government officials say that the land is necessary to make room for economic development, especially as sea levels rise. Critics are unconvinced, and say that the country has enough space to thrive. One swathe of land on a neighbouring island near Shaiz\u2019s hotel was reclaimed in 2016. It remains undeveloped today. In addition to the disputed economics, there is serious concern about the environmental damage that land reclamation can cause. Studies in the Maldives and at other sites around the world have shown that it can harm corals and seagrass, damage natural barriers, such as sand bars, mangroves and estuaries, and destroy marine habitats. The island of Gulhifalhu lies just west of the capital, Mal\u00e9. A reclamation project started in 2020 is filling in half the atoll. Dutch planners are often considered the founders of land reclamation, with a history of water engineering going back some 800 years. Over the centuries, land-forming projects have shaped some of the world\u2019s major cities, including Singapore, London, New York and Miami. In recent decades, most of the reclaimed land has been in East Asia. In China, Shanghai has reclaimed 350 square kilometres \u2014 more than three times the size of Paris \u2014 over the past few decades. Colombo has added 100 km2 in just 4 years, and 65 km2 of Mumbai is reclaimed. A study on twenty-first-century coastal-land reclamation found that of 135 large coastal cities with populations of more than one million people, 75% had reclaimed land. With projects stretching back to 1997, the Maldives is a veteran of large-scale land reclamation. Then-minister of state for environment Abdulla Naseer said in 2018 that there are an estimated 50 islands with reclaimed land in the country, although many specialists say that\u2019s a conservative estimate. Land scarcity is a key factor driving reclamation projects. Although the nation\u2019s territory covers 90,000 km2, more than 99% of it is ocean. Around half a million people live on a total land area of just 300 km2, and the country welcomes around 1.3 million tourists each year, who contribute 80% of its gross domestic product. The capital, Mal\u00e9, is one of the most densely populated parts of the planet. It\u2019s possible to walk across the entire island in 20 minutes. The Maldives\u2019 1,200 islands are all atolls \u2014 rings of coral reef that surround lagoons. When the government decides to reclaim land, it takes sand from the lagoons using boats outfitted with suction pipes, which collect sand and coral debris from the ocean floor like giant vacuum cleaners. The boat then deposits the material in a different spot, either inside or outside the atoll, to form new land. Sometimes reclamation projects fill in the entire lagoon. Addu Atoll, the site of Shaiz\u2019s hotel, is about two hours south of Mal\u00e9 by aeroplane. Its rich coral reefs support more than 1,200 species of fish \u2014 one of the factors that led the United Nations cultural organization UNESCO to include the atoll in its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in 2020. Some of the islands are so narrow that you can almost always see water on both sides while standing in the centre. It\u2019s a largely quiet and rural place that feels forgotten. Yet construction marches on. The Ministry of National Planning, Housing and Infrastructure announced the Addu Development Project in 2021, aiming to reclaim parts of the atoll and develop a road connection between existing islands. One of the ministry\u2019s justifications is that it will provide extra housing. In the Maldives, land for houses is given away to eligible individuals and families. Addu City\u2019s mayor, Ali Nizar, says that there have been more than 5,000 requests for housing since he entered office in 2021. A reclamation project in Addu started in early 2023 and is adding land for housing, businesses and resorts. Because Addu has one of the few international airports in the country, the hope is also that the extra land will attract international investment. The project has been controversial from the start. When it was announced, Ibrahim Mohamed was sitting at his desk at the Maldives\u2019 Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Mal\u00e9. He instantly had concerns about how the project would affect Addu. Mohamed grew up in Addu in the 1970s, taking walks through the massive seagrass beds near his home. He remembers watching stingrays surf the waves, and marvelling at fiddler crabs along the shore. Mohamed led the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process for land-reclamation projects. When the Addu proposal landed on his desk, he contracted an environmental consulting group called Water Solutions, headquarted in Mal\u00e9, to do the review. The environmental impact report, published in February 2022, found that \u201cthe proposed reclamation is well received by the community\u201d and that there was \u201chigh interest to implement the project based on the potential economic benefits\u201d. But it also concluded that \u201clong-term irreversible negative impacts will be generated from the project\u201d for both the environment and the community, including by destroying coral reefs and seagrass meadows and harming the fishing and tourism industries. \u201cIt was sufficient enough for the EPA to reject the project,\u201d Mohamed says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t.\u201d In May 2022, he quit his job after 10 years at the agency. After the report came out, the EPA pushed for changes, such as a smaller area from which the project would source sand. \u201cWe tried to change the scope because we are here to protect the environment and at the same time, help development,\u201d says the agency\u2019s director-general, Ibrahim Naeem. \u201cDevelopment has to go hand in hand with environment. It should not destroy the environment,\u201d he says. Once the changes were made to the proposed project, Water Solutions produced a second report to assess the environmental impacts at the end of September 2022. It found that the altered project, with increased mitigation and monitoring in place, would still have irreversible negative impacts \u2014 ranging from moderate to major \u2014 on marine plants and animals, protected and sensitive areas, tourism, fisheries and recreational activities. The assessment calculated that the cost of the damage to coral reefs alone would be between US$340 million and $851 million. The September 2022 report does not offer explicit recommendations. \u201cOur role is to share the information. We just wanted to present the facts,\u201d says Ahmed Jameel, managing director of Water Solutions and one of the authors of the report. However, he adds, the assessment was not vague in its conclusions. The findings showed clearly that the project \u201cwould have an overall negative impact\u201d, he says. When asked about the concerns raised in the second report, Naeem says that the findings, combined with insights he received from EPA staff members who conducted anonymous reviews of the EIA, indicated that there was \u201cenough justification in the report to approve it in terms of social benefit\u201d. \u201cAny development projects in this type of environment, especially in the marine area, will have an impact,\u201d he says, adding that \u201cif you do reclamation properly, and if you do it wisely, I think impacts can be minimized\u201d. The Dutch company responsible for doing the construction on the project, Van Oord, told Nature that environmental management for the project is overseen by the EPA and that it is working with the agency and local specialists to minimize the environmental impacts. Van Oord said it prepared a comprehensive environmental management plan \u201cbased on the mitigation measures mandated in the EIA and in compliance with international guidelines\u201d. As part of its efforts, the company relocated coral and seagrass, and added silt screens to limit how much sediment would flow beyond the reclamation zone and affect other areas. Van Oord, which is based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, told Nature that \u201call the predicted impacts have been effectively managed by implementing a series of mitigation measures\u201d. In October 2022, the EPA approved the project. But critics say the environmental costs of the reclamation are too high. \u201cI think their efforts are not worth the amount of destruction and the irreversible damage,\u201d says Mohamed. \u201cIt can never be compensated properly.\u201d Today, the land in front of Shaiz\u2019s hotel is the result of that decision. Yet if you speak to people on Addu, many say that land is not what they need right now; they need jobs. Much of Addu is filled with empty, unfinished homes because individuals don\u2019t have the income or resources to build houses on their free land. \u201cFifty per cent [of our land] is abandoned or empty,\u201d says Addu\u2019s former deputy mayor, Abdullah Thoyyib, who served the city before this reclamation project took place. \u201cWe need economic benefits and job opportunities, but that\u2019s not happening.\u201d Sitting in a resort in Addu City, Nisal Musthag places a map of Addu\u2019s main diving spots on the table. Musthag leads diving trips for one of the two active resorts in the atoll, and he has seen some of the damage that follows reclamation projects. He points at one of the four channels between the island\u2019s lagoon and the ocean. \u201cThis is like a cemetery now,\u201d he says. Musthag does three to four dives a day, six days a week. Since the most-recent reclamation, there are at least five sites he no longer takes guests to. \u201cThere are people who come back every year to dive, and this year they were like, hey, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The impacts of reclamation on coral health are one of researchers\u2019 main concerns. Some reefs die when sediment is dumped on them to create new land. But even corals that escape direct damage can be harmed because the construction work creates clouds of sediment that spread out and settle on more distant reefs. Robbed of light and nutrients, these corals can struggle to survive. The damage to reefs not only harms the ecosystem but can also leave the islands vulnerable to storms and sea-level rise, say scientists. To reduce damage to corals during the work at Addu, the EIA required that at least 10% of existing corals be relocated outside the reclamation footprints. Van Oord says it has moved 73,000 corals to 9 recipient sites identified in conjunction with the EPA. The firm says that it \u201ccertainly surpassed the EIA requirement\u201d. Saleem Rasheed is one of several local divers who helped to relocate the corals. He has been monitoring them for the past year. One species, blue coral (Heliopora coerulea), which was moved from the outside of the atoll to the inside, died completely. \u201cWe moved 80 colonies,\u201d says Rasheed. \u201cThey survived one week and died entirely after six months.\u201d But the rest of the species have shown resilience. Three months after relocation, they were struggling, but now, Rasheed says, they are alive and well. Researchers have found that coral relocation can work if colonies are moved to areas with similar conditions that are protected from waves. A 2017 study in Hawaii, for example, showed that relocated corals were thriving a decade after they were moved. One study on coral restoration and relocation in the Maldives measured the survival rate of 242 coral fragments 12 months after they had been moved. The authors found a 70% survival rate, which they concluded was a promising result. But coral health is only one concern for researchers studying the effects of reclamation. Mangroves, seagrass beds and coastal ecosystems can also be in harm\u2019s way, say scientists. Water Solutions\u2019 second report about the Addu project, for example, projected that the reclamation process would bury about 98 hectares of seagrass meadow in the atoll\u2019s lagoon, at an estimated economic cost of more than $3.7 million a year. Not far from Shaiz\u2019s hotel, a sea wall stretches towards the horizon, protecting a new swathe of land made of sand and coral debris. Coastal protection efforts such as the sea wall \u2014 and the changes wrought by reclamation \u2014 could have long-lasting effects on the processes that keep the islands from eroding, say researchers. Like other atolls, the Maldivian islands evolve with the seasons, with monsoons moving sand around them. Between December and February, the winds transport sand from the northeast to the southwest. Between June and August, the pattern reverses. \u201cIn a natural island, you will see seasonally the sand shifting with the waves and the currents,\u201d says Mohamed. But reclamation can impede this process, he adds, by taking sand and coral debris from some locations through dredging \u2014 leaving a deficit in its wake \u2014 and depositing it where natural flows wouldn\u2019t. Some projects add another complication by building hard barriers, such as sea walls, to protect the land, because they can stop the natural flow of sediments. \u201cEcosystems can adapt if we allow them to,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck at Deltares. \u201cBy interfering, you will kill the whole system in the end.\u201d Not only does this change how the island naturally maintains itself, but it can also draw development to places that are at a high risk of a storm surge or erosion, say some researchers. \u201cIslands can\u2019t occur anywhere,\u201d says Virginie Duvat, a coastal geographer at La Rochelle University in France, who has studied the effects of land reclamation in the Maldives. \u201cIf you put an island where there was naturally no island, you create vulnerable land and you will necessarily have to build strong engineered structures, breakwaters and sea walls,\u201d she says. In a 2019 study, Duvat and Alexandre Magnan, a geographer at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations \u2014 Sciences Po in Paris, assessed the scale of coastal changes that humans had made to 107 inhabited islands in the Maldives between 2004\u201306 and 2014\u201316. On almost half the islands, the researchers found significant degradation in the reefs\u2019 abilities to weaken waves and provide natural sources of sediments. One-fifth of the islands had almost entirely or entirely \u201clost their natural capacity to respond and adjust to ocean climate-related pressures\u201d, the researchers say. \u201cIt means that a decision you have taken one day to rely on reclaimed land will necessarily cause you to invest more money,\u201d says Duvat. \u201cYou are locked into the engineered path for decades and decades and potentially the rest of the century.\u201d \u201cIf you build a levee, people will think they\u2019re safe,\u201d says van Wesenbeeck. \u201cBut is it wise to destroy environmental assets to create investment in an area that\u2019s one of the most vulnerable in the world for climate change?\u201d Some 550 km to the north of Addu, the capital, Mal\u00e9, sits like an overpopulated postage stamp in the middle of the ocean. Mal\u00e9 is tiny \u2014 less than 2 km across at its widest point \u2014 but more than 200,000 people live on the island. To relieve population pressures, the government decided in the late 1990s to start reclaiming a massive atoll next to Mal\u00e9, called Hulhumal\u00e9. Hulhumal\u00e9 has become known as \u2018the city of hope\u2019 \u2014 a place that not only has room but is also protected from sea-level rise. Architects designed it with sea-level-rise scenarios until 2100 in mind. The outer edges are 2 metres above sea level, more than twice the height of Mal\u00e9. Hulhulmal\u00e9 is regarded by specialists mainly as a worthwhile success for land reclamation, but critics have raised many questions about three newer projects on the western side of Mal\u00e9, all of which are being built using sand from the nearby lagoon. In 2021, Humay Abdulghafoor, a Mal\u00e9-based veteran fighter against land reclamation, sued three institutional bodies of the government on the grounds that they violated an environmental-protection law. She said that a new reclamation project risked causing serious environmental, economic and cultural damage to the local community by undermining \u201cthe economic and social benefits flowing from the natural environment and biodiversity richness of the Maldives\u201d, according to her legal case. The case has been ongoing for years, but on 14 February, it had its first breakthrough. The country\u2019s High Court decided to pause a dredging project near Mal\u00e9. However, the next day, the Supreme Court said that this pause would cause significant financial losses and overturned the decision. Mauroof Jameel, one of five architects chosen to build Hulhumal\u00e9, also has concerns about the latest projects. Jameel, who is based in Mal\u00e9, says that it made sense to reclaim land at Hulhumal\u00e9 to address congestion and help to build up the economy, but he is hesitant about how fast reclamation projects are now taking place. No one knows what the long-term impacts will be, he says. In many parts of the world, including the Maldives, land reclamation can be beneficial, say scientists. \u201cIn my opinion, it can be a positive thing around Mal\u00e9,\u201d says Duvat, because of population pressures there. But she doesn\u2019t see as much justification in more rural, distant atolls. \u201cIn this case, I cannot see the benefits.\u201d Officials with the Maldivian government acknowledge that land reclamation can cause harm. But there is no indication that the process is slowing down. Just 3 months after Muizzu was inaugurated as president last November, he announced the biggest reclamation project the nation has ever seen \u2014another endeavour to reclaim land near Mal\u00e9 on top of those already in the works. \u201cThe brand-new model city will revolutionize the country\u2019s urban landscape, addressing housing challenges in the greater Mal\u00e9 region by providing 65,000 housing units,\u201d he said in February at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. But many former officials urge caution. \u201cHow we create land, and the extent to which we do it, is excessive,\u201d says Mohamed Aslam, the minister of planning, housing and infrastructure for the previous administration, the agency responsible for land-reclamation projects. He says that land is often reclaimed as an easy way to keep the public happy, to show them that the government is doing something. \u201cThe easy part is building the land,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly after that does the hard part begin.\u201d",

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations.

And it's picked up the pace in recent years.\nIn the last 80 years, sea level rise has risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that total in the last 30 years, said Brian McNoldy, a senior research associate at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric and Earth Science.\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's best estimates, that pace is expected to speed up\u2014dramatically.\nIt took about 80 years for the first foot. The second one will only take 30 years. The next, 20 years. And Florida could see the next foot in merely a decade after that.\n\"Sea level rise is beginning to speed up a bit,\" McNoldy said. \"If you draw a straight line it starts to not look so straight in recent decades.\"\nThat's according to NOAA's \"intermediate-high\" projection of sea level rise. The agency created a range of predictions\u2014low, intermediate-low, intermediate, intermediate-high and high\u2014to estimate what sea level rise could look like in places like Florida.\nSo far, scientists have found that we're trending toward the high end of those predictions.\n\"Presently, sea level is tracking in the intermediate-high to high, the two fastest,\" said Randall Parkinson, a coastal geologist with Florida International University. \"The other three scenarios, you might not even think about because we're already rising faster than that.\"\nThose are the same predictions used by South Florida governments when deciding how high to build new developments. But after a new bill signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis this year, local governments hoping for state money for sea rise projects have to only consider the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios, a downgrade from previous legislation that asked them to consider intermediate-low and intermediate-high scenarios.\nWhat goes into a sea rise projection?\nTwo feet of sea rise by 2060, compared to present-day levels, would be a shock to the system for Miami, where the average elevation is three feet. That's why local governments\u2014and the state\u2014are spending billions to keep streets dry.\nHowever, pinning down exactly how much sea rise South Florida could experience is a tough task.\nResearchers know the two main factors in sea level rise are the temperature of the ocean and how much the ice sheets melt. As burned fossil fuels trap more heat in the atmosphere, that heat is largely being absorbed by the ocean. Hotter water physically takes up more space than cold water, so a hotter ocean means higher sea levels. A hotter atmosphere also means gigantic ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are melting, pouring tremendous amounts of now-liquid water into the sea.\nThose two issues make up the lion's share of impact to rising sea levels, but South Florida also has its own unique challenges that add to rising water levels.\nThere's the fact that some parts of the land are actually sinking, a process known as subsidence. However, it's not very much\u2014the depth of two credit cards stacked on top of each other over half a decade in one spot in Miami Beach.\n\"It does add to an already dire situation, but it isn't a driving force,\" Parkinson said.\nThe one big unknown in South Florida's future of sea level rise is likely the water rushing offshore. The Gulf Stream, a massive current that moves hot water from the tropics to the frigid depths of the Arctic, has a little offshoot that runs between Florida's east coast and the Bahamas.\nThe Florida Current, as it's known, has an impact on Miami's water levels. When the current is stronger, water levels are generally a bit lower in Miami. And when it's weaker, they have been shown to rise.\nA new paper from Lisa Beal, professor of ocean sciences at UM's Rosenstiel School, and Chris Piecuch, a physical oceanographer at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, found for the first time that this current may be slowing down.\n\"We found that there is a weakening. It's small,\" she said.\nThe article, published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters in September, suggested that the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% in the last 40 years, although it did not directly link that change to global warming.\nBeal said the findings were significant for Florida.\n\"We shouldn't get carried away that weakening of the Gulf Stream is going to double sea level rise in Miami. It isn't,\" she said. However, \"when you're so low-lying like South Florida, you'd kind of want to know because it means you reach thresholds of flooding much more quickly.\"\nBut perhaps the biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise boils down to one thing: exactly how much more pollution the world will continue to spew into the atmosphere. The lower-end predictions account for a world in which governments stop burning fossil fuels quickly, and the higher-end predictions are based on a situation where we burn even more than we are now.\n\"One of the great unknowns is, the world needs to be attempting to slow down the release of greenhouse gases,\" McNoldy said.\n\nJournal information:\nGeophysical Research Letters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  2024 Miami Herald.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Sea levels are rising faster in South Florida, impacting roads and homes. Over the past 80 years, sea levels have risen about a foot, with 8 inches of that rise occurring in the last 30 years, according to Brian McNoldy from the University of Miami. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) predicts this pace will accelerate, with the next foot of rise expected in just 30 years, then 20 years, and possibly a decade after that. Currently, sea levels are tracking towards NOAA's intermediate-high to high projections, the fastest scenarios. Local governments in South Florida use these projections to plan new developments, although recent legislation now requires them to consider only the intermediate-low and intermediate scenarios for state-funded projects. The main factors driving sea level rise are ocean temperature and ice sheet melt. As fossil fuels trap more heat, the ocean absorbs it, causing water to expand and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to melt, adding more water to the sea. South Florida also faces land subsidence, though it's minimal. The Florida Current, part of the Gulf Stream, affects Miami's water levels; a weaker current can lead to higher sea levels. A study by Lisa Beal and Chris Piecuch found the Gulf Stream has slowed by about 4% over the last 40 years. The biggest uncertainty in future sea level rise is the amount of pollution the world will continue to emit. Lower-end predictions assume a rapid reduction in fossil fuel use, while higher-end predictions assume continued or increased emissions.",

But those among the estimated 20 million people living along Bangladesh's coast say the destruction comes in terrifying waves.\n\"It is closing in,\" said fisherman Aziz about the approaching sea. \"Where else can we escape?\"\n'Bodies can't endure this'\nThe threat is increasing.\nMost of the country's coastal areas are a meter or two above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, turning wells and lakes salty and killing crops on once fertile land.\n\"When the surge is higher, the seawater intrudes into our houses and land,\" said Ismail Howladar, a 65-year-old farmer growing chili peppers, sweet potatoes, sunflowers and rice.\n\"It brings only loss for us.\"\nCyclones -- which have killed hundreds of thousands of people in Bangladesh in recent decades -- are becoming more frequent as well as growing in intensity and duration due to the impact of climate change, scientists say.\nShahjalal Mia, a 63-year-old restaurant owner, said he watches the sea \"grasp more land\" each year.\n\"Many people have lost their homes to the sea already,\" he said. \"If there is no beach, there won't be any tourists.\"\nHe said he had experienced cyclones and searing heat waves grow worse, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).\n\"We are facing two, three, even four cyclones every year now,\" he said.\n\"And I can't measure temperatures in degrees but, simply put, our bodies can't endure this\".\n'Too late'\nBangladesh is among the countries ranked most vulnerable to disasters and climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\nIn April, the nation of around 170 million people experienced the hottest month, and the most sustained heat wave temperatures, in its history.\nLast month, a cyclone that killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes, was one of the quickest-forming and longest-lasting seen, the government's meteorological department said.\nBoth events were pinned on rising global temperatures.\nAinun Nishat, from Brac University in the capital Dhaka, said that the poorest were paying the price for carbon emissions from wealthier nations.\n\"We cannot do anything for Bangladesh if other nations, notably rich countries, do not do anything to fight emissions,\" he said.\nBangladesh is running out of time, Nishat added.\n\"It is becoming too late to prevent disasters,\" he said. \"We are unequipped to bring change.\"\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \u00a9 2024 AFP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\n Feedback to editors\n15 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\n16 hours ago\n0\nSep 22, 2024\n0\n7 hours ago\n8 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\n13 hours ago\nRelevant PhysicsForums posts\nSep 19, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nSep 7, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 23, 2024\nAug 18, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMore from Earth Sciences\n\nRelated Stories\nMay 28, 2024\nMay 1, 2024\nApr 29, 2024\nMay 27, 2024\nMay 26, 2024\nMay 28, 2024\nRecommended for you\n18 hours ago\n16 hours ago\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 21, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\nSep 20, 2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general inquiries, please use our  contact form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

    "Summarized_Document2": "After cyclone gales destroyed his home in 2007, Bangladeshi fisherman Abdul Aziz moved half a kilometer inland. A year later, the sea swallowed his old home. Now, 75-year-old Aziz fishes above his submerged former home and lives behind a low embankment. Government scientists report that rising seas driven by climate change are submerging Bangladesh's coast at one of the fastest global rates, potentially displacing at least a million people within a generation. Abdul Hamid, director general of the environment department, noted that Bangladesh experiences the effects of climate change intensely. A recent three-part study found that sea levels in Bangladesh are rising more than 60% higher than the global average. By 2050, over a million people may need to relocate due to local sea level rise, based on 25 years of satellite data from NASA and CNSA. Study lead A.K.M Saiful Islam attributed the above-average increases to melting ice caps, warming oceans, and river water from the monsoon. The study observed sea level rises of 4.2 to 5.8 millimeters annually along Bangladesh's coast, compared to the global average of 3.7 millimeters. This incremental rise has devastating effects on the estimated 20 million coastal residents. Most coastal areas are just one or two meters above sea level, and storms bring seawater further inland, salinizing wells and lakes and killing crops. Cyclones, which have killed hundreds of thousands in recent decades, are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Shahjalal Mia, a restaurant owner, noted the worsening cyclones and heat waves, with temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. Bangladesh is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index. In April, the country experienced its hottest month and most sustained heat wave. A recent cyclone killed at least 17 people and destroyed 35,000 homes. Ainun Nishat from Brac University emphasized that the poorest are paying the price for emissions from wealthier nations. He warned that it is becoming too late to prevent disasters, and Bangladesh is unequipped to bring change.",

    "Document1": "eBay Statistics: Insights and Trends (2024)\nExplanation:We fact-check all of our content to ensure you have reliable and up-to-date information for your eCommerce business decisions.Learn about our fact-checking process.\nWhether you\u2019re already an eBay seller, or only thinking about selling on eBay occasionally, statistics are a sure way to prove which direction is best to consider for your online store. Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\nOn this page\nWhen Was eBay Established?\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers with insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\neBay Statistic Overview\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits.\nLastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\nMORE: How to increase sales on eBay\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\nMORE: How to sell on eBay and make money\neBay Seller Statistics\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\neCommerce\u2019s Share of Total Retail Sales in the US\nMORE: eBay vacation mode\neBay Advertising Statistics\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\nMORE: How to set up an eBay store\neBay Buyer Statistics\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\nMORE: How to issue partial refund on eBay\nHow Many People Use eBay\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\nNumber of eBay total active buyers from 1st Quarter 2010 to 2nd Quarter 2023 (in millions)\nA Shift After 2018\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\nMORE: eBay seller help\nMORE: eBay refurbished\neBay Website Traffic Share\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\nMORE: How to ship items on eBay\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\nMORE: eBay selling tips\nMORE: eBay selling limits\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\nMORE: Shopify eBay integration\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\nAlso see our\u00a0eBay Fee Calculator.\nKey Takeaways\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.\nMORE: Discover Amazon Statistics.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nHow popular is eBay now?\nWhat age group uses eBay the most?\nIs eBay getting less popular?\nWho is eBay's target audience?\nWho is the #1 seller on eBay?\nAuthor\nDominika Kaminska\nAmazing content you need, amazing content we deliver.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

We have provided the below disclosure as we believe it presents a clear comparison of our period to period operating results by removing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and to assist investors in understanding our financial and operating performance. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income/loss are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies. Such non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n\u00a0\nKey Performance Indicators\nThe following represents a summary of our key performance indicators, along with period-over-period changes:\n\u00a0\n_________________________\n1.

    "Summarized_Document1": "eBay Statistics: Insights and Trends (2024)\n\nWe fact-check all of our content to ensure you have reliable and up-to-date information for your eCommerce business decisions. Learn about our fact-checking process.\n\nWhether you\u2019re already an eBay seller or only thinking about selling on eBay occasionally, statistics are a sure way to prove which direction is best to consider for your online store. Today, we will delve deep into eBay revenue throughout the years, eBay sales statistics by category, and much more.\n\nWhen Was eBay Established?\n\nEstablished in 1995 as a platform for auction-style sales, eBay swiftly expanded its horizons, becoming a global marketplace for both new and second-hand items. Today, its influence stretches across continents, reaching millions of buyers and sellers alike. The statistics provided in this article are intended to give eBay sellers insight into potential eBay selling opportunities.\n\nMake Money Selling on eBay!\n\neBay Statistic Overview\n\nOnline marketplaces have revolutionized the way we shop, offering a wide array of products at our fingertips. A recent study by Statista sheds light on the dominance and reach of these platforms in the U.S. market as of April 2023.\n\nAmazon is at the top of the list, with a whopping 58.03% share of online visits. Trailing behind, but still maintaining a strong presence, is eBay with a 13.11% share. The results demonstrate eBay\u2019s enduring relevance, even in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.\n\nWalmart also maintains its lead in the online market with a 6.53% share, demonstrating its successful transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer to a significant online player. Etsy, known for unique and handmade items, accounted for 5.02% of visits. Lastly, Target, another retail giant, holds a 2.64% share, underscoring its efforts to boost its online footprint. These eBay stats emphasize the competitive nature of online retail and highlight the importance of innovation and customer engagement in retaining and growing market share.\n\nWhat Does This Mean for eBay Sellers?\n\nFirst and foremost, despite the towering presence of Amazon, eBay still commands a respectable 13.11% share of online visits as of April 2023. This indicates that eBay remains a formidable platform with a vast and engaged customer base. Sellers can leverage this large audience to diversify their online presence and reach a different segment of buyers.\n\nHowever, the competition is fierce. With Amazon dominating the market, eCommerce sellers must bring their A-game when listing on eBay. This entails providing high-quality product images, crafting compelling product descriptions, offering competitive pricing, and ensuring top-notch customer service.\n\nMoreover, the rise of platforms such as Walmart and Etsy suggests that eCommerce is not a one-size-fits-all business. Different platforms cater to different demographics and offer unique selling propositions. For instance, while Etsy caters to a niche of handmade and unique products, Walmart and Target, being traditional retailers, might appeal to a demographic looking for established brands or specific product categories.\n\nAll in all, the data suggests that while eBay remains a relevant and viable platform for eCommerce sellers, it\u2019s crucial to approach it with a tailored strategy. Understanding the platform\u2019s audience, staying up-to-date on market trends, and differentiating oneself from competitors are essential steps to achieving success on eBay.\n\neBay Seller Statistics\n\nThe eBay Seller Statistics reveal a transformative trajectory in the retail landscape, particularly in the U.S. The data depicts the growing importance and influence of eCommerce on total retail sales over the past decade. In 2013, eCommerce made up a modest 5.8% of total retail sales. However, according to Statista, by 2025, this figure is projected to rise to 21.9%.\n\nDiving deeper into the data, we notice a steady progression in the earlier years. By 2019, eCommerce accounted for 11.1% of total sales. Yet, a remarkable shift occurred in 2020, when the figure surged to 14.2% \u2014 a 3.1% leap from the previous year. This could be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted a radical change in consumer behavior. As brick-and-mortar stores faced restrictions or shutdowns, and consumers prioritized safety, online shopping became the preferred, if not the only, option for many.\n\nInterestingly, the eCommerce percentage remained stagnant at 14.2% in 2021, suggesting that the rapid adoption of online shopping in the previous year had reached a temporary plateau or that consumers returned to physical stores as restrictions eased. Nevertheless, the projection for 2023 shows another leap, with eCommerce constituting 17.9% of total sales. By 2025, almost 22% of all retail sales in the U.S. are expected to be online.\n\nFor eBay sellers and other eCommerce merchants, these figures underscore a clear trend: the digital marketplace is not just a supplementary channel but is increasingly becoming a dominant force in the retail sector. Sellers should prepare for this ongoing digital shift, optimizing their online presence, improving customer experience, and ensuring they are well-equipped to handle the increasing volume and demands of online consumers.\n\neBay Advertising Statistics\n\nAnother important seller statistic showcases the change in digital retail media advertising spending in the US from 2020 to 2025.\n\nThe evolution of digital retail media advertising spending in the U.S. from 2020 to 2025 provides interesting insights into the evolution of digital marketing in the retail sector. In 2020, a significant 53.3% of advertising spending was channeled into digital retail media, reflecting the rise of eCommerce and the urgency for businesses to capture online audiences.\n\nHowever, the subsequent year, 2021, witnessed a decline to 49.3%. This reduction might suggest that many businesses, after heavily investing in digital advertising during the early pandemic months, decided to reevaluate or diversify their advertising strategies, or perhaps even faced budget constraints due to economic challenges.\n\nThe most striking transformation occurred in 2022, where the percentage plummeted to 21.5%. This sharp decline could be indicative of several factors, such as market saturation, the evolution of alternative advertising mediums, or a strategic shift in the retail sector\u2019s advertising focus.\n\nThe figures from 2023 to 2025 reveal a stabilization of the trend, hovering around the low twenties. The projection of 19.7% in 2023, followed by a slight rise to 22.5% in 2024, and then a modest increment to 23.2% in 2025 suggests that while digital retail media advertising remains vital, it might not be the primary focus as it once was in 2020.\n\nFor sellers, this trend underscores the importance of adopting a holistic advertising strategy. While digital retail media advertising is essential, it\u2019s equally critical to diversify marketing efforts, explore innovative channels, and ensure that the chosen mediums align with the brand\u2019s target audience and goals.\n\nThe statistics reflect a dynamic digital advertising landscape, emphasizing the need for adaptability and a strategic approach to remain competitive and effective.\n\neBay Buyer Statistics\n\nDelving into eBay\u2019s active buyer statistics from the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2023 offers a revealing glimpse into the platform\u2019s journey, its peaks of popularity, and the challenges it faced amidst a rapidly changing digital marketplace. The increase in total active buyers on eBay from the 1st quarter of 2010 to the 2nd quarter of 2023 provides valuable insights into the platform\u2019s popularity and market penetration through time.\n\nHow Many People Use eBay\n\nStarting in Q1 2010, eBay boasted a healthy 89.5 million active buyers, a figure that saw consistent growth over the next several years. By Q1 2011, this number rose modestly to 95.9 million. However, it wasn\u2019t until Q3 2012 that the platform witnessed a more substantial increase, hitting the 108.3 million mark.\n\nThis upward trend continued to surge as 2013 rolled in, with 123.5 million active buyers in the first quarter, followed by a leap to 145.1 million by Q1 2014. This consistent rise is indicative of eBay\u2019s strong market position during these years and possibly its efforts to expand its services, improve user experience, and diversify its product listings.\n\nThe momentum slightly decelerated but remained positive, with the number climbing to 156 million by Q1 2015 and then experiencing slower growth over the subsequent years, touching 162 million in Q1 2016 and 165 million in Q1 2017. A more noticeable growth spurt occurred in 2018, peaking at 179 million active users by its end.\n\nA Shift After 2018\n\nHowever, post-2018, the trajectory began to shift. From a high of 179 million in Q4 2018, the numbers slightly decreased to 171 million in Q1 2019. The impact of the global pandemic in 2020 is evident, with numbers fluctuating between 174 million in Q1 and a drop to 161 million in Q2. Post-pandemic periods in 2021 and 2022 saw the figures retreat further, descending to 142 million by Q1 2022.\n\nBy the first quarter of 2023, the number further diminished to 133 million, indicating potential challenges in retaining or attracting new users or the possible rise of competitive platforms. For sellers, understanding this trend is crucial. While eBay remains a significant player in the e-Commerce space, it\u2019s vital to monitor such trends, evaluate buyer behaviors, and possibly diversify platforms to ensure sustained reach and sales.\n\neBay Website Traffic Share\n\nIn July 2023, approximately 68 percent of visitors to ebay.com came from the United States. Of these U.S. eBay visitors, 54 percent favored using desktop devices to access the site. However, in other examined countries, most users showed a preference for mobile browsing.\n\neBay\u2019s Second-Hand Purchase Trend\n\nAnother important buyer statistic is the share of eBay buyers purchasing second-hand goods in order to save money in 2022.\n\nThe appeal of online marketplaces like eBay is frequently based on the diverse range of products they offer, which varies from brand-new items to second-hand or used goods. An intriguing trend that emerged in 2022 is the growing propensity of buyers to opt for second-hand items on eBay with a specific intention to save money.\n\nA significant 56% of all eBay buyers leaned towards purchasing pre-owned goods for monetary savings. Even more compelling is the insight into the behavior of the Gen Z demographic, a group typically associated with trends and new purchases. Surprisingly, 54% of Gen Z respondents also exhibited this thrift-conscious approach on eBay.\n\nThis reflects a shift in consumer behavior, where the value and cost-effectiveness of a purchase may overweigh the allure of brand-new items, even among the younger consumers. These patterns highlight the ever-evolving dynamics of eCommerce and hint at the emergence of a more budget-conscious consumer base.\n\nFrom this data, sellers should recognize the increasing appeal of second-hand or pre-owned items on platforms like eBay, especially for the purpose of cost-saving. This trend is not limited to a particular demographic but spans across, including the younger Gen Z.\n\nMonthly Downloads of the eBay App Worldwide\n\nGlobally, eBay saw its mobile app achieve 2.3 million downloads in July 2023. During the observed time frame, the highest monthly downloads worldwide occurred in January 2021, reaching 3.4 million for that month.\n\neBay Sales Statistics by Category\n\nIn February 2021, nearly a year after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, disposable face masks dominated eBay sales, averaging over 293 items sold for each listing every week. Mobile phones and smartphones also ranked high in sales, with listings selling an average of 76 units weekly.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nIn the rapidly shifting eCommerce landscape, sellers must remain agile and informed. Although Amazon continues its towering dominance in the online marketplace, eBay\u2019s 13.11% share in online visits as of April 2023 reveals its significant and enduring presence. However, the eCommerce environment is intensely competitive, making it essential for sellers to elevate their offerings on eBay through stellar product presentations, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.\n\nFurthermore, the emergence of platforms like Walmart and Etsy indicates the diverse needs and preferences of the online shopper. Importantly, the rise in buyers\u2019 preference for second-hand items on eBay, spanning all age groups, including Gen Z, underscores a growing budget-conscious trend. Thus, sellers need a strategic, adaptive, and diversified approach to maximize their reach and sales in this ever-evolving market.",

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.

Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

We're fully committed to executing our growth strategies and delivering immense value to our merchants for years to come.\"\n\"We are proud to report another quarter of robust financial performance.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. See the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures.\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nShopify Inc.\r\nReconciliation from GAAP to Non-GAAP Results (continued)(Expressed in US millions, except share and per share amounts)\n\u00a0\nFree Cash Flow Reconciliation\nThe following table illustrates how free cash flow is calculated in this press release:\n\u00a0\nFinancial Performance Constant Currency Analysis\nThe following table converts our GMV, revenues, gross profit and (loss) income from operations using the comparative period's monthly average exchange rates. The table below setting out the effect of foreign exchange rates on GMV and our consolidated statements of operations disclosure is a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

These measures are not recognized measures for financial presentation under U.S. GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other public companies.\n\nAdjusted gross profit, adjusted sales and marketing, adjusted research and development, adjusted general and administrative expenses, adjusted impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses, adjusted operating income/loss, adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes, accelerated stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangibles, severance related costs, provisions associated with litigation-related accruals, real estate-related impairment charges, and impairment on sales of Shopify's logistics businesses. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted net income/loss per share also exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on equity and other investments, net loss on equity method investment, and tax effects related to non-GAAP adjustments. Operating leverage is a non-GAAP ratio that is calculated by dividing adjusted operating expenses by revenue. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow margin is a non-GAAP ratio calculated as free cash flow divided by revenue. Shopify considers free cash flow and free cash flow margin as indicators of the efficiency and liquidity of Shopify's business, showing cash available after capital expenditures, to make strategic investments and drive future growth.\n\nManagement uses non-GAAP and other financial measures internally for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Shopify believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP and other financial measures used herein be considered as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.

    "Document2": "Etsy Doubles Down On Handmade To Build A Moat Around Its Marketplace\nNEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 13: \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.,  said ... [+] CEO Josh Silverman. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\nThe Etsy marketplace, the flagship of Esty Inc., which also includes resale site Depop and musical instrument specialist Reverb, was founded in 2005 to connect buyers with makers, artists, designers and crafters selling their unique handmade, originally designed new or specially-selected vintage items.\nHowever, as its seller community grew, inventory exploded and it expanded globally, the marketplace became increasingly difficult for customers to maneuver. Most significantly, it became flooded with goods that didn\u2019t meet the criteria that each item had to come with the maker\u2019s personal touch.\nEtsy\u2019s founding mission was to \u201ckeep commerce human\u201d and after hitting speedbumps over the last two years, it is doubling down on that mission or as CEO Josh Silverman said in the recent earnings call, \u201cWe\u2019re leaning in more than ever to what makes Etsy, Etsy.\u201d\nDisappointing Performance\nIn the first quarter 2024 ended March 31, Etsy marketplace reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sale (GMS) over the same period last year, from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion in 2024. Last year\u2019s first quarter was a bad one too, down 4.7% from $2.8 billion in 2022.\nFiscal 2023 was another disappointment. Esty marketplace GMS dropped 2% from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, while the number of active sellers exploded from 5.4 million to 7 million. Active buyers advanced 3% to 92 million.\nOn a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\u2019s loss was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge to write down the acquisition value of Depop and Brazilian-marketplace Elo7, both acquired at premium prices in 2021. Elo7 was divested in mid-2023 for an undisclosed sum. The company doesn\u2019t report revenues or net income on a brand level; however, Etsy marketplace accounted for 88% of GMS in 2023 and 86% in first quarter 2024.\nNonetheless, Esty Inc. ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting some 225 employees. \u201cWhile the Etsy marketplace is still more than double the size it was in 2019, we needed to acknowledge and adjust for today\u2019s realities,\u201d Silverman said in a statement.\n\u201cWe are operating in a very challenging macro and competitive environment, and GMS has remained essentially flat since 2021. This means we are not bringing our sellers more sales, which is the single most important thing we can do for them.\u201d\nThose challenges continued in the first quarter 2024, if not worsened, as he said in the earnings call, it was \u201canother challenging quarter for our type of goods, signaling to us that buyers shopped a bit less with us than they did in the prior year.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cMacro economic conditions also continue quite challenging in our other top markets, the U.K. and Germany. These headwinds are real. They do not appear to be abating and are impacting our sales.\n\u201cWhile so far, 2024 is still proving to be a cyclically challenging period for us, rest assured that we are clear eyed about what we need to accomplish to set Etsy back on a growth path.\u201d\nCourse Correction\nSilverman explained Etsy\u2019s path to growth starts with cleaning up the marketplace by removing sellers and listings that violate its handmade policy; what he phrased as decluttering Etsy\u2019s aisles.\nSo far the marketplace has removed millions of listings \u2013 115% more than in the previous year \u2013 and cut \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of sellers from its roles.\nWith less junk cluttering its virtual aisles, Etsy can better curate customers\u2019 selections based upon their shopping mission and elevate the visibility of items that are more relevant to the shoppers\u2019 needs and desires.\nFor example, Etsy\u2019s customers regularly frequent the site to find unique gift ideas and it just launched a Gift Mode platform to make gifts easier to find by product, gift occasion and recipient profile.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nWhile it aims to emphasize the human connection in Etsy customers\u2019 shopping journey, it is turning to digitally-powered large language models and GenAI tools to enhance the online shopping experience and match the shopping mission with available inventory.\n\u201cWe have a very significant opportunity to focus more on window shopping, gauging buyer experiences to spark imagination, capture impulse buys, get to know your tastes and preferences better and expand your understanding of the breadth of products available on Etsy, making Etsy more fun, engaging, inspiring and surprising,\u201d he said in the call.\nHoning The Human Connection\nFollowing the earnings call, Silverman sent a message to sellers explaining Etsy\u2019s new Creativity Standards, which he said represented not a policy change but heightened enforcement of existing guidelines.\nAll items for listing on Etsy must be either:\n\n\nAnd each item will now carry details on listing pages specifying whether its is Made by, Designed by, Sourced by or Handpicked by. He explained, \u201cVintage falls into the \u2018handpicked\u2019 category. And most craft and party supplies will live in the \u2018sourced by\u2019 section.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cOur research shows that the top thing buyers want to learn about is your involvement in your items. We\u2019ve also heard from you, sellers, asking us to better distinguish between items crafted solely by you and items made using production partners or other tools. This way, your unique craft shines through.\u201d\nTo make sure sellers are serious about complying with the guidelines, Etsy marketplace has established a $15 setup fee for new sellers. And it also will launch a loyalty program later in the year for frequent shoppers.\nToo Late?\nAll of which are admirable and much needed efforts by Silverman and his team to set Etsy back on course, but the question remains how did they let it go so far in the wrong direction?\nEtsy\u2019s been a prime destination to gifters for years, so what took it so long to turn on that spigot?\nIt consistently reports growth in active buyers and recovery of lapsed buyers, so why wasn\u2019t a loyalty program put on the front burner in 2021 when Etsy Inc. active buyers rose nearly 18% to 96 million?\nAnd as far back as 2022, it announced \u201cstepped-up Handmade Policy enforcement.\u201d Yet it\u2019s taken two years to put teeth into those policies.\nIn the latest earnings call, Silverman revealed that Etsy was sitting on more than 100 million lapsed buyers, but once a customer loses faith in a company, it\u2019s incredibly hard to regain their trust.\nWhen founded, Etsy had a unique point of differentiation and a secure moat around its business through its handmade, human commerce business model. Regrettably, Etsy let that slip to become more like Amazon, Shopify and Chinese-upstarts Shein and Temu.\nIt\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to convince those 100+ millions that Etsy\u2019s got its mojo back and they should return.\n\u201cEtsy should have taken more significant steps years ago, and now it faces tough competition, risking a further downward spiral,\u201d shared Juan Pellerano, chief marketing officer at Swap, which supports e-commerce operations for direct-to-consumer brands.\n\u201cIt finds itself in a challenging position due to the maturity of its business model. Although Etsy\u2019s pricing support for its merchants is commendable, it comes too late,\u201d he continued.\nSadly, Etsy finds itself in a hole it dug for itself and now it has to do the harder work to dig itself back out again.\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Etsy marketplace, founded in 2005, connects buyers with makers, artists, designers, and crafters selling unique handmade, originally designed, or specially-selected vintage items. However, as the seller community grew and inventory expanded globally, the marketplace became cluttered with goods that didn't meet Etsy's handmade criteria. In response, Etsy is doubling down on its founding mission to 'keep commerce human,' as stated by CEO Josh Silverman. In the first quarter of 2024, Etsy reported a 5.3% drop in gross merchandise sales (GMS) from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.6 billion. Fiscal 2023 also saw a 2% drop in GMS from $11.8 billion in 2022 to $11.6 billion, despite an increase in active sellers from 5.4 million to 7 million and a 3% rise in active buyers to 92 million. On a positive note, Etsy Inc. turned a $694 million net loss in 2022 into a $308 million gain in fiscal 2023. The loss in 2022 was primarily due to a $1 billion impairment charge related to the acquisitions of Depop and Elo7. Etsy ended 2023 by laying off 11% of its workforce, impacting 225 employees. Silverman acknowledged the challenging macro and competitive environment, noting that GMS has remained flat since 2021. To address these challenges, Etsy is removing millions of listings and cutting 'tens of thousands' of sellers to declutter its marketplace. The company is also leveraging digital tools like large language models and GenAI to enhance the shopping experience. Additionally, Etsy introduced new Creativity Standards to better distinguish between items crafted solely by sellers and those made using production partners. A $15 setup fee for new sellers and a loyalty program for frequent shoppers are also being implemented. Despite these efforts, questions remain about why Etsy took so long to address these issues. The company faces tough competition and must work hard to regain the trust of over 100 million lapsed buyers.",

And other retailers struggled to compete during the summer shopping holiday.\nKey takeaways:\nConsumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, and although year-over-year growth was modest when compared with the performance of prior Prime Days, it was a small uptick over 2022.\nAmazon is No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360\u2019s new\u00a02023 Global Online Marketplaces Report, which ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by 2023 third-party GMV.\nHow much did Amazon make on Prime Day?\nDigital Commerce 360 estimates Amazon\u2019s sales on Prime Day hit $12.90 billion globally during the manufactured retail holiday, which spanned July 11 and 12. That\u2019s up 6.7% year over year from the same shopping spree in 2022, which ran July 12 and 13. Last year, sales grew 8.1% over the 2021 event to $12.09 billion. In 2021, Prime Day sales reached $11.19 billion and represented a 7.7% increase over Amazon\u2019s 2020 event.\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. Amazon postponed Prime Day 2020, pushing it from its usual summer time slot to mid-October because of the coronavirus. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event. That\u2019s up from 300 million last year, Amazon says.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon, No. 1 in the\u00a0Digital Commerce 360 Top 1000, launched Prime Day in July 2015 to celebrate the web behemoth\u2019s 20th year in business, offering deals on a bunch of products to mark the occasion. As the event evolved, Prime Day turned into a highly anticipated summer sale designed to drum up more business for Amazon \u2014 and the retailer\u2019s marketplace sellers \u2014 before the holiday shopping season. In recent years, other large retailers have offered promotions on their own websites around Prime Day to take advantage of the additional online shopping traffic from deal-seeking consumers.\nThe inaugural Prime Day lasted for 24 hours and encompassed nine countries including the U.S. In 2017, the sale was extended for 30 hours and expanded to a few more markets, and in 2018, Prime Day was a 36-hour event. By 2019, Amazon began running its current two-day sale spanning 18 countries. And this year, more than 20 markets participated.\nWith discounts available only to paying members, Prime Day also is a vehicle for Amazon to sign up more consumers for its popular loyalty plan. The $139-a-year or $14.99-a-month Prime membership program offers perks like free one- or two-day shipping, digital photo storage, and video and music streaming.\nOther retailers sales slow on Prime Day\nAmazon isn\u2019t alone in doing big sales on weekdays in July. Many of its top competitors held sales during the same period, with No. 2 Walmart Inc. returning to the promotional holiday this year after sitting out last year.\nHowever, many retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year, according to Digital Commerce 360\u2019s analysis of Similarweb traffic numbers. Last year, for example, Target Corp. (No. 5 in the Top 1000) grew traffic 42.3% over a control period two weeks prior to Prime Day. This year, traffic was up just 26.9%. Costco Wholesale Corp. (No. 6) went from a 24.6% bump last year to 16.7% this year. Best Buy Co. (No. 7), which usually gets huge increases in traffic as shoppers compare prices on big-ticket items, saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year.\nWalmart, which didn\u2019t participate in Prime Day promos last year, saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%. But even Amazon had a smaller increase in traffic compared to the control period, down less than 1% compared to 2022\u2019s bump.\nSome of this is a difference in promo strategy. Retailers were heavily promotional during the 4th of July holiday period this year, with more offering Independence Day sales than competing with Prime Day. Also, top competitors offered week-long sales, meaning shoppers could focus on Amazon during its two-day sale and turn to Target, Walmart and Costco afterward to pick up other deals.\nFor the full week, Target\u2019s bump was still lower than last year, but the decline was much softer, with an 18.6% decline for the week compared to a 36.5% decline for the two-day period. Walmart\u2019s bump similarly grew when looking at the full week, up 56.0% for the week compared to a 49.2% increase for the two-day period.\nHow we got here\nHere are some insights that helped Digital Commerce 360 derive its Amazon Prime Day sales estimates:\nConsumer spending up on Amazon during Prime Day\nAccording to figures from a Numerator panel, Prime Day shoppers\u2019 spending on the site went up in 2023. The firm derives its insights from purchasing patterns on the Amazon platform. For the full 48-hour period, the average order value registered $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\nUS Ecommerce: Poised for Takeoff? Insights from Digital Commerce 360\nNumerator data is based on 98,462 Prime Day orders placed through Amazon and spanning 34,185 unique households as well as a survey of more than 4,200 verified buyers.\nOutside of Amazon, sales weren\u2019t so rosy. Salesforce says non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second, with average discounts dropping to 18% this year compared to 30% last year.\u00a0According to the Commerce Cloud provider, discounting was higher during the 4th of July period, peaking at 25% on the holiday.\nStill, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, according to Adobe Analytics. The insights arm of technology company Adobe Inc. said U.S. ecommerce sales hit $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data of 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites and 100 million SKUs.\nAmazon said the first day of the sales event marked its largest single-day sales ever.\nMerchants weigh in\nAndrey Klen is pleased with how things went for his company on Amazon.com during Prime Day this year. The co-founder and chief marketing officer of Petcube said \u201cPrime Day performed much better in comparison to the previous year. Compared to an average day, we\u2019ve seen a double-digit multiple on sales. We were able to beat optimistic high growth projections on our main product.\u201d\nKlen said sales numbers suggest that shoppers were excited about Prime Day this year and had planned purchases of Petcube products well in advance of the two-day sales event.\n\u201cWe had lower conversion a couple of days prior to Prime Day, followed by the massive explosion for the first hours on the date. Most likely, people were adding the products to the cart beforehand,\u201d Klen said.\nThrasio Holdings Inc., an investment company that has purchased a number of Amazon merchants, said some of its brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\u201cThese were the two most profitable days in Thrasio history,\u201d Thrasio CEO\u00a0Greg Greeley said in a written statement.\nThrasio\u2019s latest acquisition \u2014 a seller of insect-repellent spray called Ranger Ready Repellents \u2014 had a record-breaking day on Amazon and tripled its Prime Day 2022 sales.\nDo you rank in our databases?\nSubmit your data\u00a0and we\u2019ll see where you fit in our next ranking update.\nSign up\nStay on top of the latest developments in the ecommerce industry.

This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors.

Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience.

By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia. The company has made significant investments in online marketplaces in Southeast Asia, such as Lazada, where Alibaba invested $4 billion. This investment has allowed Alibaba to gain a strong foothold in the Southeast Asian market and expand its global reach.\nAdditionally, Alibaba has acquired e-commerce sites like Daraz in South Asia, made investments in companies like Tokopedia in Indonesia and Paytm in India, and partnered with MegaFon and Russia\u2019s Mail.Ru Group to establish AliExpress Russia. These moves highlight Alibaba\u2019s commitment to expanding its presence in key markets and capitalizing on the growth opportunities they offer.\nCompetitive analysis also plays a crucial role in Alibaba\u2019s global expansion strategy. By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

Alibaba\u2019s secure payment options and stringent quality control measures contribute to its reputation as a reliable partner.\nFounder Jack Ma\u2019s significant recognition and popularity have also played a crucial role in building Alibaba\u2019s brand image. His entrepreneurial journey and success have made him a household name, further enhancing the company\u2019s credibility.\nAlibaba\u2019s brand positioning has enabled it to surpass retail giants like Walmart in global sales and achieve the world\u2019s biggest IPO in 2014. Today, the company holds a place within the global top 10 market cap.\nTo support its brand positioning, Alibaba has expanded its operations into major global markets, allowing it to reach a larger customer base. The company\u2019s presence in nearly 240 countries worldwide is a testament to its global dominance.\nTo visually represent Alibaba\u2019s brand positioning, the image below showcases the company\u2019s logo, embodying trust, innovation, and credibility:\nIn conclusion, Alibaba has successfully positioned itself as a trusted and innovative brand through strategic online advertising campaigns.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Amazon nears $13 billion in Prime Day sales\nAmazon boosted its overall Prime Day sales to record numbers, but growth is slowing. Consumers worldwide spent nearly $13 billion with Amazon.com Inc. during the retail giant\u2019s ninth-annual Prime Day, according to an early Digital Commerce 360 analysis. This year\u2019s two-day sale marked yet another record-breaking event, with a 6.7% year-over-year increase to $12.90 billion globally during the event on July 11 and 12, 2024. This is up from $12.09 billion in 2022 and $11.19 billion in 2021.\n\nPrime Day 2021 fell less than a year after the 2020 sales event, which contributed to the slowdown in growth from 45.1% earlier in the pandemic. The pandemic impacted retailers\u2019 supply chains and inventory, shifted consumers\u2019 shopping priorities, and led more shoppers to Amazon.com to purchase essential items.\n\nThis year, shoppers purchased more than 375 million items worldwide during the 2023 event, up from 300 million last year. The average order value was $54.05, up 3.4% from $52.26 during Prime Day 2021. Nearly a fifth of households placed five or more orders during the two-day period.\n\nOther retailers saw a smaller Prime Day bump in traffic this year compared to last year. For example, Target Corp. grew traffic 26.9% this year compared to 42.3% last year. Costco Wholesale Corp. saw a bump of 16.7% this year compared to 24.6% last year. Best Buy Co. saw its bump drop to 51.2% from 85.0% last year. Walmart saw its change in traffic grow by half, up to 24.9% from 16.7%.\n\nSales outside of Amazon weren\u2019t as strong. Salesforce reported non-Amazon sales in the U.S. were down 10% year over year for the first day of the sales holiday and down 7% on the second. However, overall U.S. ecommerce spending was up 6.1% for the Prime Day period, hitting $12.7 billion for the two days, a new Prime Day record based on Adobe Analytics data.\n\nMerchants like Petcube and Thrasio Holdings Inc. reported significant sales increases during Prime Day. Petcube saw a double-digit multiple on sales compared to an average day, and Thrasio\u2019s brands had their best days ever during the event.\n\nIn summary, Amazon's Prime Day 2024 had a significant impact on total revenue in July 2024, with nearly $13 billion in sales, marking a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Other retailers experienced mixed results, with some seeing smaller traffic increases and others reporting declines in sales.",

    "Document1": "Ebay Marketing Strategy 2024: A Case Study\nIn recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. With a strong focus on customer experience, innovative partnerships, and global expansion, eBay has seen impressive revenue growth and user engagement. In this case study, we will delve into eBay\u2019s marketing approach and examine the key strategies that have contributed to its continued success.\nKey Takeaways:\nWith its impressive financial performance, eBay\u2019s marketing strategy serves as a testament to its ability to adapt and thrive in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In the following sections, we will explore the various facets of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, providing insights and key learnings for businesses looking to enhance their own strategies.\nExamining eBay\u2019s Revenue Model\neBay, one of the world\u2019s leading online marketplaces, operates on a revenue model that incorporates various sources of income. By understanding how eBay generates revenue, we can gain valuable insights into its business strategy and success.\nAt the core of eBay\u2019s revenue model are listing fees and commissions on sales. For every listing, eBay charges a fee of $0.35, following a free limit of 200 products. This scalable approach enables sellers to list their products while generating revenue for the platform. Additionally, eBay earns a commission on sales through a Final Value Fee, which is a percentage of the final sale price, and an additional charge of $0.30 per order.\nAside from listing fees and commissions, eBay also generates revenue through advertising. Sellers have the option to pay advertising fees to promote their products on the platform, providing them with increased visibility and sales opportunities. This advertising revenue stream further supports eBay\u2019s commitment to creating a thriving marketplace for its sellers.\nOver the years, eBay has expanded its revenue streams through strategic acquisitions. Notable acquisitions such as PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have not only diversified eBay\u2019s revenue but also strengthened its position in the market. These acquisitions have allowed eBay to tap into new markets and revenue sources, further fueling its growth and success.\nWith over 19 million sellers worldwide and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay\u2019s revenue model has proven to be highly effective. It has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, with over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s revenue model, combined with its wide reach and diverse product offerings, has contributed to its impressive financial performance.\nTake a look at the table below for a snapshot of eBay\u2019s revenue statistics:\nWith its successful revenue model and ongoing innovations, eBay continues to solidify its position in the e-commerce industry. The platform\u2019s dedication to providing sellers with a profitable marketplace and buyers with a wide range of products ensures sustainable growth and long-term success.\neBay\u2019s Marketing Approach \u2013 Beyond Online Car Boot Sales\neBay, initially known as AuctionWatch, revolutionized the e-commerce industry when it was founded in 1995 by computer programmer Pierre Omidyar. What started as a platform for online auctions has evolved into much more. Omidyar\u2019s vision extended beyond a simple auction site; he aimed to create an online community that fostered democratic decision-making, decentralized operations, and open communication.\nDespite its success, eBay has faced challenges in recent years. To overcome the perception of being just an \u201conline car boot sale,\u201d the company has shifted its marketing approach. One significant strategy is investing in traditional media advertising, particularly television. eBay recognizes that traditional media is still a powerful channel for brand building and reshaping consumer perceptions.\nThe decision to invest in traditional media advertising aligns with eBay\u2019s goal of reasserting its unique selling position as the site where buyers and sellers can find anything. By utilizing television ads, eBay has the opportunity to reach a wider audience and showcase the diverse range of products available on the platform.\nAlthough digital marketing platforms have gained prominence, traditional media advertising provides eBay with an advantage. While digital ads can be effective in targeting specific audiences, traditional media appeals to a broader demographic. This broader reach allows eBay to engage with potential buyers and sellers who may not be as active online.\nFurthermore, traditional media advertisements can have a lasting impact on brand recall and recognition. Television commercials, in particular, enable eBay to convey its message visually and emotionally, creating a memorable connection with the audience.\nBy diversifying its marketing approach beyond online advertising, eBay aims to broaden its appeal and attract new users. Additionally, by leveraging traditional media, eBay can address the perception that it is inconvenient compared to more streamlined platforms like Amazon and Facebook.\nDespite the challenges eBay faces, its commitment to brand building through traditional media demonstrates its determination to remain a dominant player in the e-commerce industry. Through television advertisements and other traditional media channels, eBay is actively reshaping consumer perceptions and reviving its brand.\n\nImage alt tag: eBay marketing approach\nLeveraging Social Media for Promotion\nSocial media has become an integral part of people\u2019s lives, offering a powerful platform for businesses to promote their products and services. Recognizing the immense potential of social media, eBay has implemented a program to incentivize sellers to leverage social media platforms for promotion.\nThe eBay social media promotion program provides sellers with the opportunity to reduce their fees for successful sales generated through social links. By actively promoting their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, sellers can reach a broader audience and increase their chances of making sales.\nWith 98% of digital consumers being active on social media and 74% of people trusting social media when making purchasing decisions, it is evident that social sharing plays a significant role in driving sales and brand visibility. By encouraging sellers to utilize social media as a promotional tool, eBay aims to enhance the visibility of listings and attract potential buyers.\nThis initiative has proven to be successful, with a notable increase in sales resulting from social media promotion. As a result, eBay plans to expand this program to other markets worldwide, allowing sellers from different regions to benefit from this incentivized social sharing approach.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with influencers on platforms like Instagram has also contributed to increased visibility and sales. With over a billion monthly active users on Instagram and influencer posts generating an average engagement rate of 3.21%, leveraging the reach and influence of social media influencers has become an effective marketing strategy.\n\nSocial Media: A Game Changer for eBay\nSocial media has transformed the way businesses promote and sell their products, and eBay is leveraging this trend to enhance its visibility and drive sales. By incentivizing sellers to promote their listings on social media platforms, eBay is tapping into a vast audience and creating new opportunities for sellers to succeed.\nCollaborations and Influencer Marketing\neBay recognizes the immense power of influencer marketing and the impact it can have on driving brand awareness and increasing product visibility. In an effort to tap into this growing trend, eBay has ventured into exciting collaborations, including a groundbreaking partnership with the hit reality TV show Love Island.\nLove Island, with its massive viewership of 3.2 million during the live final in 2021, offers a great opportunity for eBay to reach a wide audience and promote their commitment to sustainability in the fashion industry. As a new sponsor of Love Island, eBay has taken on the responsibility of replacing fast fashion brands with a focus on second-hand clothing and encouraging viewers to embrace pre-loved fashion.\nThis collaboration enables eBay to leverage the influence of Love Island contestants and popular influencers to advocate for sustainable fashion choices. By working with influencers and bloggers, eBay can enhance its brand awareness and credibility, as well as drive traffic and conversions to their platform.\nThrough collaborations with influencers, eBay can tap into their loyal following on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. By partnering with these individuals, eBay can harness their influence to establish long-term relationships with their target audience, as well as foster trust and credibility.\nProduct reviews, giveaways, and content collaborations are some of the key strategies used in influencer marketing. Influencers not only provide valuable reviews of eBay products, but they also promote specific actions from their audience, such as engaging with the brand or making a purchase, in exchange for free merchandise.\neBay\u2019s collaborations and influencer marketing efforts are driven by the goal of raising brand awareness and increasing reach. As more than 75% of marketing professionals plan to invest in influencer marketing, eBay is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and achieve their marketing objectives.\nEbay Collaborations with Love Island Contestants\nIn the Love Island collaboration, eBay has partnered with contestants who have a significant influence on social media. These collaborations involve contestants creating and sharing content on their platforms, showcasing their personal style through second-hand clothing and promoting eBay\u2019s range of pre-loved fashion items.\nThis strategic partnership not only benefits eBay by increasing brand visibility, but it also aligns with the rising popularity of pre-loved clothing apps like Vinted, Depop, and Hardly Ever Worn. By associating with Love Island and sustainable fashion choices, eBay can appeal to a broader audience seeking more ethical and environmentally friendly options.\nFurthermore, eBay\u2019s collaboration with Love Island contestants and influencers is not limited to the duration of the show. It\u2019s a long-term relationship-building approach, establishing authenticity and trust among the audience. The ongoing engagement helps eBay maintain a strong presence in the minds of their target market, leading to increased conversions and higher customer satisfaction.\nAs eBay continues to innovate and explore new avenues for collaboration and influencer marketing, they remain committed to their overarching goals of sustainability, brand awareness, and credibility.\nUsing Legacy Media for Marketing\nWhile digital advertising dominates the marketing landscape, eBay understands the enduring power of legacy media in reaching a wide audience. One such medium that eBay has leveraged effectively is television advertising.\nTelevision remains a formidable platform for brand building and shaping consumer perceptions. With its broad reach and ability to captivate audiences, TV advertising allows eBay to communicate its key messages to a diverse range of potential buyers.\nDespite the rise of digital channels, TV advertising continues to play a significant role in eBay\u2019s marketing strategy. By utilizing legacy media like TV, eBay can complement its digital efforts and extend its reach to a wider audience.\neBay\u2019s decision to incorporate TV advertising into its marketing mix is supported by its success in other areas. For example, eBay\u2019s promoted listings revenue increased by an impressive 27% to $276 million, outpacing GMV growth by more than 30 points. This achievement demonstrates the effectiveness of eBay\u2019s marketing approach, which combines digital advertising with legacy media.\nMoreover, eBay\u2019s transition from display advertising to promoted listings and CPC ads has yielded positive results, especially when compared to its legacy third-party display ads. While eBay faced industry-wide headwinds with its legacy third-party display ads, these ads represent a smaller portion of its overall advertising mix.\neBay\u2019s emphasis on legacy media like TV advertising is part of its broader marketing strategy to diversify sales channels and reach target audiences effectively. By utilizing both digital and traditional advertising platforms, eBay can leverage its buying intent signals, shopping insights, and transaction-level data to connect brands with their ideal customers.\nAs a testament to the success of eBay\u2019s marketing efforts, over 2 million sellers utilized at least one ad product in Q4, and eBay has over 800,000 sellers promoting over 200 million listings. Promoted listings on eBay have provided sellers with an average boost in visibility of 36% and led to impressive year-over-year revenue growth of 110%.\nAlthough digital advertising has gained significant traction, eBay\u2019s strategic use of legacy media, particularly TV advertising, ensures the company\u2019s marketing efforts are comprehensive and well-rounded. By incorporating legacy media into its marketing mix, eBay continues to connect with a wide range of buyers and create meaningful brand experiences.\neBay\u2019s Approach to Inventory Sourcing\neBay provides sellers with a unique opportunity to expand their product selection through inventory sourcing from government agencies. This enables sellers to find a wide range of unique and in-demand items that can attract buyers and drive sales.\nWith over 1.5 billion listings on the eBay platform and 154 million active buyers worldwide, sellers need to stand out from the competition. Sourcing inventory from government agencies allows sellers to offer products that may not be readily available elsewhere, giving them a competitive edge.\nGovernment agencies often have surplus items or products seized in legal cases that they need to sell. These items can include electronics, vehicles, clothing, and much more. By partnering with government agencies, eBay sellers can access these items and offer them to buyers on the platform.\nWhen sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers should consider the following:\neBay\u2019s extensive buyer base and powerful search algorithm prioritize relevant results from top sellers. By sourcing inventory from government agencies, sellers can offer unique products that align with the needs and interests of eBay\u2019s diverse community of buyers.\nBy leveraging eBay\u2019s inventory sourcing from government agencies, sellers can enhance their product range, attract more buyers, and increase sales on the platform. It\u2019s an excellent strategy for sellers looking to differentiate themselves and offer unique products that meet the diverse needs of eBay\u2019s global community.\nBest Practices for Customer Service\neBay, with its bustling marketplace and millions of buyers and sellers, understands the crucial role that customer service plays in building trust and cultivating repeat business relationships. Implementing best practices for customer service can lead to enhanced customer satisfaction, improved sales conversion rates, and increased buyer loyalty.\nAccurate Handling Times and Uploading Tracking Information\nStatistics show that providing accurate handling times and uploading tracking information can significantly reduce \u201citem not received\u201d claims, improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. By promptly shipping orders and providing tracking details, sellers can create a positive shopping experience and instill confidence in buyers.\nGenerous Returns Policy\nResearch indicates that having a generous returns policy can increase sales conversion rates. Shoppers are more likely to purchase items when they know they can be returned if needed. By offering hassle-free returns, sellers demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction and build trust with buyers.\nClear and Accurate Product Listings\nData suggests that clear and accurate product listings, including detailed descriptions and high-quality images, can reduce buyer dissatisfaction and lead to fewer return requests. Sellers should provide comprehensive information about their products, ensuring that buyers have a clear understanding of what they are purchasing.\nRequiring Immediate Payment\nStudies have shown that requiring immediate payment for listings helps prevent unpaid items and reduces the likelihood of payment disputes. This streamlined buying process benefits both sellers and buyers, allowing transactions to be completed smoothly and efficiently.\nPromptly Managing Buyers\u2019 Requests and Resolving Disputes\nAnalytics demonstrate that efficiently managing buyers\u2019 requests and resolving disputes promptly can enhance customer satisfaction levels and cultivate repeat business relationships. By addressing buyer inquiries and issues in a timely manner, sellers demonstrate their dedication to providing excellent customer service.\nExceptional customer service is key on eBay. Promptly responding to inquiries, offering hassle-free return policies, and providing transparent updates on order status can foster trust and loyalty with buyers. By prioritizing customer satisfaction and communication, sellers can differentiate themselves and establish a positive reputation on the platform.\neBay provides various selling tools for free to help sellers manage and promote listings, track sales performance, and analyze customer behavior. Leveraging these tools can assist sellers in delivering exceptional customer service and making dynamic strategy adjustments based on customer insights.\nCultivating a positive seller reputation through responsive communication, transparency, and issue resolution further helps establish trust with buyers. Sellers should strive to provide accurate and helpful information, address buyer concerns promptly, and proactively resolve any issues that may arise.\nBy cross-promoting related listings and encouraging additional sales, sellers can leverage eBay\u2019s platform to their advantage. This strategy not only increases customer interest but also strengthens customer loyalty by offering a seamless shopping experience.\nFurthermore, with mobile shopping on the rise, it is crucial for sellers to ensure that their listings are mobile-friendly. Responsive designs, fast loading speeds, and targeted promotions for mobile users can enhance the shopping experience and drive sales.\nIn conclusion, implementing best practices for customer service is essential for success on eBay. By prioritizing accurate handling times, clear and accurate product listings, prompt communication, and efficient dispute resolution, sellers can enhance customer satisfaction, build buyer loyalty, and foster long-term success on the platform.\neBay Marketing Grants and Support\neBay understands the challenges faced by entrepreneurs and small businesses, and that\u2019s why they have developed the eBay Up & Running Grants program. Now in its 5th year, this program aims to provide vital support to sellers on the platform, empowering them to grow their businesses and achieve long-term success.\nThrough the eBay Up & Running Grants program, 50 U.S. eBay sellers are rewarded with $10,000 each. But it doesn\u2019t stop there. Recipients also receive a stipend of $500 to invest in office technology from eBay Refurbished, as well as continued education support. These resources are designed to provide sellers with the tools they need to thrive in the competitive online marketplace.\nThe impact of these grants is undeniable. Last year, 90% of awardees found the grant extremely or very helpful, and an astounding 90% also felt more confident about the future of their businesses. The grants have allowed recipients to take their operations to the next level, whether it\u2019s expanding their product range, optimizing their marketing strategies, or investing in employee development.\nOne example of the transformative power of the eBay Up & Running Grant is Easetrade LLC. Thanks to the grant, this small business experienced a remarkable 405% increase in operations and reach, demonstrating the significant positive impact that eBay grants can have on entrepreneurs and their ventures.\nIt\u2019s clear that eBay is committed to supporting small businesses and fostering entrepreneurship. In 2023, eBay\u2019s gross merchandise volume exceeded an incredible $73 billion, and they are now awarding more than $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses through the eBay Up & Running Grant program.\nSellers in the U.S. still have the opportunity to apply for an Up & Running Grant until June 7, 2024, at 6:00 p.m. ET.

These grants provide a valuable stepping stone for small businesses to overcome financial barriers and take their operations to new heights.\nFurthermore, eBay understands that marketing is key to success on their platform. That\u2019s why they offer a range of marketing tools and support for sellers. eBay Stores subscribers have the option to showcase their listings in a customizable eBay Store, giving them access to advanced design, marketing, and reporting tools.\nPromoted Listings is another powerful marketing tool offered by eBay, allowing sellers to increase their visibility on the platform. With Promoted Listings, sellers only pay when an ad leads to a sale. Meanwhile, Seller Hub Promotions enables sellers to create customized discounts and coupons to motivate buyers and increase conversion rates.\neBay Stores subscription also provides exclusive marketing features and customization options to help sellers build a strong brand for customer retention. Promoted Listings Standard can further boost inventory visibility by up to 30% with premium placements on high-traffic eBay pages.\nTo optimize their listings, sellers can utilize Search Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques to attract more buyers. By using appropriate words and phrases in their listings, sellers can improve their discoverability and attract a wider audience.\neBay also offers a suite of tools to help sellers manage their businesses effectively. Seller Hub provides valuable tools, including alerts, performance tracking, and sales and traffic reports. This allows sellers to stay informed, make data-driven decisions, and improve their overall performance on the platform.\nMarketplace Research by Terapeak is another invaluable resource offered by eBay.

By focusing on customer acquisition, market segmentation, and brand positioning, Alibaba has established a dominant presence in the e-commerce landscape. With its comprehensive approach, the company excels in both the B2B and B2C markets, catering to businesses of all sizes and individual consumers.\nOne of the key factors behind Alibaba\u2019s success is its digital marketing solutions, which include SEO, online advertising, and social media marketing.

The company\u2019s innovative tactics, such as the annual November 11 sale, have played a significant role in generating record-breaking revenues. In fact, Alibaba earned $14.3 billion (\u20ac13.45 billion) revenue in just 24 hours, making it the highest revenue gained in one shopping day worldwide.\nUnder the visionary leadership of CEO Daniel Zhang, Alibaba continues to thrive. With over 24,000 employees in 70 offices worldwide, the company remains committed to its mission of reaching over 500 million consumers in 200 countries.\nKey Takeaways:\nAlibaba\u2019s Dominance in E-commerce\nWhen it comes to e-commerce, Alibaba is a force to be reckoned with. This multinational conglomerate has carved out a dominant position in both the B2B and B2C markets, solidifying its e-commerce dominance in China and beyond.\nAlibaba\u2019s success can be attributed to its customer-centric approach, placing the needs of users at the heart of its strategy. By creating a user-friendly platform, Alibaba has been able to attract and retain a large user base, offering them a seamless shopping experience.\nIn 2014, Alibaba went public with a staggering 83% market share in China\u2019s e-commerce market. Since then, the landscape has changed with the rise of competitors like Pinduoduo and JD.com. However, Alibaba has managed to maintain a significant market share, currently standing at 39.5%. While its market share has decreased, it is still a force to be reckoned with.\nAlibaba\u2019s continuous growth is fueled by its strong performance in the B2B and B2C sectors. One of its key strengths is its well-integrated supply chain, which allows for efficient operations and reduced costs. Moreover, Alibaba\u2019s Chinese e-commerce unit, Taobao & Tmall Group, experienced a 4% growth in revenue during the fourth quarter, demonstrating its resilience in a competitive market.\nTo enhance user experience and stay ahead of the competition, Alibaba focuses on improved product discovery tools and personalized recommendations. This customer-centric approach ensures that users find exactly what they\u2019re looking for, keeping them engaged and satisfied.\nMarket Share Comparison\nExamining the market share landscape, we can see that while Alibaba\u2019s share has decreased, it still maintains a significant lead over its competitors.

Meanwhile, JD.com has remained stable within the range of 16-18%.\nAs Alibaba continues to navigate the ever-changing e-commerce landscape, it faces competition not only from domestic players but also from global giants like Temu and SHEIN. However, Alibaba\u2019s strong brand positioning and global expansion efforts, including its focus on the US market, give it a competitive edge.\nAll in all, Alibaba\u2019s dominance in e-commerce is a result of its customer-centric approach, user-friendly platform, and continuous efforts to enhance the overall shopping experience.

By forging strategic partnerships and making strategic investments, Alibaba has extended its reach beyond China, aiming to capture new markets and compete with major players like Amazon.\nOne key strategy Alibaba employs in its global expansion is forming strategic partnerships with established brands and companies. For instance, Tmall Luxury Pavilion, launched in 2017, has attracted 80 luxury brands, including Burberry and Versace, to sell their products directly to Chinese consumers. This strategic partnership has allowed Alibaba to tap into the luxury market and cater to the increasing demand for high-end goods in China.\nAnother important aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is its focus on connecting small and medium-sized brands from around the world with Alibaba customers in China. Through Taobao Global, Alibaba partners with these brands, providing them with access to a massive consumer base in China, while also bringing a diverse range of products to Chinese consumers.\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not limited to China or Asia.

By analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of its competitors, such as Amazon and eBay, Alibaba can identify areas for improvement and innovation. This competitive analysis allows Alibaba to stay ahead in the global e-commerce landscape and navigate the challenges posed by regional competitors.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Global Expansion\nAlibaba\u2019s global expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory hurdles related to foreign investments, e-commerce, and data privacy pose obstacles that Alibaba must navigate and overcome. Furthermore, competition from global players like Amazon and regional competitors requires Alibaba to invest significantly in customer support and innovation.\nAnother crucial aspect of Alibaba\u2019s global expansion is adapting its strategies to local markets and consumer preferences. Navigating cultural differences is vital for Alibaba to succeed in new markets and ensure its strategies resonate with local consumers.\nIn summary, Alibaba\u2019s global expansion efforts have been driven by strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and investments in key markets. With its presence in 150 countries, Alibaba is successfully competing with major players in the e-commerce industry. By conducting comprehensive competitive analysis and adapting to local markets, Alibaba continues to expand its global footprint and stay ahead in the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce.\nAlibaba\u2019s Brand Positioning\nAlibaba, a global leader in e-commerce, has strategically positioned itself as a trusted and reliable brand through innovative online advertising campaigns.

    "Summarized_Document1": "In recent years, eBay has implemented a comprehensive marketing strategy to drive its success and maintain its position as a leading online marketplace. This case study delves into eBay\u2019s marketing approach, examining key strategies that have contributed to its continued success. eBay\u2019s revenue model incorporates listing fees, commissions on sales, and advertising revenue. The platform charges a $0.35 fee per listing after a free limit of 200 products and earns a commission through a Final Value Fee and an additional $0.30 per order. Advertising fees from sellers further support eBay\u2019s revenue. Strategic acquisitions like PayPal, Rent.com, Skype, and StubHub have diversified eBay\u2019s revenue streams and strengthened its market position. With over 19 million sellers and more than 1 billion active listings, eBay has established itself as the world\u2019s second most visited online marketplace, boasting over 182 million active users globally. eBay\u2019s marketing approach has evolved beyond its initial auction-based model. The company has invested in traditional media advertising, particularly television, to reshape consumer perceptions and reach a broader audience. This strategy aims to reassert eBay\u2019s unique selling position as a diverse marketplace. Traditional media advertising complements digital marketing by appealing to a wider demographic and enhancing brand recall. eBay\u2019s social media promotion program incentivizes sellers to promote their listings on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, reducing fees for successful sales generated through social links. This initiative has led to increased sales and visibility, with plans to expand globally. Collaborations with influencers and reality TV shows like Love Island have further boosted eBay\u2019s brand awareness and commitment to sustainability. eBay\u2019s use of legacy media, such as television advertising, remains a significant part of its marketing strategy. This approach has proven effective, with promoted listings revenue increasing by 27% to $276 million. eBay\u2019s marketing efforts combine digital and traditional advertising to reach a wide audience and create meaningful brand experiences. eBay also offers sellers opportunities to source inventory from government agencies, providing unique and in-demand items that attract buyers. Best practices for customer service, such as accurate handling times, generous returns policies, and clear product listings, enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. The eBay Up & Running Grants program supports small businesses with financial assistance and educational resources. In 2023, eBay awarded over $500,000 in grants and education resources to small businesses. eBay\u2019s international expansion and shipping solutions enable sellers to reach buyers in over 200 countries, reducing risks and costs associated with global transactions. Continuous improvement and seller education are key to success on eBay. The platform provides valuable resources and tools to help sellers optimize their performance and stay ahead of the competition. eBay\u2019s marketing strategy has been instrumental in its success, combining traditional and digital channels to reach its target audience and build a strong reputation. The company\u2019s commitment to customer satisfaction, social media promotion, influencer collaborations, and international expansion positions it for continued growth in the e-commerce industry.",

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "1 Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about new challenges for educators as learning in many school districts has transitioned from in-person instruction to distance learning models that include combinations of in-person instruction and virtual learning. As a result, educators are faced with implementing new learning models and may be required to implement multiple models concurrently. To meet the academic, physical, social, and emotional needs of students, teachers must include supports offered by other professionals within their school or district in planning and implementation of distance learning. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, including the key features of each, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of how other professionals can be included to support student learning.

Hyflex learning is a modality of teaching that presents the components of hybrid or blended learning in a flexible course structure that gives students the option of attending sessions in the classroom, participating online, or doing both. \u2022 Characterized by the flexibility of attendance modes. \u2022 Lends itself more to synchronous learning. \u2022 Students can participate either face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning), at the time, place, and pace of the student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning), or both. \u2022 Technology is used to provide real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. Blended What is blended learning? Blended learning is modality of teaching where students learn via electronic and online media as well as traditional face-to-face teaching. \u2022 Combines face-to-face instruction and online instruction. \u2022 Lends itself more to asynchronous learning. \u2022 Students attend a partial schedule of face-to-face classes (synchronous learning). \u2022 Technology is used to deliver additional content, facilitate learning activities, communicate with students, house resources and learning materials, and serve as a portal for receiving and returning assignments. \u2022 The online learning is done at the time, place, and pace of student\u2019s choosing (asynchronous learning). 2 Terminology Cloud storage2: An Internet-based computing model that allows you to store, manage, and share files online. Popular cloud storage-based platforms include Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive. Learning management system (LMS)3: A platform used to deploy and track online training. Uploaded content to the LMS is accessible for both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette4: The appropriate online social behavior. Click on the link for a resource that will help you get a sense of ways to provide this learning to your students. Student response tool5: A tool that is used to receive real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning6: Two types of online learning formats. Synchronous learning activities occur in real-time with participants actively participating in the same online environment. Asynchronous learning does not occur in real-time; it includes learning and activities that students can complete on their own schedule. Video conferencing7: A technology that allows users in different locations to hold face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Pratices for Hybrid Learning While many pedagogical practices for hyflex and blended learning are similar, there are some key differences as hyflex depends on live instruction and blended relies on both recorded and live instruction. Because hyflex instruction relies more heavily on synchronous learning, formative assessments can include the use of real-time student response tools. Conversely, the more asynchronous nature of the blended learning model does not lend itself to the regular use of these tools. The companion documents, Rethinking the Classroom for Hyflex Learning and Rethinking the Classroom for Blended Learnning, outline and describe these common pedagogical practices for virtual learning.

The move from in-person instruction to online instruction does not eradicate the need for students to socialize, engage in physical activity, or access the services of social workers, counselors, nurses, paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, librarians, and others. Within both hyflex and blended learning models there are many opportunities to support instruction and build community by giving students a chance to connect with and interact with other professionals in your school. Consider: \u2713 Asking your librarian/media specialist19 to help choose resources to support learning goals, lead book talks, or engage with families to select extracurricular reading materials. \u2713 Asking the physical education teacher20 for recommendations for short physical breaks during online instruction. \u2713 Asking appropriate specialized instruction support personnel21 (SISP*) and/or education support professionals 22 (ESPs**) to lead sessions on health and safety, social and emotional well-being, grief and loss, coping with stress, good hygienic practices, nutrition, bus safety, and other topics. \u2713 Asking paraeducators23, content area specialists, or instructional coaches24 to collaborate on supporting and differentiating asynchronous learning tasks and/or joining synchronous online sessions to support student learning. \u2713 Collaborating with arts and music educators on activities and projects that provide ways to demonstrate knowledge through the arts25. *SISP as defined in the Every Student Succeeds Act (2015) include: school counselors, school social workers, and school psychologists; and other qualified professional personnel, such as school nurses, speech language pathologists, and school librarians, involved in providing assessment, diagnosis, counseling, educational, therapeutic, and other necessary services (including related services as that term is defined in section 602 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401) as part of a comprehensive program to meet student needs. **ESPs include school support staff working in nine career families: clerical services, custodial and maintenance services, food services, health, and student services, paraeducators, security services, skilled trades, technical services, transportation services. 4 RESOURCES: 1 \u201cWhat is Hybrid Learning?\u201d (2020).

    "Summarized_Document2": "Hybrid Learning Models The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced new challenges for educators, transitioning many school districts from in-person instruction to distance learning models, including hybrid combinations of in-person and virtual learning. Educators must implement these new models to meet students' academic, physical, social, and emotional needs, often requiring collaboration with other professionals within their school or district. This resource provides an overview of different learning models, key features, terminology, common pedagogical practices, and examples of professional support for student learning. Hyflex Learning Hyflex learning offers a flexible course structure allowing students to attend sessions in the classroom, participate online, or both. It is characterized by flexible attendance modes and lends itself more to synchronous learning. Students can participate face-to-face or online in real-time (synchronous learning) or at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology is used for real-time online instruction, recorded instruction, learning activities, communication, and assignment management. Blended Learning Blended learning combines face-to-face instruction with online instruction, lending itself more to asynchronous learning. Students attend partial face-to-face classes (synchronous learning) and complete online learning at their own pace (asynchronous learning). Technology delivers additional content, facilitates learning activities, communicates with students, and manages resources and assignments. Terminology Cloud storage: Internet-based computing model for storing, managing, and sharing files online. Learning management system (LMS): Platform for deploying and tracking online training, accessible to both face-to-face and remote learners. Netiquette: Appropriate online social behavior. Student response tool: Tool for receiving real-time, formative feedback on student understanding. Synchronous and asynchronous learning: Synchronous learning occurs in real-time with active participation, while asynchronous learning occurs on the student's schedule. Video conferencing: Technology for face-to-face meetings using video, audio, messaging, and other interactive capabilities. Common Pedagogical Practices for Hybrid Learning Hyflex and blended learning share many pedagogical practices, but key differences exist. Hyflex relies more on synchronous learning, using real-time student response tools, while blended learning's asynchronous nature does not. Practices include accommodating learning styles, active learning strategies, collaborative learning, differentiated instruction, flipped classroom model, partner/group activities, peer-to-peer interaction, project-based learning, short recorded lessons, and video communication.

Hyflex and blended learning models offer opportunities to support instruction and build community by connecting students with other professionals. Consider involving librarians/media specialists, physical education teachers, specialized instruction support personnel (SISP), education support professionals (ESPs), paraeducators, content area specialists, instructional coaches, and arts and music educators in supporting student learning.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

Well, the numbers don\u2019t lie. With 55% of high school students crushing it above a 3.0 GPA and 40% of college scholars soaring past 3.5, it\u2019s a GPA gala out there. But fret not if you find yourself among the 15% at the other end of the spectrum \u2013 after all, it\u2019s all about the journey, not just the digits. Dive into the pool of California GPA stats and let\u2019s see where you fit in this scholarly buffet!\nAverage GPA\nInterpretation\nIn California, GPAs seem to be as varied as the state's landscape. From the informal scholars at community colleges boasting a respectable 2.8 to the ivory-tower denizens of law schools with a lofty 3.8, the state's students are clearly charting their own academic paths. Whether you're a high school senior riding the wave at 3.1 or a medical school student reaching for the stars at 3.9, one thing is clear: there's a GPA for every stripe of Californian student, just like there's a beach for every surfer. So, whether you're cruising the wave of academia at a public school's 2.9 or soaring on the wings of knowledge at a university's 3.4, remember that in the Golden State, the only limit to your GPA is the height of your ambition.\nPercentage with GPA above 30\nInterpretation\nIn a state where sunshine and tacos are abundant, it seems that high GPAs are also in good supply. With 55% of high school students, 60% of community college students, and 45% of public school students boasting a GPA above 3.0, California is clearly a hotbed of academic achievement. Could it be the avocado toast fueling their success or perhaps the ocean breeze enhancing their brain power? Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure\u2014these golden state students are acing the grade game with style.\nPercentage with GPA above 35\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems that a GPA above 3.5 is the new black - trendy, desirable, yet somewhat elusive. With statistics showing that a significant portion of college students, private school students, and university students are sporting this academic badge of honor, one can't help but wonder if the remaining 60% are simply too busy enjoying California's sunny weather to bother with GPAs. As for the 35% of high school seniors hitting that coveted GPA mark, they're the true unicorns of the California academic landscape, balancing the pressures of college applications with the allure of the Golden State dream. So, whether you're hitting the books in a university lecture hall or soaking up the sun on a beach, remember that a GPA above 3.5 is the Californian equivalent of a golden ticket - a fashionable accessory for any ambitious scholar.\nPercentage with GPA above 37\nInterpretation\nIn California, having a GPA above 3.7 seems to be as elusive as finding parking in Los Angeles\u2014it's a premium commodity! With 40% of graduate students achieving this academic feat, it's clear that higher education in the Golden State is not for the faint-hearted. So, if you're feeling average with your GPA, just remember, you're in good company with the other 60% navigating the treacherous waters of academia.\nPercentage with GPA above 40\nInterpretation\nIn California, it seems the pursuit of higher education is no mere walk in the park\u2014it's a sprint up a steep GPA mountain. With 60% of law school students and a whopping 70% of medical school students boasting GPAs above 3.9, it's clear that the academic arena is not for the faint of heart. Perhaps these students have truly mastered the art of balancing textbooks on one hand and a latte in the other, or maybe they've simply discovered the secret formula for extracting every last drop of knowledge from their lectures. Whatever the case may be, it's safe to say that the competition in California's educational landscape is as fierce as a warring faction of overachievers armed with highlighters and flashcards.\nPercentage with GPA below 30\nInterpretation\nCalifornia's GPA statistics paint a colorful picture of academic achievement in the Golden State. From high school to college, it seems that a certain percentage of students are keeping it real with their GPA scores that are, well, let's just say not exactly knocking it out of the park. As we navigate the maze of percentages and grade point averages, one thing is clear - in the diverse landscape of education in California, there's room for improvement and a touch of academic honesty sprinkled with a dash of reality check. So, whether you're a high school senior struggling to hit that 3.0 mark or a university student toeing the GPA line, remember that numbers don't define you - but they do make for an interesting statistic or two!\nPercentage with GPA below 35\nInterpretation\nCalifornia seems to pride itself on being a state of high achievers, but with 15% of graduate students and law school students wielding GPAs below 3.5, it appears that even in the land of sunshine there are a few clouds lingering over academic performance. Perhaps these individuals are the rebels without a cause, challenging the status quo and proving that success doesn't always come neatly packaged with a shiny GPA. Or maybe they're just the ones who make sure the curve stays interesting for the rest of us.\nPercentage with GPA below 37\nInterpretation\nIn a world where grades seemingly hold the key to success, the statistic that 10% of California medical school students have a GPA below 3.7 is a gentle reminder that brilliance doesn't always fit neatly into a numerical box. Perhaps these aspiring healers are the rebels, the visionaries, the ones unafraid to color outside the lines of academic perfection. After all, the heart of a healer is measured not in GPA points, but in empathy, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to care for those in need.\nPercentage with GPA between 25 and 30\nInterpretation\nIt seems that in the grand academic dance of California, a significant number of students are hitting that sweet spot of mediocrity, proudly sporting a GPA between 2.5 and 3.0. It's as if they've mastered the art of navigating the treacherous waters of academia without fully sinking or soaring. Whether they're the ultimate balance-seekers or just expert fence-sitters, these students prove that sometimes, it's okay to be comfortably average amidst the high-pressure world of education.\nPercentage with GPA between 30 and 35\nInterpretation\nIn a world where GPAs are as carefully curated as Instagram feeds, these statistics paint a vivid picture of academic diversity in California. From high school hallways to university lecture halls, the spectrum of student achievement spans from the solidly satisfactory 2.5 to the upper echelons of 3.5. With private school students holding their own in the 3.0-3.5 range and public school seniors making their mark, it's clear that Californian scholars are carving their own paths to success. So whether you're a high school overachiever or a college trendsetter, remember that your GPA is just one part of your story \u2013 but hey, a little extra credit never hurt anyone.\nPercentage with GPA between 35 and 40\nInterpretation\nIn the academic jungle of California, where the GPA reigns supreme, we see a hierarchy emerging among graduate students. It appears that law school students are the ambitious overachievers, with a quarter boasting GPAs between 3.5 and 3.9, while medical school students come in a close second, as 20% strut around with GPAs of 3.7 to 3.9. Meanwhile, the general graduate student population languishes in the middle, with only a humble 25% scraping by with GPAs between 3.5 and 3.7. It seems the battle for the highest grades is not just fought in the classroom but also on the academic battlefield of California.\nReferences\ned-data.org\nppic.org\nedsource.org\nkcra.com\ncollegesimply.com\ncollegecalc.org\nsacbee.com\nriceinstitute.org\nexercise.science.unlv.edu\ncollegefactual.com\ncsusm.edu\nmtsac.edu\namportel.cl\ngreatschools.org\nnces.ed.gov\ndatastories.com\nedweek.org\ncapradio.org\ncollegeboard.org\ngradschools.com\ncsupomona.edu\ngrad.usc.edu\nucdavisgradlaw.wordpress.com\nlaw.syr.edu\nlaw.gwu.edu\nlsac.org\nlaw.berkeley.edu\nadmissions.usc.edu\nkeck.usc.edu\nuarizona.co1.qualtrics.com\nuclahealth.org\nAlexander Eser\nCo-Founder\nWorldmetrics.org provides comprehensive market data and statistics to help you make informed decisions.\nOur Commitment to Accuracy\nExplore More In This Category\nOur Most Popular Topics\nWorldmetrics.org\nHow we make money\nWe want to use our data to help our readers make important decisions.

    "Document2": "ARTICLE Online vs in-person learning in higher education: effects on student achievement and recommendations for leadership Bandar N. Alari\ufb011\u2709& Steve Song2 This study is a comparative analysis of online distance learning and traditional in-person education at King Saud University in Saudi Arabia, with a focus on understanding how different educational modalities affect student achievement. The justi\ufb01cation for this study lies in the rapid shift towards online learning, especially highlighted by the educational changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing the \ufb01nal test scores of freshman students in \ufb01ve core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years, the research provides empirical insights into the ef\ufb01cacy of online versus traditional edu-cation. Initial observations suggested that students in online settings scored lower in most courses. However, after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores using multiple linear regression, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the crucial need for a nuanced, data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems. It brings to light the fact that the success of educational methodologies is highly contingent on speci\ufb01c contextual factors. This \ufb01nding advocates for educational administrators and policymakers to exercise careful and informed judgment when adopting online learning modalities. It encourages them to thoroughly evaluate how different subjects and instructional approaches might interact with online formats, considering the variable effects these might have on learning outcomes. This approach ensures that decisions about implementing online edu-cation are made with a comprehensive understanding of its diverse and context-speci\ufb01c impacts, aiming to optimize educational effectiveness and student success.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 OPEN 1 Department of Sports and Recreation Management, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. 2 Division of Research and Doctoral Studies, Concordia University Chicago, 7400 Augusta Street, River Forest, IL 60305, USA. \u2709email: balari\ufb01@ksu.edu.sa HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he year 2020 marked an extraordinary period, character-ized by the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments and institutions worldwide had to adapt to unforeseen challenges across various domains, including health, economy, and education. In response, many educational institutions quickly transitioned to distance teaching (also known as e-learning, online learning, or virtual classrooms) to ensure continued access to education for their students. However, despite this rapid and widespread shift to online learning, a compre-hensive examination of its effects on student achievement in comparison to traditional in-person instruction remains largely unexplored.\nIn research examining student outcomes in the context of online learning, the prevailing trend is the consistent observation that online learners often achieve less favorable results when compared to their peers in traditional classroom settings (e.g., Fischer et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017; Edvardsson and Oskarsson, 2008). However, it is important to note that a sig-ni\ufb01cant portion of research on online learning has primarily focused on its potential impact (Kuhfeld et al., 2020; Azevedo et al., 2020; Di Pietro et al., 2020) or explored various perspectives (Aucejo et al., 2020; Radha et al., 2020) concerning distance education. These studies have often omitted a comprehensive and nuanced examination of its concrete academic consequences, particularly in terms of test scores and grades.\nGiven the dearth of research on the academic impact of online learning, especially in light of Covid-19 in the educational arena, the present study aims to address that gap by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person teaching in \ufb01ve required freshmen-level courses at King Saud University, Saudi Arabia. To accomplish this objective, the current study compared the \ufb01nal exam results of 8297 freshman students who were enrolled in the \ufb01ve courses in person in 2020 to their 8425 \ufb01rst-year counterparts who has taken the same courses at the same institution in 2021 but in an online format.\nThe \ufb01nal test results of the \ufb01ve courses (i.e., University Skills 101, Entrepreneurship 101, Computer Skills 101, Computer Skills 101, and Fitness and Health Culture 101) were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors such as gender, class size and admission scores, which have been cited in past research to be correlated with student achievement (e.g., Meinck and Brese, 2019; Jepsen, 2015) Additionally, as the preparatory year at King Saud University is divided into \ufb01ve tracks\u2014health, nursing, science, business, and humanity, the study classi\ufb01ed students based on their respective disciplines.\nMotivation for the study The rapid expansion of distance learning in higher education, particularly highlighted during the recent COVID-19 pandemic (Volk et al., 2020; Bettinger et al., 2017), underscores the need for alternative educational approaches during crises. Such disrup-tions can catalyze innovation and the adoption of distance learning as a contingency plan (Christensen et al., 2015). King Saud University, like many institutions worldwide, faced the challenge of transitioning abruptly to online learning in response to the pandemic.\nE-learning has gained prominence in higher education due to technological advancements, offering institutions a competitive edge (Valverde-Berrocoso et al., 2020). Especially during condi-tions like the COVID-19 pandemic, electronic communication was utilized across the globe as a feasible means to overcome barriers and enhance interactions (Bozkurt, 2019).\nDistance learning, characterized by \ufb02exibility, became crucial when traditional in-person classes are hindered by unforeseen circumstance such as the ones posed by COVID-19 (Arkorful and Abaidoo, 2015). Scholars argue that it allows students to learn at their own pace, often referred to as self-directed learning (Hiemstra, 1994) or self-education (Gadamer, 2001). Additional advantages include accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and \ufb02exibility (Sadeghi, 2019).\nHowever, distance learning is not immune to its own set of challenges.\nTechnical impediments, encompassing network issues, device limitations, and communication hiccups, represent formidable hurdles (Sadeghi, 2019). Furthermore, concerns about potential distractions in the online learning environment, fueled by the ubiquity of the internet and social media, have surfaced (Hall et al., 2020; Ravizza et al., 2017). The absence of traditional face-to-face interactions among students and between students and instructors is also viewed as a potential drawback (Sadeghi, 2019).\nGiven the evolving understanding of the pros and cons of distance learning, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning, speci\ufb01cally in terms of student achievement, as compared to in-person classroom learning at King Saud University, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest higher education institutions.\nAcademic achievement: in-person vs online learning The primary driving force behind the rapid integration of tech-nology in education has been its emphasis on student perfor-mance (Lai and Bower, 2019). Over the past decade, numerous studies have undertaken comparisons of student academic achievement in online and in-person settings (e.g., Bettinger et al., 2017; Fischer et al., 2020; Iglesias-Pradas et al., 2021). This section offers a concise review of the disparities in academic achievement between college students engaged in in-person and online learning, as identi\ufb01ed in existing research.\nA number of studies point to the superiority of traditional in-person education over online learning in terms of academic outcomes. For example, Fischer et al. (2020) conducted a com-prehensive study involving 72,000 university students across 433 subjects, revealing that online students tend to achieve slightly lower academic results than their in-class counterparts.\nSimilarly, Bettinger et al. (2017) found that students at for-pro\ufb01t online universities generally underperformed when compared to their in-person peers. Supporting this trend, Figlio et al. (2013) indicated that in-person instruction consistently produced better results, particularly among speci\ufb01c subgroups like males, lower-performing students, and Hispanic learners.\nAdditionally, Kaupp\u2019s (2012) research in California community colleges demonstrated that online students faced lower completion and success rates compared to their traditional in-person counterparts (Fig. 1).\nIn contrast, other studies present evidence of online students outperforming their in-person peers. For example, Iglesias-Pradas et al. (2021) conducted a comparative analysis of 43 bachelor courses at Telecommunication Engineering College in Malaysia, revealing that online students achieved higher academic out-comes than their in-person counterparts. Similarly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gonzalez et al. (2020) found that students engaged in online learning performed better than those who had previously taken the same subjects in traditional in-class settings.\nExpanding on this topic, several studies have reported mixed results when comparing the academic performance of online and in-person students, with various student and instructor factors emerging as in\ufb02uential variables. Chesser et al. (2020) noted that student traits such as conscientiousness, agreeableness, and extraversion play a substantial role in academic achievement, ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 2 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 regardless of the learning environment\u2014be it traditional in-person classrooms or online settings. Furthermore, Cacault et al.\n(2021) discovered that online students with higher academic pro\ufb01ciency tend to outperform those with lower academic cap-abilities, suggesting that differences in students\u2019 academic abilities may impact their performance. In contrast, Bergstrand and Savage (2013) found that online classes received lower overall ratings and exhibited a less respectful learning environment when compared to in-person instruction. Nevertheless, they also observed that the teaching ef\ufb01ciency of both in-class and online courses varied signi\ufb01cantly depending on the instructors\u2019 back-grounds and approaches. These \ufb01ndings underscore the multi-faceted nature of the online vs. in-person learning debate, highlighting the need for a nuanced understanding of the factors at play.\nTheoretical framework. Constructivism is a well-established learning theory that places learners at the forefront of their educational experience, emphasizing their active role in con-structing knowledge through interactions with their environment (Duffy and Jonassen, 2009). According to constructivist princi-ples, learners build their understanding by assimilating new information into their existing cognitive frameworks (Vygotsky, 1978). This theory highlights the importance of context, active engagement, and the social nature of learning (Dewey, 1938).\nConstructivist approaches often involve hands-on activities, problem-solving tasks, and opportunities for collaborative exploration (Brooks and Brooks, 1999).\nIn the realm of education, subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emerges as a vital perspective that acknowledges the distinctive nature of different academic disciplines (Shulman, 1986). It suggests that teaching methods should be tailored to the speci\ufb01c characteristics of each subject, recognizing that subjects like mathematics, literature, or science require different approaches to facilitate effective learning (Shulman, 1987). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy emphasizes that the methods of instruction should mirror the ways experts in a particular \ufb01eld think, reason, and engage with their subject matter (Cochran-Smith and Zeichner, 2005).\nWhen applying these principles to the design of instruction for online and in-person learning environments, the signi\ufb01cance of adapting methods becomes even more pronounced. Online learning often requires unique approaches due to its reliance on technology, asynchronous interactions, and potential for reduced social presence (Anderson, 2003). In-person learning, on the other hand, bene\ufb01ts from face-to-face interactions and immediate feedback (Allen and Seaman, 2016). Here, the interplay of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy becomes evident.\nOnline learning. In an online environment, constructivist principles can be upheld by creating interactive online activities that promote exploration, re\ufb02ection, and collaborative learning (Salmon, 2000). Discussion forums, virtual labs, and multimedia presentations can provide opportunities for students to actively engage with the subject matter (Harasim, 2017). By integrating subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy, educators can design online content that mirrors the discipline\u2019s methodologies while leveraging technology for authentic experiences (Koehler and Mishra, 2009).\nFor instance, an online history course might incorporate virtual museum tours, primary source analysis, and collaborative time-line projects.\nIn-person learning. In a traditional brick-and-mortar class-room setting, constructivist methods can be implemented through group activities, problem-solving tasks, and in-depth discussions that encourage active participation (Jonassen et al., 2003). Subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy complements this by shaping instructional methods to align with the inherent characteristics of the subject (Hattie, 2009). For instance, in a physics class, hands-on experiments and real-world applications can bring theoretical concepts to life (Hake, 1998).\nIn sum, the fusion of constructivism and subject-speci\ufb01c pedagogy offers a versatile approach to instructional design that adapts to different learning environments (Garrison, 2011). By incorporating the principles of both theories, educators can tailor their methods to suit the unique demands of online and in-person learning, ultimately providing students with engaging and effective learning experiences that align with the nature of the subject matter and the mode of instruction.\nCourse description The Self-Development Skills Department at King Saud University (KSU) offers \ufb01ve mandatory freshman-level courses. These courses aim to foster advanced thinking skills and cultivate sci-enti\ufb01c research abilities in students. They do so by imparting essential skills, identifying higher-level thinking patterns, and facilitating hands-on experience in scienti\ufb01c research. The design of these classes is centered around aiding students\u2019 smooth transition into university life. Brief descriptions of these courses are as follows: University Skills 101 (CI 101) is a three-hour credit course designed to nurture essential academic, communication, and Fig. 1 Comparison of Final Exam Results for the Five Courses Mandatory Freshman Courses in King Saud University by Year (2020 and 2021). The \ufb01gure compared student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, using independent-samples t-tests; the results show a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nHUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 ARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 3 personal skills among all preparatory year students at King Saud University. The primary goal of this course is to equip students with the practical abilities they need to excel in their academic pursuits and navigate their university lives effectively. CI 101 comprises 12 sessions and is an integral part of the curriculum for all incoming freshmen, ensuring a standardized foundation for skill development.\nFitness and Health 101 (FAJB 101) is a one-hour credit course.\nFAJB 101 focuses on the aspects of self-development skills in terms of health and physical, and the skills related to personal health, nutrition, sports, preventive, psychological, reproductive, and \ufb01rst aid. This course aims to motivate students\u2019 learning process through entertainment, sports activities, and physical exercises to maintain their health. This course is required for all incoming freshmen students at King Saud University.\nEntrepreneurship 101 (ENT 101) is a one-hour- credit course.\nENT 101 aims to develop students\u2019 skills related to entrepre-neurship. The course provides students with knowledge and skills to generate and transform ideas and innovations into practical commercial projects in business settings. The entrepreneurship course consists of 14 sessions and is taught only to students in the business track.\nComputer Skills 101 (CT 101) is a three-hour credit course.\nThis provides students with the basic computer skills, e.g., com-ponents, operating systems, applications, and communication backup. The course explores data visualization, introductory level of modern programming with algorithms and information security. CT 101 course is taught for all tracks except those in the human track.\nComputer Skills 102 (CT 102) is a three-hour credit course. It provides IT skills to the students to utilize computers with high ef\ufb01ciency, develop students\u2019 research and scienti\ufb01c skills, and increase capability to design basic educational software. CT 102 course focuses on operating systems such as Microsoft Of\ufb01ce.\nThis course is only taught for students in the human track.\nStructure and activities. These courses ranged from one to three hours. A one-hour credit means that students must take an hour of the class each week during the academic semester. The same arrangement would apply to two and three credit-hour courses.\nThe types of activities in each course are shown in Table 1.\nAt King Saud University, each semester spans 15 weeks in duration. The total number of semester hours allocated to each course serves as an indicator of its signi\ufb01cance within the broader context of the academic program, including the diverse tracks available to students. Throughout the two years under study (i.e., 2020 and 2021), course placements (fall or spring), course content, and the organizational structure remained consistent and uniform.\nData Participants. The study\u2019s data comes from test scores of a cohort of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students enrolled at King Saud Uni-versity in Saudi Arabia over the span of two academic years: 2020 and 2021. Among these students, 8297 were engaged in tradi-tional, in-person learning in 2020, while 8425 had transitioned to online instruction for the same courses in 2021 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2020, the student population consisted of 51.5% females and 48.5% males. However, in 2021, there was a reversal in these proportions, with female students accounting for 48.5% and male students comprising 51.5% of the total participants.\nRegarding student enrollment in the \ufb01ve courses, Table 2 provides a detailed breakdown by average class size, admission scores, and the number of students enrolled in the courses during the two years covered by this study. While the total number of students in each course remained relatively consistent across the two years, there were noticeable \ufb02uctuations in average class sizes.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, four out of the \ufb01ve courses experienced substantial increases in class size, with some nearly doubling in size (e.g., ENT_101 and CT_102), while one course (CT_101) showed a reduction in its average class size.\nIn this study, it must be noted that while some students enrolled in up to three different courses within the same academic year, none repeated the same exam in both years. Speci\ufb01cally, students who failed to pass their courses in 2020 were required to complete them in summer sessions and were consequently not included in this study\u2019s dataset. To ensure clarity and precision in our analysis, the research focused exclusively on student test scores to evaluate and compare the academic effectiveness of online and traditional in-person learning methods. This approach was chosen to provide a clear, direct comparison of the educational impacts associated with each teaching format.\nMethods. Descriptive analysis of the \ufb01nal exam scores for the two years (2020 and 2021) were conducted. Additionally, comparison of student outcomes in in-person classes in 2020 to their online platform peers in 2021 were conducted using an independent-samples t-test. Subsequently, in order to address potential Table 1 Learning activities and total course hours per semester.\nLearning Activities Courses Lecture Laboratory Total Semester Hours CT_101 50% 50% 45 CT_102 50% 50% 45 ENT_101 100% 0% 15 FAJB_101 100% 0% 15 CI_101 100% 0% 45 CI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nTable 2 Class size, gender distribution, and admission scores by courses in 2020 and 2021.\nCourses Average Class Size Gender Distribution Admission Scores 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 FAJB 101 23.1 46.1 M = 53.8%, F = 46.2% M = 58.3%, F = 41.7% 89.58 87.95 CI 101 21.6 35.2 M = 54%, F = 46% M = 58%, F = 42% 89.57 87.96 ENT 101 33.7 66.7 M = 68.1%, F = 31.9% M = 69.7%, F = 30.3% 87.94 90.19 CT 101 42.7 22.3 M = 62.7%, F = 37.3% M = 64.2%, F = 35.8% 90.84 88.22 CT 102 21.1 46.5 M = 51.4%, F = 48% M = 57%, F = 43% 87.85 86.85 Source: Deanship of Admission and Registration Affairs at King Saud University.\nCI_101 University Skills 101, CT_101 Computer Skills 101, CT_102 Computer Skills 102, ENT_101 Entrepreneurship 101, FAJB_101 Fitness and Health 101.\nARTICLE HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 4 HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:86 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-023-02590-1 disparities between the two groups arising from variables such as gender, class size, and admission scores (which serve as an indicator of students\u2019 academic aptitude and pre-enrollment knowledge), multiple regression analyses were conducted. In these multivariate analyses, outcomes of both in-person and online cohorts were assessed within their respective tracks. By carefully considering essential aforementioned variables linked to student performance, the study aimed to ensure a comprehensive and equitable evaluation.\nStudy instrument. The study obtained students\u2019 \ufb01nal exam scores for the years 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) from the school\u2019s records of\ufb01ce through their examination management system. In the preparatory year at King Saud University, \ufb01nal exams for all courses are developed by committees composed of faculty members from each department. To ensure valid com-parisons, the \ufb01nal exam questions, crafted by departmental committees of professors, remained consistent and uniform for the two years under examination.\nTable 3 provides a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of all \ufb01ve tests included in our analysis. These tests exhibit a strong degree of internal consistency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha coef\ufb01cients spanning a range from 0.77 to 0.86. This robust and consistent internal consistency measurement underscores the dependable nature of these tests, af\ufb01rming their reliability and suitability for the study\u2019s objectives.\nIn terms of assessing test validity, content validity was ensured through a thorough review by university subject matter experts, resulting in test items that align well with the content domain and learning objectives. Additionally, criterion-related validity was established by correlating students\u2019 admissions test scores with their \ufb01nal required freshman test scores in the \ufb01ve subject areas, showing a moderate and acceptable relationship (0.37 to 0.56) between the test scores and the external admissions test. Finally, construct validity was con\ufb01rmed through reviews by experienced subject instructors, leading to improvements in test content. With guidance from university subject experts, construct validity was established, af\ufb01rming the effectiveness of the \ufb01nal tests in assessing students\u2019 subject knowledge at the end of their coursework.\nCollectively, these validity and reliability measures af\ufb01rm the soundness and integrity of the \ufb01nal subject tests, establishing their suitability as effective assessment tools for evaluating students\u2019 knowledge in their \ufb01ve mandatory freshman courses at King Saud University.\nProcedure. After obtaining research approval from the Research Committee at King Saud University, the coordinators of the \ufb01ve courses (CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101) supplied the researchers with the \ufb01nal exam scores of all \ufb01rst-year preparatory year students at King Saud University for the initial semester of the academic years 2020 and 2021. The sample encompassed all students who had completed these \ufb01ve courses during both years, resulting in a total of 16,722 students forming the \ufb01nal group of participants.\nLimitations. Several limitations warrant acknowledgment in this study. First, the research was conducted within a well-resourced major public university. As such, the experiences with online classes at other types of institutions (e.g., community colleges, private institutions) may vary signi\ufb01cantly. Additionally, the limited data pertaining to in-class teaching practices and the diversity of learning activities across different courses represents a gap that could have provided valuable insights for a more thor-ough interpretation and explanation of the study\u2019s \ufb01ndings.\nFindings To compare student achievement in the \ufb01nal tests in the \ufb01ve courses by year, independent-samples t-tests were conducted.\nTable 4 shows a statistically-signi\ufb01cant drop in test scores from 2020 (in person) to 2021 (online) for all courses except CT_101.\nThe biggest decline was with CT_102 with 3.58 points, and the smallest decline was with CI_101 with 0.18 points.\nHowever, such simple comparison of means between the two years (via t-tests) by subjects does not account for the differences in gender composition, class size, and admission scores between the two academic years, all of which have been associated with student outcomes (e.g., Ho and Kelman, 2014; De Paola et al., 2013). To account for such potential confounding variables, multiple regressions were conducted to compare the 2 years\u2019 results while controlling for these three factors associated with student achievement.\nTable 5 presents the regression results, illustrating the variation in \ufb01nal exam scores between 2020 and 2021, while controlling for gender, class size, and admission scores.

Conversely, in the case of ENT_101, online students in 2021 scored 0.69 points lower than their 2020 in-person counterparts. With CT_102, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant differences in \ufb01nal exam scores between the two cohorts of students.\nDiscussion The study sought to assess the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning in the higher education setting in Saudi Arabia. We analyzed the \ufb01nal exam scores of 16,722 \ufb01rst-year college students in King Saud University in \ufb01ve required subjects (i.e., CI_101, ENT_101, CT_101, CT_102, and FAJB_101). The study initially performed a simple comparison of mean scores by tracks by year (via t-tests) and then a number of multiple regression analyses which controlled for class size, gender composition, and admission scores.\nOverall, the study\u2019s more in-depth \ufb01ndings using multiple regression painted a wholly different picture than the results obtained using t-tests. After controlling for class size, gender composition, and admissions scores, online students in 2021 performed better than their in-person instruction peers in 2020 in University Skills (CI_101), Fitness and Health (FAJB_101), and Computer Skills (CT_101), whereas in-person students out-performed their online peers in Entrepreneurship (ENT_101).\nThere was no meaningful difference in outcomes for students in the Computer Skills (CT_102) course for the two years.\nIn light of these \ufb01ndings, it raises the question: why do we observe minimal differences (less than a one-point gain or loss) in student outcomes in courses like University Skills, Fitness and Health, Entrepreneurship, and Advanced Computer Skills based on the mode of instruction? Is it possible that when subjects are primarily at a basic or introductory level, as is the case with these courses, the mode of instruction may have a limited impact as long as the concepts are effectively communicated in a manner familiar and accessible to students?\nIn today\u2019s digital age, one could argue that students in more developed countries, such as Saudi Arabia, generally possess the skills and capabilities to effectively engage with materials pre-sented in both in-person and online formats. However, there is a notable exception in the Basic Computer Skills course, where the online cohort outperformed their in-person counterparts by more than 5 points. Insights from interviews with the instructors of this course suggest that this result may be attributed to the course\u2019s basic and conceptual nature, coupled with the availability of instructional videos that students could revisit at their own pace.\nGiven that students enter this course with varying levels of computer skills, self-paced learning may have allowed them to cover course materials at their preferred speed, concentrating on less familiar topics while swiftly progressing through concepts they already understood. The advantages of such self-paced learning have been documented by scholars like Tullis and Ben-jamin (2011), who found that self-paced learners often outper-form those who spend the same amount of time studying identical materials. This approach allows learners to allocate their time more effectively according to their individual learning pace, providing greater ownership and control over their learning experience.

Instead, it may be more about exposure to and digestion of materials in a format and at a pace tailored to stu-dents with diverse backgrounds, knowledge levels, and skill sets.\nFurther investigation is needed to more fully understand why some classes bene\ufb01tted from online instruction while others did not, and vice versa. Perhaps, it could be posited that some content areas are more conducive to in-person (or online) format while others are not. Or it could be that the different results of the two modes of learning were driven by students of varying academic abilities and engagement, with low-achieving students being more vulnerable to the limitations of online learning (e.g., Kofoed et al., 2021). Whatever the reasons, the results of the current study can be enlightened by a more in-depth analysis of the various factors associated with such different forms of learning. Moreover, although not clear cut, what the current study does provide is additional evidence against any dire consequences to student learning (at least in the higher ed setting) as a result of sudden increase in online learning with possible bene\ufb01ts of its wider use being showcased.\nBased on the \ufb01ndings of this study, we recommend that edu-cational leaders adopt a measured approach to online learning\u2014a stance that neither fully embraces nor outright denounces it. The impact on students\u2019 experiences and engagement appears to vary depending on the subjects and methods of instruction, sometimes hindering, other times promoting effective learning, while some classes remain relatively unaffected.\nRather than taking a one-size-\ufb01ts-all approach, educational leaders should be open to exploring the nuances behind these outcomes. This involves examining why certain courses thrived with online delivery, while others either experienced a decline in student achievement or remained largely unaffected. By exploring these differentiated outcomes associated with diverse instructional formats, leaders in higher education institutions and beyond can make informed decisions about resource allo-cation. For instance, resources could be channeled towards in-person learning for courses that bene\ufb01t from it, while simul-taneously expanding online access for courses that have demonstrated improved outcomes through its virtual format.\nThis strategic approach not only optimizes resource allocation but could also open up additional revenue streams for the institution.\nConsidering the enduring presence of online learning, both before the pandemic and its accelerated adoption due to Covid-19, there is an increasing need for institutions of learning and scholars in higher education, as well as other \ufb01elds, to prioritize the study of its effects and optimal utilization. This study, which compares student outcomes between two cohorts exposed to in-person and online instruction (before and during Covid-19) at the largest university in Saudi Arabia, represents a meaningful step in this direction.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reason-able request.\nReceived: 7 June 2023; Accepted: 21 December 2023; References Allen IE, Seaman J (2016) Online report card: Tracking online education in the United States.

    "Summarized_Document2": "This study compares online and in-person learning at King Saud University, focusing on the impact on student achievement. The research analyzed final test scores of 16,722 freshman students in five core courses over the 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online) academic years. Initial observations indicated lower scores for online students, but after adjusting for variables like gender, class size, and admission scores, a more nuanced picture emerged. Three courses showed better performance in the 2021 online cohort, one favored the 2020 in-person group, and one was unaffected by the teaching format. The study emphasizes the need for a data-driven strategy in integrating online learning within higher education systems, considering the variable effects on learning outcomes.The study's motivation stems from the rapid shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for alternative educational approaches. Distance learning offers flexibility, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness but also faces challenges like technical issues and potential distractions. The study aims to contribute to the existing literature by assessing the effectiveness of distance learning compared to in-person learning at King Saud University.Theoretical frameworks of constructivism and subject-specific pedagogy were applied to understand the differences in learning environments. Constructivism emphasizes active learning and context, while subject-specific pedagogy tailors teaching methods to the characteristics of each subject. These principles were used to design instruction for both online and in-person learning environments.The study's data comes from test scores of 16,722 first-year students at King Saud University over two academic years: 2020 (in-person) and 2021 (online). The final exam results of five courses were examined, accounting for potential confounding factors like gender, class size, and admission scores. Descriptive analysis and multiple regression analyses were conducted to compare student outcomes.Findings showed a statistically significant drop in test scores from 2020 to 2021 for all courses except Computer Skills 101. However, after controlling for confounding variables, online students in 2021 performed better in University Skills 101, Fitness and Health 101, and Computer Skills 101, while in-person students outperformed online peers in Entrepreneurship 101. There was no significant difference in outcomes for Computer Skills 102.The study suggests that the mode of instruction may have limited impact on basic or introductory courses, as long as concepts are effectively communicated. The advantages of self-paced learning in online environments were highlighted, particularly for courses like introductory computer skills. The study recommends a measured approach to online learning, exploring the nuances behind different outcomes and optimizing resource allocation based on course-specific needs.In conclusion, the study provides evidence against any dire consequences to student learning due to the shift to online learning, with potential benefits for certain courses. Educational leaders should adopt a strategic approach, considering the specific needs of each course and the potential advantages of online learning.",

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

Average ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US Let's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States. Highest Possible ACT Score The highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score. However, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test. ACT Scores By Percentile ACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category. For example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you. Based on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u2019ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive). However, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile. Overall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time. Are you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies. FAQs If you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs! 1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good? Although a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score. 2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College? While even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness. 3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score? While it\u2019s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application. 4. What Is a Low ACT Score? Like what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low. 5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to? Once your ACT score is released, you\u2019ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant! 6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT? If your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant. 7. What\u2019s the Lowest Possible ACT Score? The lowest ACT score possible is 1. 8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section? The average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc. 9. What is The Average Science ACT Score? The average science ACT score is 20. Final Thoughts Now that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher. If you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

This compensation does not influence our school rankings, resource guides, or other editorially-independent information published on this site.\nAll About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\nWriter\nEditor & Writer\nWriter\nEditor & Writer\nData Summary\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, the majority of them juniors and seniors.Note Reference [1] By comparison, 1.4 million students took the alternative standardized test, the American College Test (ACT), in the same year.\nA growing number of colleges no longer require standardized test scores, including all of the Ivy League schools. However, the SAT remains a common standard, with colleges making score submissions optional rather than completely abandoning the practice.[2], [3]\nThis report outlines key statistics about the SAT, including the national average score, scores broken down by demographic, and average scores among enrollees at top schools.\nTable of Contents\nWhat Is the Average SAT Score?\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016.Note Reference [1]\nDid You Know...\nFrom 2006-2016, the SAT was scored on a 2400-point scale.\nIt returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017.\nThe current average SAT score of 1028 reflects the scores of students who graduated from high school in 2023.\nAverage SAT Scores by State\nThe percentage of high school students who took the SAT differed significantly by state. For example, in Mississippi and North Dakota, only 1% of students took the SAT. In contrast, 100% of students took the SAT in the District of Columbia, and 95% of students in Rhode Island.\nAverage SAT Scores by State, Graduating Class of 2023\nAverage SAT Score by School\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at your top colleges can be helpful when it comes to setting goals. If you've already taken the SAT, you can see how your score compares to the typical scores at some of your top college choices to better understand where you stand in comparison to the previously admitted class.\nCollege admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications. Standardized test scores are just one aspect of an application if they are considered at all.\nDid You Know...\nToday, fewer colleges are requiring standardized test scores for admissions.\nSince the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which schools closed and concerns emerged about whether students had adequate access to testing, colleges became more lax about their testing policies.\nIn September 2019, before the pandemic, more than 1,000 colleges were test-optional. According to the National Center for Fair & Open Testing (FairTest), over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free as of the 2023-2024 application cycle.[6]\nThis means almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions no longer require tests.\nAverage SAT Score for Ivy Leagues\nThe Ivy Leagues are some of the U.S.'s oldest and most prestigious universities. The eight private colleges are all located in the Northeast and are known for their highly selective, single-digit acceptance rates.\nAs of 2022-2023 application cycle, standardized test scores are optional at all Ivy League colleges. The data below reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores.\nAverage SAT Scores for Other Selective Universities\nBelow are average SAT scores for other selective schools throughout the U.S. Many of these schools' average SAT scores are comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\nSAT Score Demographics\nSometimes, it is helpful to see SAT scores broken down by specific groups to notice trends. This section explores average SAT scores by race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income.\nUnderstanding Differences in Average SAT Scores Across Demographics\nWhether the SAT is implicitly biased to favor wealthy and white students has long been a subject of debate. A 2023 study by a team of researchers based at Harvard University, however, was able to back this argument with data. They found that \"Ivy-Plus\" colleges \u2014 a group of 12 highly selective, private schools including the eight Ivy League schools and the University of Chicago, Duke, MIT, and Stanford \u2014 were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to students from low- or middle-income families even when they had comparable test scores.[7]\nIn a class of 1,650 students, there were roughly 114 \"extra students\" from the top 1% despite them having comparable standardized test scores to students of lower income brackets.Note Reference [7] Higher admission rates for these students from high-income families were primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\nGetting a degree from an \"Ivy-Plus\" school can lead to many opportunities. Less than 1% of Americans attend one of these 12 highly selective, private institutions, yet graduates of these schools make up nearly 12% of Fortune 500 CEOs, 25% of current U.S. senators, and over 70% of Supreme Court Justices. By changing admissions practices, \"Ivy-Plus\" institutions could shift the makeup of the country's highest earners and leaders.Note Reference [7]\nStudents largely support changes in admissions practices, including the elimination of legacy-based admissions.\nAverage SAT Score by Race/Ethnicity\nSAT scores broken down by race/ethnicity showed similar trends to those of the ACT.\nAverage SAT Score by Gender\nMen have consistently outscored women in the SAT since 2017. However, women have scored higher on the ERW section every year. Men scored higher on the math section.\nCollege admissions officers consider total SAT scores but also scores by section.\nAverage SAT Score by First Language\nThose who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow four-point margin. In 2022, native English speakers who grew up only speaking English had the highest total SAT score.\nAverage SAT Score by Highest Level of Parental Education\nThe highest level of education that one's parents received appears to heavily influence how students perform on the SAT.\nDid You Know...\nFirst-generation college students \u2014 students whose immediate family members do not have four-year degrees \u2014 make up more than 40% of all college students.\nImposter syndrome can be a common challenge for these students, but getting guidance from academic counselors or professors can help relieve some of that stress.\nIn addition, many schools provide resources, such as academic advising or scholarship opportunities specific to first-generation students. Check with your financial aid office or career center to see what your campus has to offer.\nAverage SAT Score by Family Income\nSAT performance also correlates with family income.\nFrequently Asked Questions About the SAT\nHow many times can you take the SAT?\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT.[8] The organization that administers the SAT, College Board, recommends that students take the test at least twice because many schools \"superscore\" your results. That means they combine your highest math score with your highest ERW score even if they are from different tests.Note Reference [8]\nIt's common for students to take the SAT in the spring of their junior year and another time in the fall of their senior year.\nWhat is the highest SAT score?\nThe math and ERW sections are each 800 points each, making the total possible score 1600.[9] As of January 2021, the optional SAT essay was discontinued, along with SAT subject tests.[10] Your two scores, one from math and one from ERW, make up your total SAT score.\nIs the SAT or ACT easier?\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways. For example, they are both approximately three hours long, and both tests cover reading and math. Some key differences include the number of questions (the ACT has 215 while the SAT has 154) and the scoring scale (the ACT is scored from 1-36 while the SAT is scored from 400-1600).\nAnother major difference is that the ACT has an additional science section that the SAT doesn't have.\nKeeping in mind these differences, you can decide which test is a better fit for you. You can also check the websites of prospective colleges and see if they state which test the majority of their accepted students took.\nReferences\nLatest News\nCampus-GPT: How 2 University of California Campuses Are Designing Their Own Specialized AI Tools\nEmployment of Recent Law School Graduates Hits 10-Year High\nIs Yield Protection Real?\nUNC Greensboro Provides Free Childcare for Student-Parents\nRelated Stories\nWhat Is a Good SAT Score?\nHow Much Does College Cost?

    "Summarized_Document1": "All About SAT Scores: National Average and Full Statistics\n\nMore than 1.9 million high school students took the SAT in 2023, with the majority being juniors and seniors. In comparison, 1.4 million students took the ACT in the same year. Despite a growing number of colleges no longer requiring standardized test scores, the SAT remains a common standard, with score submissions being optional rather than completely abandoned.\n\nThe average total SAT score was 1028 in 2023, the lowest since the test changed formats in 2016. The SAT returned to a 1600-point scale in 2017. The percentage of high school students who took the SAT varied significantly by state, with 100% participation in the District of Columbia and 95% in Rhode Island, compared to only 1% in Mississippi and North Dakota.\n\nKnowing the average SAT scores of enrollees at top colleges can help set goals. College admissions officials typically take a holistic approach to reviewing applications, with standardized test scores being just one aspect. As of the 2023-2024 application cycle, over 1,900 four-year colleges and universities were ACT/SAT-optional or test-free, representing almost 80% of bachelor's degree-granting institutions.\n\nThe Ivy League schools, known for their highly selective acceptance rates, have made standardized test scores optional. The data reflects the scores of accepted students who did submit test scores. Other selective universities in the U.S. have average SAT scores comparable to those of the Ivy Leagues.\n\nSAT scores broken down by demographics show trends across race/ethnicity, gender, first language, highest level of parental education, and family income. A 2023 study by Harvard University found that Ivy-Plus colleges were twice as likely to admit students from the highest-income families compared to those from low- or middle-income families with comparable test scores. This was primarily due to legacy preferences, higher non-academic ratings, and athletic recruitment.\n\nMen have consistently outscored women on the SAT since 2017, with men scoring higher on the math section and women scoring higher on the ERW section. Those who grew up speaking English and another language had the highest total SAT score overall by a narrow margin. The highest level of parental education appears to heavily influence SAT performance, with first-generation college students making up more than 40% of all college students.\n\nThere is no limit to the number of times you can take the SAT. The College Board recommends taking the test at least twice, as many schools superscore results. The highest possible SAT score is 1600, with the math and ERW sections each worth 800 points. The optional SAT essay and subject tests were discontinued in January 2021.\n\nThe ACT and SAT are similar in many ways, but the ACT includes an additional science section. Deciding which test to take depends on individual strengths and the preferences of prospective colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep? Send your parent or guardian our guide to the SAT to get them thinking about the test prep process.\nSAT Percentile Charts by Section\nWe also have data on percentile rankings for score ranges in Reading and Writing\u00a0and Math. Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive.

This guide will teach you all you need to know about ACT scores!\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nIf you want to evaluate how you compare to other test-takers, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll teach you everything you need to know about your scores, including average ACT scores, percentiles, highest ACT scores possible, and much more.\nAverage ACT Scores (2024)\nACT scores range from 1 to 36 in each category (except for writing, out of 12). The average of your four scores determines your ACT composite score. According to ACT Score National Ranks, the average score in each category is:\u00c2\u00a0\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to know how the ACT is scored. \u00c2\u00a0First, the number of questions you got correct in each section is counted and converted to scale scores.\nThe average ACT score is 19.9. These rankings are based on almost 4.5 million \u00e2\u0080\u009cACT-tested high school graduates of 2021, 2022, and 2023.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nThe ACT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website also released score information for students who decided to take the optional writing test, which contributes to an English Language Arts score (ELA). The average writing and ELA scores are 6.2 and 18.3, respectively. Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll only see these scores if you take the ACT optional writing test.\nAverage ACT Scores by State\nBelow is a chart that illustrates the most recent statistics on average ACT scores across various states. An important thing to consider is the proportion of students participating in the exam within each state. For instance, in states where the ACT is mandatory for all high school juniors, the average scores might appear lower due to universal testing.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nAverage ACT Scores for Top-25 Schools in the US\nLet's take a look at the average ACT scores for the top 25 schools in the United States.\nHighest Possible ACT Score\u00c2\u00a0\nThe highest ACT score is 36. The current national average ACT score is 19.9. Achieving a perfect ACT score is no easy feat. To give you some perspective, approximately 5,579 students achieved a perfect ACT score out of over 1.6 million test-takers: only about 0.33% of test-takers get a perfect ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, this doesn't mean achieving the highest ACT score is impossible. Sticking to a consistent study schedule, analyzing questions you get wrong during practice, and consulting helpful ACT guides and materials can better prepare you for the test.\nACT Scores By Percentile\u00c2\u00a0\nACT score percentiles can show you the percentage of students you scored higher than and what percentage scored higher than you. To read the ACT percentile chart below, find a score on either side you want to evaluate, then check the number in the category.\u00c2\u00a0\nFor example, a 23 on the English test places you in the 76th percentile: you scored at or higher than 76% of test-takers, and 24% scored higher than you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\n\u00e2\u0080\u008d\nSource: ACT.org\nBased on the table, you can see that ACT score percentiles tend not to change very much at either end of the spectrum. For example, if you received an ACT Math score of 30, retake the ACT, and score a 32, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only jumped from the 95th to the 97th percentile (which is still impressive).\u00c2\u00a0\nHowever, in the middle of the table is where 1 point, either way, can make a huge difference in your percentile ranking. For instance, if your first composite score is 20 and you retake to get a composite score of 23, this 3-point difference takes you from the 56th to the 72nd percentile.\u00c2\u00a0\nOverall, these percentile rankings show you how you compare to other students but also show how your percentile ranking can dramatically shift if you score on the lower or middle end of the range the first time.\u00c2\u00a0\nAre you unsure how ready you are for the ACT? Take the ACT Readiness Quiz to assess your preparedness, identify strengths, and pinpoint areas for improvement in key subject areas and testing strategies.\nFAQs\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you still have questions about ACT scores, check out these FAQs!\u00c2\u00a0\n1. Is a 17 on the ACT Good?\u00c2\u00a0\nAlthough a \"good ACT score\" is subjective, a 17 on the ACT places you in the 38th percentile: 62% of test-takers scored higher than you. Generally, 17 probably wouldn't be an excellent ACT score.\u00c2\u00a0\n2. How Important Are ACT Scores for College?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile even the College Board states that test scores are not the most important factor for college, colleges use them to compare you objectively to other applicants across different school systems. Generally, ACT scores are important because they show your academic ability and college readiness.\u00c2\u00a0\n3. Can I Get Into Harvard With a 30 ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nWhile it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not impossible, Harvard generally admits students with ACT scores between 33 and 36. However, Harvard is test-optional until at least 2026. You may have a better chance if you retake the ACT or have a really impressive application.\u00c2\u00a0\n4. What Is a Low ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nLike what you would consider a high ACT score, a low ACT depends on your definition of \"low.\" If you consider anything below the 50th percentile as low, the answer is 19 and below. Generally, anything below the 25th percentile (composite score of 15) may be low.\u00c2\u00a0\n5. How Do I Know if I Have a Good ACT Score for Colleges I Want to Apply to?\u00c2\u00a0\nOnce your ACT score is released, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll want to know if your ACT score is competitive for a particular college. You can evaluate class profile data to compare your ACT score to admitted students. Aiming for the top end of the middle 50% range or higher can make you a more competitive applicant!\u00c2\u00a0\n6. I Got My ACT Score: How Do I Know If I Should Retake the ACT?\u00c2\u00a0\nIf your ACT score is lower than the middle 50% range of most schools you want to apply to, you may want to consider retaking the test. Boosting your ACT score can help you become a more competitive applicant.\n7. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Lowest Possible ACT Score?\u00c2\u00a0\nThe lowest ACT score possible is 1.\n8. What is The Average ACT Score for the Writing Section?\nThe average ACT Writing score typically falls between a 6 and 7. This range reflects the national ACT writing score percentiles, based on the latest data released by ACT, Inc.\n9. What is The Average Science ACT Score?\nThe average science ACT score is 20.\nFinal Thoughts\nNow that you know more about average ACT scores, the highest ACT scores, and percentiles, you can evaluate your score in a broader context. If you score a 19 or above on the ACT, you've achieved an average score: scores 30 and higher place you in the 93rd percentile or higher.\u00c2\u00a0\nIf you have your hopes set on an Ivy League school, you should strive for an ACT score in the 30s, preferably 32 or higher. If you want to get the highest ACT score possible of 36, you can do it through training and preparation.\u00c2\u00a0 A good way to go about it is to test your skills with our Free ACT Practice Questions Pop Quiz.

    "Summarized_Document1": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",

Or maybe you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet but want to develop a target score.\nOne of the best ways to understand your SAT scores is to understand your SAT score percentiles. You can learn to maximize your study time, find the biggest score gains, and impress your dream school by understanding percentile rankings. Read on for a guide to maximizing your SAT score\u2014and your college admissions chances\u2014by using SAT score percentiles.\nBonus: Want to get a perfect SAT score? Read our famous guide on how to score a perfect 1600 on the SAT. You'll learn top strategies from the country's leading expert on the SAT, Allen Cheng, a Harvard grad and perfect scorer. No matter your level, you'll find useful advice here - this strategy guide has been read by over 500,000 people.\nRead the 1600 SAT guide today and start improving your score.\nWhat Are SAT Score Percentiles?\nIn addition to the composite score you get on the SAT (i.e., that number between 400 and 1600), you'll get a percentile ranking, ranging from 1 to 99. The SAT gives you a percentile ranking for your overall composite score as well as for each of the two section scores: Reading and Writing and Math.\nYour percentile tells you how you did on the SAT compared with everyone else who took the test. For example, if you got a composite percentile of 76, this means you scored higher than 76% of students on the whole test. If you got a percentile of 47 on the Math section, you did better than 47% of students on SAT Math.\nAn example of an SAT score report with percentiles.(College Board / College Board)\nYour percentile score is not like a grade out of 100. For instance, if you get a percentile of 90, this doesn't mean you got exactly 90% of the questions right. It just means that compared with everyone who took the SAT, you scored higher than 90% of them. (For more info on how the SAT is scored, see our scoring guide.)\nSo, why do percentiles matter? Colleges use percentiles to compare you with other students. If you got, say, an SAT score in the 90th percentile, this would make you competitive for many schools since you scored better than 90% of students nationwide.\nPaying attention to your percentile ranking, as well as your composite score, can give you the best idea of your performance and help you make strategic choices about which colleges to apply to.\nWhat Are the Percentile Ranges for the SAT?\nOK, so you get that percentile rankings are important. But if you haven\u2019t taken the SAT yet or have taken it and plan to retake it, what composite SAT score should you shoot for in order to get a certain percentile ranking?\nLuckily, the College Board releases data about composite scores and matching percentile rankings to help you figure this out. These numbers change slightly from year to year, but we have the most recent info from 2024.\nWe've summarized the SAT percentile ranges, based on students who've taken the exam in the past three school years. \u00a0Just find your score to see your estimated percentile.\nSomething to note about these percentile ranks is that they change the fastest with the middle scores. For example, the difference between 1450 and 1600\u2014the highest possible score\u2014is only 4 percentile points, 96 to 99.\nHowever, the same point gap between 1100 and 1250 has a vast percentile difference\u201461 to 81. This means that if you scored 1100 or lower, increasing your overall composite by just 150 points would give a vast boost to your percentile rank and your admissions competitiveness!\nNeed more help with SAT Prep?

Check out the chart below to see how your scores stack up.\nSource: SAT Understanding Scores 2023\nAgain, note that the ranks change dramatically toward the middle scores: 500 in Reading and Writing is only the 43th percentile, but 600 is 73rd. In other words, a 100-point improvement\u2014which is very manageable with some smart studying\u2014could transform your score from poor to good.\nNote that the Math curve is more competitive near the top than the Reading and Writing curve is. A 760 is in the 96th percentile on Math but in the 99th percentile on Reading and Writing, and a 700 is in the 91st percentile on Math but in the 93rd percentile on Reading and Writing. This means that if you were aiming for the same percentile on both sections, you'd have to get a higher score on Math than you would on Reading and Writing.\nFor more info on SAT scores and rankings, check out our guide to average SAT scores in which we also look at score breakdowns by gender and ethnic group.\nHow Can Knowing Your SAT Percentile Help You?\nWe know that percentiles are important and that, in some cases, a relatively small composite score increase can have a huge effect on your percentile ranking.\nHowever, your target composite score for the colleges you want to apply to is the most important. While percentiles help college admissions officers compare your scores, schools also have their own score ranges that typically don\u2019t change much from year to year.\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search \"[School Name] SAT scores PrepScholar\" on Google to find our Admission Requirements page with its SAT/ACT score ranges and info on GPA ranges and overall competitiveness. For more tips on how to use this strategy (and for a table you can fill out for your specific colleges), see our guide on what a good SAT score is.\nBut what about colleges that are test optional? Our experts explain how SAT scores can still help you get into test optional schools in this article.\nMaximize your study time by setting a personal SAT target score.\nFinally, SAT percentile rankings can be a useful tool for you. Especially if you\u2019re deciding whether or not to retake the SAT, percentiles really help put your SAT scores in context. For example, the difference between your 700 in Reading and Writing and 600 in Math might not seem enormous, but that\u00a0score is in the 93rd percentile, while that Math score is in the 76th percentile. A huge difference!\nThis means you can get more bang for your buck if you focus on the Math section for your retake. Increasing your Math score by 100 points can raise your percentile from 76 to 91. However, raising your Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800, though super impressive, only improves your percentile ranking by 5%.\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean you should ignore Reading and Writing\u2014in fact, a gain of just 50 points would put you in the 99th percentile! But recognizing that you stand to gain more with Math can ultimately help you prioritize your study time better.\nWhat\u2019s Next?\nNow that you know the ins and outs of national SAT percentiles, check out what the average SAT scores are, and take a look at the average SAT scores in your state.\nTrying to figure out your SAT target score? Or maybe you took the SAT but aren't sure whether your score is competitive. Our guide can help you develop a personal SAT target score based on the colleges you're applying to.\nReaching for the stars?

    "Summarized_Document1": "SAT Percentiles and Score Rankings (Updated 2024)\n\nUnderstanding your SAT scores and percentiles is crucial for maximizing your study time and improving your college admissions chances. Percentile rankings, ranging from 1 to 99, indicate how you performed compared to other test-takers. For example, a composite percentile of 76 means you scored higher than 76% of students.\n\nPercentiles are not the same as grades. A 90th percentile score means you scored better than 90% of students, not that you got 90% of the questions right. Colleges use these percentiles to compare applicants. A high percentile can make you competitive for many schools.\n\nThe College Board provides data on composite scores and their corresponding percentiles. For instance, a score of 1450 to 1600 falls within the 96th to 99th percentiles, while a score of 1100 to 1250 ranges from the 61st to 81st percentiles. This means a 150-point increase from 1100 can significantly boost your percentile rank.\n\nPercentile rankings also vary by section. For Reading and Writing, a score of 500 is in the 43rd percentile, while 600 is in the 73rd percentile. In Math, a 760 is in the 96th percentile, but a 700 is in the 91st percentile. This indicates that improving your Math score can have a more significant impact on your overall percentile.\n\nKnowing your SAT percentile can help you decide whether to retake the test and where to focus your study efforts. For example, improving a Math score from 600 to 700 can raise your percentile from 76 to 91, while increasing a Reading and Writing score from 700 to 800 only improves your percentile by 5%.\n\nTo find a college\u2019s SAT score ranges, search for the school's name along with 'SAT scores PrepScholar' to find relevant information. Even for test-optional schools, SAT scores can still enhance your application.\n\nIn summary, understanding and utilizing SAT percentiles can help you set realistic goals, prioritize your study time, and improve your chances of getting into your desired colleges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Students aiming for top engineering schools should be aware of the required GRE scores. Not all engineering programs require the GRE; for instance, some programs at Harvard and MIT do not. The GRE is beneficial for aspiring engineers as it is widely used for admissions. The math section is easier for those with a technical background, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing sections are more challenging. Quantitative scores are more critical for engineering admissions than verbal scores. However, verbal scores still impact the overall GRE score, which is important for top universities.For better chances of admission to top engineering programs, candidates should aim for a Quantitative score between 161-166. An 80th percentile score, according to ETS data for 2019-2020, is a verbal score of 158 and a quantitative score of 162. The average Quantitative score for the top ten engineering programs is 166, while for programs ranked 11 to 50, it is 164. Top engineering schools require Quantitative scores between 164-168.For Mechanical Engineering programs, students should aim for a Quantitative score of 165 and a Verbal score of 150. A GRE score above 320 with 161-166 in Quantitative Reasoning is considered good for engineering schools. A perfect score of 340 is excellent, but scores as low as 320 are still competitive.A good GRE Quantitative Reasoning score for engineering schools is above 161, with 170 being excellent. Similarly, a good Verbal Reasoning score is above 158, with 170 being excellent. GRE prep courses can help improve scores by providing targeted instruction and practice.In summary, for engineering program admissions, focus on achieving high Quantitative scores, but do not neglect the Verbal section. Aim for scores above 320 overall, with Quantitative scores between 161-166 for the best chances at top programs.",

The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health asked a national sample of parents of children in middle and high school about participation in school activities.\nParents reported that over 80% of their middle and high school-age children would participate in at least one type of school activity for the 2018-19 school year, including 52% in sports, 43% in arts activities, and 51% clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) of middle and high school-age children were expected to participate in more than one type of school activity.\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had school participation fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs/other activities; there was little difference between middle and high school fees. In contrast, more students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). When combining participation fees with other expenses such as equipment and travel, the total cost averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs/other activities.\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than they expected. Ten percent of parents felt the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, including three times as many lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000). Only 7% of parents had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees; 19% said they didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were not comfortable making such a request.\nParents reported that 18% of their middle and high school-age children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys than girls (21% vs 15%), and for students from lower-income households (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation cited more often for boys were cost, transportation, and having a job; not being interested in activities was cited more often for girls. Non-participation was three times higher for children of parents who said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost, and nearly twice as high for children of parents who said the cost of school activities is more than they expected.\nHighlights\nImplications\nSchool activities offer an array of benefits to middle and high school students: opportunities to explore different interests, make new friends, hone an existing skill or talent, and develop leadership and teamwork skills. Participation in school activities is linked to higher educational achievement.\nParticipation in school activities is widespread. According to parents responding to this Mott Poll, over 80% of their middle or high school students are participating in a school activity for the 2018-19 school year. These activities range from exploratory options like intramurals sports or afterschool clubs, to higher-intensity options like varsity sports, competition arts groups, or student council.\nMany school activities have a fee to participate, and those fees can be a barrier to participation. Most schools strive to offer a range of activities, including some with no fees; in addition, many schools provide scholarships or waivers to assist students with fees. Despite these efforts, elevated rates of non-participation among lower-income students continues to be a problem, as noted in our earlier reports from 2012, 2015, and 2016.\nIn this Mott Poll, 1 in 6 students (18%) at both the middle and high school level are not participating in any school activities for the 2018-19 school year. The income gap persists, as students from households earning less than $100,000 have twice the level of non-participation as their peers from wealthier households.\nTwo key parent attitudes that may explain some of the discrepancy. Nearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school extracurricular activities is higher than they expected, and 10% of parents said the benefits of school activities are not worth the cost. The children of parents who express either of these attitudes are less likely to participate in school activities.\nParents concerned about cost may not be aware of no-cost activities or knowledgeable about fee waivers. Only 7% of parents who responded to this Mott Poll had ever requested a waiver or scholarship for participation fees. In contrast, nearly one quarter of parents were \u201cmissed opportunities\u201d for assistance: those who didn\u2019t know about waivers (19%) and those who were not comfortable requesting one (5%). School officials can address the ongoing problem of non-participation by informing students and parents about no-cost activities, as well as waivers and scholarship options, and by emphasizing the benefits of school activities to parents who may be hesitant.\nThis Mott Poll also highlights the continuing trend of sports being more expensive than other types of school activities. The average participation fee was substantially higher for sports than for arts or clubs, as was the total cost of participation, with little difference between middle and high school costs. Also concerning are trends over time. A previous report for the 2015-16 school year found an average sports participation fee of $139; that average fee increased to $161 in this current Mott Poll Report, while the average fees for arts and clubs did not increase. The same pattern occurs for total costs. Moreover, no-cost options continue to be less common for sports than for arts and clubs.\nThe higher costs of sports, compared to other activities, may be contributing to the higher level of non-participation among boys. Boys have slightly greater participation in sports activities overall compared to girls (53% vs 49%), and more boys than girls participate in sports only (21% vs 10%). Thus, the disproportionately higher cost of sports may be more likely to impact boys.\nData Source & Methods\nThis report presents findings from a nationally representative household survey conducted exclusively by GfK Custom Research, LLC (GfK), for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital. The survey was administered in October 2018 to a randomly selected, stratified group of parents age 18 and older (n=2,007). Adults were selected from GfK\u2019s web-enabled KnowledgePanel\u00ae that closely resembles the U.S. population. The sample was subsequently weighted to reflect population figures from the Census Bureau. The survey completion rate was 60% among panel members contacted to participate. This report is based on responses from 961 parents who reported on 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\nFindings from the C.S.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) programs, for example, offer hands-on learning experiences for students passionate about these fields.\nSimilarly, programs focusing on music, theater, visual arts, or creative writing can offer skill development and a platform for self-expression for those interested in the arts.\nAcademic and Career Aspirations\nSummer programs can also help students enhance their academic knowledge and explore potential career paths. University-led programs often expose students to college-level coursework and fields of study, providing insights into college life and future academic choices.\nFor students with specific career goals, targeted programs, such as internships in desired industries or workshops led by professionals, can offer valuable insights and networking opportunities.\n\nPractical Considerations\nPractical aspects such as the program\u2019s length, location, and cost are also important. Program durations vary, and choosing one that fits the student\u2019s and family\u2019s schedule is crucial.\u00a0Location is another factor, especially for residential programs or those outside Illinois, as it involves travel and accommodation costs.\u00a0Understanding the full cost of the program is essential for budgeting, as some programs offer scholarships or financial aid.\nResearch and Due Diligence\nThorough research is key to choosing the right summer program. Informational sessions, open houses, or virtual tours can provide a deeper understanding of what to expect.\u00a0Reviewing program curriculums, faculty qualifications, and participant testimonials can indicate the quality and impact of the program. Speaking with past participants or program coordinators can also provide firsthand insights.\nMaking an Informed Decision\nAfter evaluating the options, the decision should be collaborative between the student and their guardians, considering the benefits and limitations of the chosen program. It\u2019s also wise to have backup options if the first choice is unavailable. Selecting the right summer program for high school students in Illinois involves balancing the student\u2019s interests and goals with practical considerations.\nThrough careful research and consideration of various options, students can find a program that enriches their summer and contributes to their personal and academic development.\u00a0This process is a valuable investment in the student\u2019s future, opening doors to new interests, friendships, and career paths.\nConclusion\nSummer programs offer a fantastic way for high school students in Illinois to explore their academic interests, develop new skills, and get a head start on their college journey.\u00a0Whether you\u2019re drawn to the sciences, arts, or humanities, there\u2019s a program out there that can enrich your learning experience and help you grow personally and academically.\nBy finding a program that aligns with your interests and goals, you can make the most of your summer break and take an important step toward your future success.\nAuthor\n\n\nWant to assess your chances of admission?

    "Summarized_Document1": "Pay-to-participate: Impact on school activities\n\nSchool extracurricular activities boost educational achievement and personal development, but participation barriers exist. The C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital National Poll on Children\u2019s Health surveyed parents of middle and high school students about participation in school activities.\n\nParents reported that over 80% of their children would participate in at least one school activity for the 2018-19 school year: 52% in sports, 43% in arts, and 51% in clubs/other activities. Nearly half (46%) were expected to participate in more than one type of activity.\n\nRequired school participation fees averaged $161 for sports, $86 for arts, and $46 for clubs/other activities. For sports, 18% of students had fees of $200 or more, compared to 12% for arts and 5% for clubs. More students had a participation fee of $0 for arts (64%) or clubs (66%) compared to sports (46%). Total costs, including equipment and travel, averaged $408 for sports, $251 for arts, and $126 for clubs.\n\nNearly 3 in 10 parents (29%) said the cost of school activities is higher than expected. Ten percent felt the benefits are not worth the cost, with lower-income parents (18% less than $50,000 vs 6% more than $100,000) more likely to feel this way. Only 7% of parents had requested a waiver or scholarship; 19% didn\u2019t know how, and 5% were uncomfortable making such a request.\n\nParents reported that 18% of their children would not participate in any school activities in 2018-19. Non-participation was higher among boys (21% vs 15%) and lower-income students (25% less than $50,000 vs 12% over $100,000). Reasons for non-participation included cost, transportation, and having a job for boys, and lack of interest for girls. Non-participation was higher for children of parents who felt the benefits are not worth the cost or that the cost is higher than expected.\n\nSchool activities offer benefits such as exploring interests, making friends, and developing skills. Participation is linked to higher educational achievement. Over 80% of students participate in activities, ranging from intramural sports to varsity sports and student council.\n\nMany activities have fees, which can be a barrier. Schools offer no-fee activities and provide scholarships or waivers, but non-participation among lower-income students remains a problem. In this poll, 18% of students are not participating, with lower-income students having twice the non-participation rate of wealthier peers.\n\nParents\u2019 attitudes about cost impact participation. Nearly 3 in 10 parents said costs are higher than expected, and 10% said benefits are not worth the cost. Children of these parents are less likely to participate. Only 7% of parents requested waivers, while nearly a quarter missed opportunities for assistance.\n\nSports are more expensive than other activities, with higher participation fees and total costs. The average sports fee increased from $139 in 2015-16 to $161 in this poll, while fees for arts and clubs did not increase. No-cost options are less common for sports.\n\nHigher sports costs may contribute to higher non-participation among boys, who participate in sports more than girls (53% vs 49%) and are more likely to participate in sports only (21% vs 10%).\n\nThis report is based on a nationally representative survey conducted by GfK Custom Research for C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital in October 2018. The survey included 2,007 parents, with responses from 961 parents about 1,323 children in middle or high school. The margin of error is \u00b11 to 6 percentage points.\n\nFindings do not represent the opinions of the University of Michigan. The University of Michigan reserves all rights over this material.",

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023.

Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nEnergy Indicators\nMarch 13, 2024\nCoal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power  will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and  the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization  over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in  Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting  for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV  purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023,  largely driven by coal use in China and India.\u00a0 \nElectrical demand\nCoal power down; wind power up \nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power  generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart  1). Among lower-carbon  power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40  TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time  frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in  2015.\n\nNatural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal  generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In  2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal  was 20 percent. \nSolar power capacity growth to outpace other sources\nAbout half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from  solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts  (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW  of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery  storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in  three states: Texas, California and Florida.\n\nNatural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation  capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25  years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be  retired nationwide in 2024.\nHowever, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like  wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of  the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less  than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was  690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity  factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity  factor for natural gas was 41 percent.\nHalf of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be  solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power  production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus  24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired  turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines  optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other  sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants  (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand.\nFor the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume  of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over  one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year  will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with  new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe  weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges  regarding grid stability.\nThermal outages less severe in recent winter blast\nDuring the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm  Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest  on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold  front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced  resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected  malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance.\n\nThe lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state  legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",

Logan Our people Transparency Speeches Connect with us Energy Indicators March 13, 2024 Coal power usage continues to decline in Texas. Solar power will be roughly half of all new electric-generation additions in both Texas and the U.S. in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Weatherization over the last couple of years has significantly improved grid stability in Texas. Global electric vehicle (EV) sales grew in 2023, with China accounting for over half of those sales. In the U.S., the West Coast dominated EV purchases last year. Finally, global CO2 emissions rose in 2023, largely driven by coal use in China and India. Electrical demand Coal power down; wind power up The Electric Reliability Council of Texas\u2019 (ERCOT) net power generation rose from 429 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2022 to 444 TWh in 2023 (Chart 1). Among lower-carbon power sources, generation from nuclear plants has been hovering around 40 TWh since 2007, while wind and solar output rose by 99 TWh during the same time frame. Utility-scale solar generation swelled to 32 TWh in 2023 from zero in 2015. Natural gas made up 47 percent of the 290 TWh of thermal generation (coal, natural gas and nuclear) in 2007; coal was 39 percent. In 2023, natural gas provided 66 percent of the 303 TWh of thermal power, and coal was 20 percent. Solar power capacity growth to outpace other sources About half of new U.S. planned grid additions will come from solar power in 2024, according to the EIA (Chart 2). A total of 55.8 gigawatts (GW) of name-plate generation capacity will be added in 2024, including 26.4 GW of solar (47 percent), 13.4 GW of wind (24 percent) and 8.2 GW of battery storage (15 percent). Solar will see more than half of its new capacity in three states: Texas, California and Florida. Natural gas\u00ad will add 7.5 GW (13 percent of new generation capacity) to the grid. This will be the lowest new natural gas capacity in 25 years. In addition, 4.7 GW of coal and natural gas capacity is expected to be retired nationwide in 2024. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewables like wind and solar and variations in demand for thermal power over the course of the day and year, total output potential from these sources will be much less than the total capacity. In 2023, installed utility-scale solar capacity was 690 TWh, while generation was only 162 TWh. The ratio of the two\u2014the capacity factor\u2014was 23 percent in 2023 and 34 percent for wind. The average capacity factor for natural gas was 41 percent. Half of Texas\u2019 new generation capacity in 2024 will be solar, matching that of the U.S.\u2019 Already a global leader in wind-power production, wind will only make up 10 percent of the state\u2019s additions versus 24 percent nationally. Texas will also see the addition of 3.5 GW of natural-gas-fired turbines, nearly half that of the nation. Most of these gas plants are peakers\u2014turbines optimized to flex up and down when demand spikes or when output from other sources like intermittent renewables or less reliable older coal and gas plants (1.7 GW of which are slated for retirement this year) is unable to meet demand. For the first time, Texas is also recruiting a material volume of battery storage capacity to join peaker plants in balancing the Texas grid. Over one-third of all U.S. utility-scale battery storage installations this year will be in Texas, adding 3 GW of dispatchable power to the state. Combined with new gas-fired units and other efforts to ensure sufficient capacity during severe weather conditions, this should help mitigate some of the state\u2019s recent challenges regarding grid stability. Thermal outages less severe in recent winter blast During the most recent winter storm in Texas, Winter Storm Heather, thermal outages were only 4.3 GW when temperatures hit their coldest on Jan. 15, compared with 7.1 GW on Dec. 23, 2022, the previous Texas cold front, Winter Storm Elliot (Chart 3). Thermal outages are forced resource outages at gas, coal and nuclear power plants for unexpected malfunctions or quick repairs and maintenance. The lower outages were due in part to changes made by the state legislature after the catastrophic Winter Storm Uri in February 2021. Measures that helped included requiring weatherization of power generation facilities, ensuring power was prioritized for critical energy infrastructure like oil and natural gas field operations and pipelines, and enhanced communication between different Texas agencies.

For decades, the industry has been an important contributor to Europe\u2019s economic growth, innovation, and prosperity, accounting for almost 7 percent of the region\u2019s GDP and being directly or indirectly responsible for employing almost 14 million people.1\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d Directorate-General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, European Commission, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d ACEA, September 1, 2022; 25 actions for a successful restart of the EU\u2019s automotive sector, CLEPA, May 2020. The industry also carries significant symbolic weight; taglines such as \u201cMade in Germany,\u201d \u201cItalian car design,\u201d \u201cEuro NCAP for Saver Cars,\u201d and \u201cBritish racing\u201d have come to stand for European innovation and craftsmanship.\nHowever, the status quo is being challenged and the industry faces massive ongoing transformations, such as the shift from internal combustion engines to electrified powertrains and a shift in focus from hardware to differentiation through software. This dynamic has allowed new entrants in Europe and abroad\u2014especially in China, the largest automotive market in the world2\u201cAutomotive industry,\u201d China - Country Commercial Guide, International Trade Administration, updated April 7, 2023.\u2014to disrupt the market and win market share. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports for the first time, with exports of about 3.0 million vehicles, in contrast to Germany\u2019s 2.6 million.3\u201cWhat if Germany stopped making cars?,\u201d Economist, July 31, 2023. These transformative forces overlap with a challenging macroeconomic environment in Europe, including rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. All of these factors have greatly affected the European auto industry and make navigating the sector\u2019s transformation challenging. A prosperous future for the European automotive industry will therefore depend on how well and quickly it responds and how European stakeholders can shape the necessary conditions for future success. The need for action is urgent.\nTo that end, we have sketched a road map that covers seven areas. Executing on this plan will require action from a variety of industry stakeholders. Speedy action from automotive companies will be important, but the regional ecosystem, including the public sector and multiple adjacent sectors, will need to participate in shaping a level playing field and a fertile environment for the future of the European automotive industry.\nA multidecade success story\nThe European automotive industry has been an engine powering prosperity and growth, employment, and innovation and has contributed to Europe\u2019s image and perception on the global stage (Exhibit 1).\nAn economic powerhouse for the region, the automotive industry contributed about 10 percent of Europe\u2019s exports in 2022.425 actions for a successful restart, May 2020; \u201cEuropean Union exports by category,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023. The sector\u2019s more than 17,300 companies form a network of OEMs and suppliers of all tiers.5\u201cImpact of electromobility on the European automotive industry,\u201d HitHorizons, February 21, 2022. Significantly, the industry directly or indirectly employs more than 6 percent of the region\u2019s workforce,6\u201cThe EU auto industry accounts for 7% of all jobs,\u201d September 1, 2022. creating positive spillover effects outside the sector.\nThe automotive industry has also been a nexus of innovation. Technical champions and small and medium-size businesses within the ecosystem have continuously innovated, especially in the areas of combustion engine powertrain, chassis, safety systems, and exterior and interior design. Indeed, about 30 percent of global automotive patents originated from European countries, the most of any region.7McKinsey analysis based on data about automotive industry global patents from IPlytics and Innography by Clarivate, accessed June 12, 2023. Significant investments into research and development have helped European automakers introduce new technologies that have contributed to major advances in sustainability and safety by improving fuel economies and reducing emissions, noise, and accidents.\nProgress and investment in the European auto industry over the past several decades have contributed to Europe\u2019s global image. German engineering is widely touted,8Dave Taylor, \u201cWho owns the idea of German engineering among German car brands?,\u201d Taylor Brand Group, April 8, 2013. and our research suggests many European automakers are considered front-runners in sustainability, with some of the most ambitious targets around electric vehicles (EVs), decarbonization, and safety.\nThanks in part to this work, the brand value of the ten largest European auto companies is conservatively estimated at a combined \u20ac200 billion; five of the ten most valuable car brands worldwide are European.9\u201cLargest automakers by market capitalization,\u201d CompaniesMarketcap.com, accessed August 15, 2023; brand value analysis based on 2023 data on European automotive companies from Brand Finance, accessed June 20, 2023; Alex Haigh, \u201c2022 Automotive industry trends: Doubling down on electric and connected cars,\u201d Brand Finance, February 22, 2022. The grand challenge now is to maintain and build on these assets in the face of profound and accelerating change.\nDisruption and transformation\nThe historic strengths and recently reported record margins of European OEMs may create a false sense of safety for the industry. Accelerated disruptions around electrification, software, and new competitive pressures loom.\nSubstantial market disruptions have been observed in other industries, with serious outcomes. For instance, European manufacturers lost more than 90 percent of their share of the smartphone market in just six years.10\u201cGlobal market share held by Nokia smartphones from 1st quarter 2007 to 2nd quarter 2013,\u201d Statista Research Department, July 25, 2013. McKinsey analysis shows that leading players in the film camera industry lost similar market share over nine years.\nMarket share data suggest that European OEMs\u2019 leadership position is being challenged as new entrants, especially from China, gain traction. Our analysis also suggests that European market conditions for local development and production are becoming less competitive. Analysis from the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility shows that since 2019, European incumbents have lost six percentage points of market share in their home market and five percentage points in China. Meanwhile, Chinese OEMs are gaining ground in both China and Europe, reaching 45 percent market share in their home market in 2022 and octupling their market share in Europe between 2020 and 2022.11McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. This dynamic is even more apparent in battery electric vehicles (BEVs): new EV-focused entrants hold 51 percent of the global BEV market (Exhibit 2).12McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023. Besides market share, European OEMs also face the challenge of running profitable BEV businesses.\nA more detailed look at different segments offers a more nuanced picture of the industry. In the premium segment\u2014home turf for many European OEMs\u2014European OEMs still hold 71 percent of global sales. But this segment is also becoming more challenging to hold: newcomers claimed 18 percent of the premium market in 2022.13McKinsey analysis based on 2002\u201322 data on global passenger-car sales from IHS Markit, accessed May 20, 2023.\nThis shake-up stems from the fast pace of change in the industry. The transition from internal-combustion-engine (ICE) to zero-emissions vehicles is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80 percent per year since 2020. McKinsey analysis suggests that many global mobility markets will reach near-total EV penetration by the mid-2030s. In response, European OEMs have announced ambitious electrification plans to launch more than 150 EV models through 2030, according to McKinsey analysis.\nThe EV transition drives the industry\u2019s emphasis away from hardware toward software and digital. According to our analysis, EV consumers are more than twice as likely to switch brands for better in-vehicle technology, such as advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features and connectivity services. Our research shows that successful automakers are developing cars defined by software, resulting in a tripling of software content per vehicle since 2015.\nWith electrified, software-defined cars becoming the norm, semiconductors and batteries are the new industry control points. In fact, more than a third of the value of a BEV is associated with the battery. Consequently, the European supplier landscape is changing rapidly, and new capabilities are needed in development and manufacturing.\nRecently, software development and hardware development are increasingly decoupling. We\u2019ve observed that European suppliers have become proficient at the interaction between software and hardware in the context of specific control units that oversee specific components of a car, such as the engine or transmission. Modern vehicles may have as many as 150 control units in a distributed software architecture. Hardware and software will increasingly decouple as software becomes more centralized into domains such as the powertrain and in-vehicle connectivity\u2014and, eventually, into computers that oversee zones of the vehicle rather than components.\nAs a result of this shift toward more centralized computing, portions of vehicles may become commoditized, and scale and incremental improvements may become the main drivers of competitiveness. As a result, several component markets increasingly resemble the smartphone industry, in which the core differentiator is software innovation\u2014in addition to economies of scale, industrial excellence, and quality in hardware. McKinsey analysis suggests that the number of build-to-print suppliers (which manufacture products and components to customers\u2019 detailed engineering instructions) in the automotive industry that provide components such as power electronics will increase. We\u2019ve found that about a third of OEMs\u2019 requests for quotes in some powertrain components and systems are already build-to-print requests.\nNew entrants are moving to supply the automotive market with critical future technologies such as batteries, semiconductors, and software. Traditional suppliers find themselves sandwiched between \u201chigh-tech commodity\u201d companies that provide semiconductors and batteries upstream and cost-pressured incumbent OEMs downstream. This dynamic threatens European supply chains. Consider that the current battery value chain is largely controlled by Chinese companies (Exhibit 3).\nTo counteract these developments and form a strong supply network like the one Europe created during the ICE era, major industry participants are announcing strategic partnerships to secure access to resources and manufacturing capacity, especially for batteries and semiconductors. For example, some incumbents plan to strengthen their control over critical portions of the value chain by partnering with mine operators or even acquiring stakes in mines.14\u201cFactbox: Automakers accelerate drive to secure battery raw materials,\u201d Reuters, April 3, 2023; Victoria Waldersee, \u201cVolkswagen to invest in mines in bid to become global battery supplier,\u201d Reuters, March 17, 2023. While these actions are steps in the right direction, the projected supply and capacity are not yet enough to meet the region\u2019s forecast demand by 2030. Accelerated efforts are necessary.\nMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\nIn a perfect storm for the European auto industry, the current macroeconomic climate is turbulent, with multiple ongoing crises. Compared with other regions, Europe is particularly exposed and affected, and the automotive sector is at a disadvantage compared with other important industries. These challenges fall into five major areas:\nEnergy and resources. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe have surged to twice the costs in the United States and triple costs in China.1McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cChina electricity prices,\u201d GlobalPetrolPrices.com, December 2022; \u201cMidwest Information Office: Average energy prices for the United States, regions, census divisions, and selected metropolitan areas,\u201d US Bureau of Labor Statistics, accessed August 17, 2023; and \u201cElectricity price statistics,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. This creates challenges for the auto industry, in which a significant portion of production costs come from energy requirements.\nGeopolitical tensions. The European auto industry generates a significant\u2014and higher compared with other regions\u2014share of its revenues through exports,2McKinsey analysis based on data from \u201cInternational trade in cars,\u201d Statistics Explained, Eurostat, data extracted April 2023. which means current geopolitical pressures have an outsize impact on European automakers.\nSupply chain challenges. Compared with other industries, the auto industry relies more heavily on timely deliveries of parts and components from international markets. The European auto industry is therefore at considerable risk when finely tuned international supply chains are disrupted.\nInflation. Inflation has hit Europe much more severely than the United States or China, with labor costs for European automakers disproportionately affected compared with other industries.3\u201cConsumer prices up 4.9 percent from April 2022 to April 2023,\u201d\u00a0TED: The Economics Daily, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, May 15, 2023.\nProductivity crisis. Europe\u2019s productivity and economic growth lag behind those of its peers, particularly in areas such as software engineering in which the auto industry needs significant additional capacity.4\u201cUnited States full year GDP growth,\u201d Trading Economics, accessed August 15, 2023; \u201cPriority reforms key for sustaining growth and achieving China\u2019s long-term goals - World Bank report,\u201d World Bank, June 14, 2023.\nFinally, these transformative forces overlap with a European macroeconomic environment that has a particularly acute impact on the region\u2019s auto industry (see sidebar \u201cMacroeconomic challenges and the European automotive industry\u201d).\nRoad map for the European automotive industry\nThe European auto industry is in the midst of the greatest change in its history. In service of helping the industry remain globally competitive we outline a road map of seven pillars for stakeholders to act on (Exhibit 4). The time to act is now: according to our analysis, European automotive OEMs and suppliers earn about three times the revenue of their Chinese counterparts and five times the EBIT, which means the European industry can act from a position of strength.\nA rapid response from OEMs and suppliers in the European auto industry will be important. But other stakeholders\u2014including adjacent industries such as the energy, research, and public sectors\u2014would also need to act collaboratively to provide an environment that enables success for the European automotive industry (and mobility ecosystem) of the future. In short, the ecosystem approach that made Europe strong in the ICE era has to be translated to serve the era of software-defined, electrified cars.\nRevive strengths in customer understanding, product design, and brand\nThe European automotive industry will need to extend its legacy of cutting-edge product design and superior brand value and transfer it into the new context of software-defined electric vehicles.\nOf the 25 global brands with the highest brand value, all but three are European.15\u201cLuxury & premium 2023 ranking,\u201d Brandirectory, Brand Finance, accessed August 15, 2023. Our data show that brand remains among the top five purchase criteria for European, American, and Chinese auto consumers. However, in the age of electrification and software-defined cars, purchase criteria will change and brand rankings might get reshuffled.\nTo maintain superior brand value, European incumbent OEMs would need to analyze and understand customer needs and preferences to build desirable products. Traditional consumer segmentation would need to be adapted for the era of software-defined electric vehicles, with more-detailed consumer profiles and more-granular user profiles. Owning and analyzing consumer data will enable OEMs to offer tailored mobility solutions and seamlessly engage consumers across the life cycle. They can also build their product development organizations to reflect customer journeys and experiences, which would bring operational roles closer to the customer. As consumers\u2019 desires change and technology advances, OEMs would need to continuously update their software remotely to bring the most up-to-date functionality to customers and meet their needs.\nFocus relentlessly on cost and speed\nMcKinsey research from 2022 shows that the vehicle purchase price is the most important buying factor for consumers across markets.16Annual MCFM Consumer Survey 2022, McKinsey Center for Future Mobility, global n = 27,869, December 2022. Particularly in EVs, Chinese OEMs can turn their cost advantage into a competitive edge: our analysis shows that their costs are 20 to 30 percent lower than those of European OEMs.\nTo catch up, European OEMs could drive down costs strategically. According to our analysis, European OEMs could close up to 20 percentage points of the cost gap by adopting structural product design, vertically integrating battery production, scaling EV production, and improving productivity. For example, battery insourcing could decrease European OEMs\u2019 costs by three percentage points, and cost-efficient battery cell chemistry alternatives could save five to six percentage points for some vehicles and segments. As for the remaining 5 to 10 percentage-point cost gap, European OEMs could identify differentiating features that consumers would be willing to pay a premium for, such as brand differentiation; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) leadership; and superior safety performance.\nSpeed is another consideration. McKinsey analysis shows that European OEMs have a long development cycle compared with competitors from other regions, with concept-to-pilot phases lasting up to four years. By contrast, we\u2019ve found that the fastest automakers in China need only 21 months to move from concept to pilot, allowing them to respond to market trends much more quickly.\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not necessarily appropriate to make direct comparisons between the Chinese and European automotive sectors or development cycles. However, European OEMs should take on the challenge and redesign their own processes to accelerate innovation, development, and industrialization. For instance, the product design process could be accelerated through iterative styling methods. Subsequent product development could be optimized by decoupling hardware and software development and by applying agile principles to software development. Across all processes, co-locating cross-domain teams and setting up task forces for products that are behind schedule or components with supply bottlenecks can further accelerate development.\nExecute a winning strategy for the Chinese market\nOur research shows China will remain the biggest automotive market in the future, which means winning in China will be important for European OEMs and suppliers that want to play a globally relevant role.\nEuropean incumbents have lost five percentage points of market share in China since 2019, a substantial decrease. Meanwhile, our analysis shows that Chinese automakers are outpacing their competitors and have gained more than ten percentage points of market share in China, driven by their hold on more than 80 percent of the EV market.17McKinsey analysis based on global passenger-car sales data from IHS Markit, 2002\u201322, accessed May 20, 2023.\nHow have they done it? Chinese OEMs offer significantly lower price points, and their products are more appealing and tailored to Chinese consumers\u2019 needs and preferences. They also bring targeted innovations to market rapidly; our research shows that more than 70 percent of new vehicles unveiled at the Shanghai auto show in April 2023 came from Chinese OEMs.\nLike their OEM counterparts, European automotive suppliers have a hard time gaining traction with Chinese EV players, especially for EV powertrain components and systems. While Western suppliers have held more than half of China\u2019s ICE powertrain market, they hold less than 5 percent of the EV powertrain market.18McKinsey analysis based on IHS Markit Production Forecast, number of model launches by powertrain for Aion, BMW, BYD, Mercedes-Benz, NIO, Tesla, Volkswagen and Xpeng, data as of 2022, accessed June 10, 2023.\nEuropean OEMs and suppliers would need a fundamental strategic overhaul to regain competitiveness in China and meet the preferences of Chinese customers. This starts with developing products specifically tailored for the Chinese market. According to our research, the average customer in China is 34 years old, compared with 58 in Europe. These consumers have significantly different purchasing criteria. For instance, Chinese consumers place higher value on cutting-edge technology, connectivity, advanced driver assistance systems, and on-board multimedia screens than European and American consumers do. Chinese car buyers also favor simplified vehicle choices with preconfigured options.19Thomas Fang, Mingyu Guan, Bill Peng, and Tony Zhou, \u201cMcKinsey China Auto Consumer Insights 2023,\u201d July 14, 2023.\nTo implement a \u201clocal for local\u201d strategy\u2014in which R&D, production, and distribution are in close proximity to where products will be bought and used\u2014European players would need to adjust their operating models for the Chinese market. For example, OEMs could localize research and development capabilities and transfer decision rights to local management. Entering local partnerships across the portfolio and supply chain will also be essential to develop a strong foothold in China and to benefit from the know-how and reputations of local partners.\nCreate resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains\nTo reduce bottlenecks and dependencies, the industry will need resilient, circular, and sustainable supply chains centered on batteries, semiconductors, and green materials. In 2021, the chip crisis led to a loss of ten million vehicles in global production,20\u201cS&P Global Mobility on short- & long-term impact from chip shortage,\u201d Auto Remarketing, July 14, 2023. highlighting a need to increase supply chain resilience.\nTo create resilient supply, localization is vital. We project that the European supply\u2013demand gap for batteries will reach almost 40 percent, or 500 gigawatt-hours (GWh), by 2030. To cover European battery demand locally, an additional 20 gigafactories, a \u20ac35 billion investment, would be needed.21McKinsey Battery Insights analysis assumes a 500-GWh supply\u2013demand gap and average capital expenditures of \u20ac70 million per gigawatt hour in Europe. This leads to a \u20ac35 million investment need, in addition to the already announced \u20ac70 million for planned and existing factories in Europe. The continent would also need 37 new semiconductor fabs to cover local demand, requiring a \u20ac190 billion investment.22Annual report 2020: The automotive industry in facts and figures, Verband der Automobilindustrie, 2020. As a first step, the European Chips Act will provide \u20ac43 billion in subsidies. Next steps could involve expanding the ecosystem along the value chain while safeguarding crucial supplies, with tactics such as increasing safety stock and implementing dual-sourcing strategies.\nAt least in the midterm, improving the circularity of supply chains will further decrease Europe\u2019s dependence on raw materials and components from other regions while increasing sustainability. It could also increase the share of local added value in critical EV components and create additional jobs and economic growth. Our analysis shows that reusing materials from scrapped batteries can also save up to 10 percent of costs and avoid 20 percent of the CO2 required in production. To implement a circular value chain, industry stakeholders would need to commit to the use of recycled content and material efficiency and establish reverse operations at end of life.\nEnd-to-end transparency on ESG criteria such as digital traceability is an important way to make critical supply chains more sustainable. As sustainability standards in key industries begin to develop\u2014consider the launch of the battery passport, which contains ESG data for batteries23\u201cAction partnerships: Battery passport,\u201d Global Battery Alliance, accessed August 15, 2023.\u2014the European auto industry should stay at the forefront of ESG performance to gain and maintain competitive advantage in the future.\nHyperscale competitive European battery and semiconductor players\nWe\u2019ve observed that European players are underrepresented in battery manufacturing and high-end compute and semiconductors that power artificial intelligence. According to our analysis, only one European manufacturer is among the top ten in terms of market capitalization for battery manufacturing, while in semiconductors, Europe needs to close the capability gap for the next wave of computing to deliver functionalities such as ADAS.\nA path to creating an ecosystem of technology champions consists of three elements. First, Europe should consider developing a pan-European regulatory rule book to scale high-growth firms, aligning tax standards, regulations, labor rules, and bureaucratic processes. Second, to stay at the forefront of technology, the region would need to build specialized knowledge and product innovation capabilities. Suppliers could tap into niche specialties, such as more-sustainable battery refining. Finally, the European industry would need a battery and semiconductor network, similar to the one that serves the aerospace industry. European incumbents could form strategic partnerships with emerging entrants and research institutions.\nDesign a way forward for ADAS with policy support\nAdvanced driver assistance systems features are increasingly important. They are becoming a key differentiator for vehicle buyers: According to our research, 51 percent of consumers worldwide would consider switching to some form of ADAS car in the future. Competitive pressures around ADAS are also intensifying. In 2022, Mercedes-Benz was the first automotive player to introduce and certify Level 3 autonomy, the threshold at which drivers can take their hands off the wheel.24Andrew J. Hawkins, \u201cMercedes-Benz is the first to bring Level 3 automated driving to the US,\u201d Verge, January 27, 2023. Other participants in the global industry are catching up using a variety of technology approaches.\nTo remain competitive, the European industry may need to form a cross-industry alliance. Players could collaborate in two main areas. The first area is where differentiation is negligible and where there are opportunities for savings. This would include standardizing sensor communication protocols, which would simplify the integration of new sensors. Standardizing middleware (which sits between front- and back-end technologies) and layers of the operating system are other approaches.\nThe second area of collaboration is where scale and large databases could enable a faster, more robust development process for efforts including the continuous updates of software layers in maps\u2014updates such as creating high-definition map- and location-based services. A shared pool of data could also be used for AI training and validation.\nThe right regulatory environment could be critical to enable this kind of cross-industry collaboration. Public-sector stakeholders could consider adapting existing guidelines to the context of autonomous driving. These updates could encourage collaborative precompetitive research and innovation that advance and accelerate technological progress and drive standardization.\nClose the software skill gap to win the automotive digital transition\nSoftware is essential to the future of the automotive industry. But according to our analysis, only 15 to 20 percent of current R&D workers at European incumbents have software skills, compared with almost 45 percent at new entrants.\nTo shrink the gap, industry stakeholders would need to find holistic solutions. For example, European incumbents could create shared\u2014or at least interoperable\u2014software platforms across OEMs in Europe (and possibly other regions where the industry has strong partnerships) to complement individual participants\u2019 capabilities and to avoid costly solo efforts.\nEarly hiring, reskilling, and foreign talent can also help close the gap. Players can intensify early hiring directly from universities and boost STEM and software talent education through partnerships with universities and schools. Our research shows that reskilling is already in progress: 37 percent of European suppliers have ongoing reskilling efforts, and another 41 percent have plans to implement them. To draw skilled software talent from other regions, European employers would need accelerate processes around work permits and accommodate foreign talent\u2019s requirements on salary, benefits, and working conditions.\nCreating an environment that enables accelerated progress\nAbout the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility\nThese insights were developed by the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility (MCFM). Since 2011, the MCFM has worked with stakeholders across the mobility ecosystem by providing independent and integrated evidence about possible future-mobility scenarios. With our unique, bottom-up modeling approach, our insights enable an end-to-end analytics journey through the future of mobility\u2014from consumer needs to modal mix across urban/rural areas, sales, value pools, and life cycle sustainability. Contact us if you are interested in getting full access to our market insights via the McKinsey Mobility Insights Portal.\nEuropean automotive players are moving in the right direction but should consider scaling and accelerating their efforts. To accomplish this, a wide variety of stakeholders in the region would need to create an environment that breeds progress and future wins for the region\u2019s automotive industry. The formula requires a road map, catalysts, and platforms for cooperation.\nA clear road map such as the one we outline is needed to help accelerate the European automotive industry\u2019s progress. Its seven pillars would need to be converted into actionable measures and quantifiable targets for industry stakeholders\u2014suppliers, OEMs, players from adjacent industries, and regulatory bodies. Associations could take on a coordinating role.\nCatalysts play a significant role in implementing the road map. One is a competitive regulatory environment. Clearly defining and communicating common standards and codifying interoperability across all elements of the road map is likely to be critical.\nAnother critical catalyst of the European industry\u2019s transition is EV infrastructure. According to our analysis, the industry will need a cumulative \u20ac300 billion worth of infrastructure investments in electricity generation, the electricity grid, EV chargers, and hydrogen refueling systems through 2030.25European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. European stakeholders have begun to install public chargers at a pace of 2,000 charging points per week.26European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. But to meet demand, decision makers would need to build out charging infrastructure to the tune of 6,000 to 14,000 charging points per week.27European EV charging infrastructure masterplan, ACEA, March 2022. We found that the wind and solar assets required to fulfill the corresponding demand for energy with renewable sources would require four times as many workers in Europe by 2030 than are currently available.\nFinally, the industry would need platforms for collaboration. As industry boundaries are redefined, three kinds of partnership will become more important: horizontal partnerships between entities in the same parts of the value chain (such as multiple car companies) for efforts such as software development or to gain a solid footing in the Chinese market; vertical partnerships between entities in different parts of the value chain (such as car companies with tech companies) to secure access to technology and talent; and cross-industry partnerships, such as collaborations between automotive players and utilities to facilitate structural goals such as seamless sector coupling.\nOur road map shows a way forward for a globally competitive European auto industry. The work will require action from an expansive array of regional stakeholders and a supportive administrative environment. Time is of the essence.\nAndreas Cornet and Andreas Tschiesner are senior partners in McKinsey\u2019s Munich office, where Patrick Schaufuss is a partner; Ruth Heuss is a senior partner in the Berlin office.\nThe authors wish to thank Ondrej Burkacky, Julian Conzade, Johannes Deichmann, Lauritz Fischer, Maximilian Geirhos, Marco Groth, Volker Gr\u00fcntges, Antonia Gutzler, Martin Hattrup-Silberberg, Martin Kellner, Martin Linder, Nicoline L\u00fchrs, Lukas Michor, Jan Paulitschek, and Kirsten Weerda for their contributions to this report.",
    "Document2": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\nA rendering of the view future travelers will see when they approach the new terminal. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nFlying is essential for work, vacation or visiting loved ones. The industry also is necessary to ship goods overseas quickly. However, it\u2019s not known for being environmentally friendly. One airport is seeking to change that.\nAviation contributes 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing (which measures energy imbalance), 2.5 percent of carbon emissions and 1.9 percent of all greenhouse gas output. So there\u2019s a strong push to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, starting at the airport.\nPittsburgh\u2019s Terminal Modernization\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s Terminal Modernization Program is a $1.4 billion project to create a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated former hub facilities, better serves passengers, fuels the region\u2019s future development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh. The new multi-modal complex will feature a new garage that nearly triples the amount of covered parking.\nThe PIT Terminal Modernization Program (TMP) was built upon these five principles that represent fundamental purposes driving the transformation:\n1.\u00a0\u00a0Stabilize\u00a0airline costs\n2.\u00a0 Be\u00a0Pittsburgh\u2019s airport\n3.\u00a0 Be environmentally\u00a0sustainable\n4.\u00a0\u00a0Enhance the experience\u00a0for all customers\n5.\u00a0 Provide\u00a0value\u00a0to our\u00a0community\n\u00a0\nCranes install steel beams as part of the terminal modernization program.(triblive.com)\n1. Airport Modernization\nThe new terminal will be between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. The new facility will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh (origin and destination traffic) as opposed to the existing facility which was largely built as a hub facility focused on connecting traffic.\n2. Improved Experience\nThe layout should make navigating the airport quicker and easier. It will slash passengers\u2019 time from curbside to airside in half. Aesthetic improvements will enhance everyone\u2019s experience, and new outdoor terraces (pre- and post-security) will make it easier for travelers to relax before boarding their flight.\n3. Increased Area Value\nAirports raise the value of the area around them by encouraging economic growth and adding convenience for potential new residents. The terminal modernization brings more than 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, and that number will increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023.\n4. Stabilized Airline Costs\nAirport efficiency can impact the costs of airlines. The expansion will allow airlines to better process and load luggage as well as welcome passengers. It also lowers long-term O&M costs.\n5. More Sustainable Terminal\nConstruction practices for the new terminal comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Environmental Program Declaration (EPD) credit for their materials while also working to reduce emissions, water, energy and waste. Officials are targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification for the facility.\nVendors are strongly encouraged to present products and services that comply with verified third-party certification criteria or reporting standards. The airport also urges them to source their products or materials regionally to decrease the impact on the environment and human health compared to similar vendors in other locations.\nAdvantus Engineers is collaborating with other teams and implementing sustainable practices such as water and energy efficiency, using sustainable materials, managing waste, employing electric transportation methods, and promoting healthy indoor environments.\nAdditionally, the airport is recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\nThe 2030 Challenge\nPart of constructing the new terminal is moving the airport closer to achieving the 2030 Challenge, an environmental initiative to go carbon-neutral by that year.\nThe suggested plan by Architecture 2030 is to decrease 90 percent of carbon emissions by 2025 and be 100 percent carbon neutral by 2030. New buildings, renovations and additions throughout the new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards.\nA Timeline for Construction 2021\nApril:\u00a0Officials added safe driving lanes and barricades between concourses C and D.

The first elevated deck slab concrete was installed.\n2023\nAll foundation work was completed on the site of the new terminal at the end of January. There were multiple concrete pours, and more than half of the mechanically stabilized earth walls now are in place.\nEmbracing Pittsburgh\u2019s History\nPittsburgh\u2019s industrial nickname comes from the rise of the steel industry after the Civil War. Increased demand for armament and iron boosted the local economy. Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie introduced the Bessemer steelmaking process, which brought him from obscurity to fame.\nCarnegie began producing steel in 1875. Meanwhile, Henry Clay Frick, the grandson of whiskey distillers, made his riches operating beehive cooking ovens that could turn coal into coke\u2014an essential steelmaking ingredient. Frick later partnered with Carnegie to form Carnegie Steel Co. and, in 1901, they merged multiple companies into the United States Steel Corp.\nBefore they reached their final success, however, a dispute between Carnegie Steel and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers put a dark cloud over the area\u2019s steel production. It led to the Battle of Homestead, an armed conflict that killed 12 people. This event paved the way for modern labor practices and worker-protection laws.\nThrough the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh thrived as America\u2019s eighth-largest city and produced half of the country\u2019s steel. European immigration through Ellis Island led to a population increase of more than 500,000 individuals. The city\u2019s diversity still exists in its various neighborhoods.\nThings changed for Pittsburgh in the 1970s and 1980s when steel production slowed to a stop, and the city had to reinvent itself to survive. It\u2019s now known for technology, energy, medicine, education, research, arts, sports and advanced manufacturing. Its National Football League team, the Steelers, pays tribute to its past in the steel industry. This new terminal aims to do the same. The new terminal at PIT invokes the essence of Pittsburgh through its design focused on Nature, Technology and Community\u2014dubbed NaTeCo by the design team.\nThe terminal modernization progam will pay tribute to the city\u2019s history through art and construction. Steel tree columns are a featured part of the new terminal, creating a nostalgic and stylistic design. Their brownish color is meant to invoke importance of nature in Western Pennsylvania. All of the steel in the new terminal, procured throughout the United States, is being fabricated just 10 miles away from the airport in Ambridge, Pa.\n\n\n(Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nThe Airport Authority also recruited artists Patrick Marold and Adam Kuby to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry through sculptures and other design elements. Other artisans contribute to the terminal through PIT\u2019s Art in the Airport initiative.\nSustainability in the Steel City\nThroughout the years, Pittsburgh made strides to create a healthier, more-sustainable city. From 2015-2020, the Department of City Planning released a yearly \u201cState of Sustainability\u201d report that examined ongoing efforts to reduce waste and minimize the use of nonrenewable resources.\nNonprofit organization Sustainable Pittsburgh advocates and educates individuals and groups through various initiatives such as recognizing corporations that make efforts toward decarbonization.\nUniversities in the city also are embracing measures to create a greener city. The University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University and Point Park University each have their own sustainability programs to encourage research and on-campus responsibility.\nThe terminal modernization project is another major step toward creating a Pittsburgh that lives in harmony with its environment.\nTime for an Update\nAllegheny County Airport was the first airport in the region, opening in 1931, and at the time was one of the largest and most advanced terminals of its time. The Greater Pittsburgh Airport opened in 1952, becoming the region\u2019s primary commercial airport. (Allegheny County Airport continues to operate today as a robust general aviation airport with more than 60,000 operations annually.)\nThat terminal existed until 1992, when officials opened the more modern Pittsburgh International Airport, built and designed as a hub for US Airways. US Airways pulled its hub status in 2004, leaving Pittsburgh with a facility built for another time and a different purpose. The airport today offers nonstop service to more than 60 nonstop destinations on 16 airlines, including international service to London Heathrow on British Airways as well service to Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.\nBoth Pittsburgh International Airport and Allegheny County Airport are operated under the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which has experienced several changes through the years, with the new terminal project being the largest.\nOfficials announced the new terminal in 2017, but construction was put on hold in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The project resumed in 2021 and is now making consistent progress. The groundbreaking happened in October 2021, making it the first U.S. terminal built from the ground up after the pandemic.\nTravelers will get the opportunity to enjoy fresh air and greenery while they await their flights. (Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects)\nManaging Construction\nACAA selected the architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects to lead work on the project. This collaboration ensures international best practices are met without sacrificing local characteristics.\nGensler is headquartered in San Francisco but has multiple Pennsylvania offices and designed the PNC tower downtown. The firm also has airport experience with Incheon Airport. HDR is headquartered in Omaha, Neb., but has an office in Pittsburgh. It replaced the Greenfield Bridge and renovated the Honolulu Airport.\nLuis Vidal completed terminal projects for Heathrow, Madrid-Barajas and other airports.\nBlue Sky News/Pittsburgh International Airport\nTaking in Local Concerns\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project. The terminal modernization has a program advisory group and a best practice group with experts in sustainability, accessibility, passenger experience, technology, health, culture and arts. These members represent constituencies, share their expertise and ensure the authority uses best practices in the new terminal design.\nFeedback was gathered through community and stakeholder meetings, interviews, surveys and the feedback section of the program\u2019s website,\u00a0PITtransformed.com.\nAlthough there are concerns with any project, Pittsburgh\u2019s local \u201cyinzers\u201d are known for being open to sustainable initiatives and creating socioeconomic changes that positively impact the environment, preserving it for future generations. These efforts are known internationally, with the United Nations Foundation recognizing the city as an example of America\u2019s growing sustainability movement.\nManaging the TPM Budget\nWith a high cost comes the need for strict budget management, and the program management team keeps spending under control. No local tax dollars are involved, and most of the construction is funded through long-term bonds, essentially borrowing money and then paying off that debt as part of its yearly operating budget. Paying for the project comes from airport revenues, including airline fees, parking and rental fees, passenger facility charges, terminal concessions revenues, and natural gas revenue.\nNatural Construction and Energy\nLarge windows will produce abundant natural light in the new terminal, minimizing the need for external lighting sources. Outside these windows are expansive outdoor terraces featuring local flora. Using local plants reduces the need for excess water and electricity.\nPlanting local trees, flowers and bushes enables visitors to learn and appreciate native plants, especially when the airport might be the only part of Pennsylvania some travelers see. They also cut carbon emissions by eliminating the need to transport outside flora.\nThe terrace will have chairs for passengers to relax as well as open spaces for kids and pets to run around before getting on their flights.\nOne of the largest changes to the terminal is the private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. These energy sources will power the new terminal, cutting the airport\u2019s carbon footprint and creating a more-sustainable environment. The microgrid is already up and running, powering the existing facility since June 2021. This is significant for the 2030 goal, as construction and demolition projects generate approximately 569 million tons of waste annually.\nThis is advantageous for passengers and airlines, providing a power source when electricity goes out as well as decreasing flight delays. In addition to being more resilient, the microgrid saves PIT more than $1 million annually in utility costs and saves more than 6 million pounds of carbon emissions annually.\nLeading the Way for Sustainability\nPittsburgh International Airport\u2019s terminal modernization project is the first post-pandemic terminal built from the ground up and holds great promise. Sustainability has always been top of mind, but the ability to continue working toward the 2030 goal after a significant delay shows a commitment to creating a more eco-friendly airport. During the construction delay, PIT designers took that time to incorporate additional public health measures into the project.\nOfficials hope projects can look toward PIT as an example that sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction and local pride can exist in the same place.\u00a0\nAbout Rose Morrison\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies; email: [email\u00a0protected].\nSubscribe\nSubscribe now to receive our FREE print publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nProject of the Week\n\nFort McHenry Tunnel\nClick here for details and to submit your project!\nCurrent Issue\n\n4th Annual Sustainable Engineering Issue 2024\nPopular Tags\nTwitter Feed\nLocation\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\n\n\u0394\nRequest More Information From Sponsor\n\n\u0394\n",
    "Summarized_Document1": "The European automotive industry is a significant contributor to the region's economy, accounting for nearly 7% of GDP and employing around 14 million people. However, it faces challenges such as the shift to electrified powertrains, software differentiation, and competition from new entrants, particularly from China. In 2022, China surpassed Germany in light-vehicle exports, with 3.0 million vehicles compared to Germany's 2.6 million. Rising energy costs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions further complicate the industry's landscape.The industry has historically been a hub of innovation, with 30% of global automotive patents originating from Europe. Investments in R&D have led to advancements in sustainability and safety. The brand value of the top ten European auto companies is estimated at \u20ac200 billion, with five of the ten most valuable car brands being European.Despite these strengths, the industry is undergoing significant disruptions. European OEMs have lost market share to Chinese competitors, particularly in battery electric vehicles (BEVs). The transition to EVs is accelerating, with global EV sales growing 80% annually since 2020. European OEMs have announced plans to launch over 150 EV models by 2030.The shift to software-defined vehicles is also crucial, with semiconductors and batteries becoming key components. European suppliers need to adapt to this change, as modern vehicles may have up to 150 control units. The industry must also address supply chain challenges, particularly in batteries and semiconductors, to remain competitive.Macroeconomic challenges such as high energy costs, geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and a productivity crisis further impact the industry. Wholesale electricity costs in Europe are twice those in the U.S. and triple those in China, affecting production costs.To navigate these challenges, a road map with seven pillars is proposed: understanding customer needs, focusing on cost and speed, executing a winning strategy for the Chinese market, creating resilient supply chains, developing competitive battery and semiconductor players, advancing ADAS with policy support, and closing the software skill gap.European OEMs need to localize R&D and production in China, develop products tailored to Chinese consumers, and form strategic partnerships. Resilient supply chains require localization, circularity, and sustainability. The industry needs significant investments in battery and semiconductor manufacturing to meet future demand.Collaboration across the industry and with adjacent sectors is essential. A competitive regulatory environment and substantial investments in EV infrastructure are critical. The industry must also focus on software skills, with only 15-20% of current R&D workers having software expertise compared to 45% at new entrants.In summary, the European automotive industry must act swiftly and collaboratively to maintain its global competitiveness in the face of profound changes and challenges.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Sustainability and the Steel City: Modernization at Pittsburgh International Airport\n\nFlying is essential for work, vacation, or visiting loved ones, but the aviation industry is not known for being environmentally friendly. Pittsburgh International Airport is seeking to change that with its Terminal Modernization Program (TMP), a $1.4 billion project aimed at creating a new consolidated terminal that modernizes outdated facilities, better serves passengers, fuels regional development, stabilizes long-term costs for airlines, and evokes the essence of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe TMP is built on five principles: stabilizing airline costs, being Pittsburgh\u2019s airport, being environmentally sustainable, enhancing the customer experience, and providing value to the community. The new terminal will be located between the C and D airside gate concourses, eliminating the need for the people mover train. It will cater to passengers flying directly to and from Pittsburgh, making navigation quicker and easier, and reducing the time from curbside to airside by half.\n\nThe modernization project is expected to bring over 14,000 direct and indirect employment opportunities to the region. Currently, about 550 construction workers are onsite daily, with that number expected to increase to 1,000 daily workers in summer 2023. The construction practices comply with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards, targeting a minimum of LEED Silver certification. The airport is also recycling and reusing construction waste, including 86,000 tons of crushed concrete for new airport roads.\n\nThe 2030 Challenge aims for the airport to be carbon-neutral by 2030, with a 90% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. The new terminal will have energy-consumption performance standards. The construction timeline includes significant milestones from 2021 to 2023, with foundation work completed by January 2023.\n\nPittsburgh\u2019s history as a steel city is honored in the new terminal\u2019s design, featuring steel tree columns and other elements that evoke the city\u2019s industrial past. The steel used in the terminal is fabricated locally in Ambridge, PA. The airport also recruited artists to create an exhibition honoring the steel industry.\n\nPittsburgh has made strides in sustainability, with various initiatives and programs from the Department of City Planning, Sustainable Pittsburgh, and local universities. The terminal modernization project is another step toward a more sustainable city.\n\nThe new terminal will feature large windows for natural light, outdoor terraces with local flora, and a private microgrid with nearly 10,000 solar panels and five natural-gas generators. This microgrid, operational since June 2021, powers the existing facility and will power the new terminal, saving over $1 million annually in utility costs and reducing carbon emissions by over 6 million pounds annually.\n\nThe project is funded through long-term bonds, airport revenues, and other sources, with no local tax dollars involved. The architecture and engineering teams of Gensler + HDR in association with luis vidal + architects are leading the project, ensuring international best practices while maintaining local characteristics.\n\nThe Allegheny County Airport Authority engaged the community and airlines to determine the best course of action for the terminal project, incorporating feedback from various stakeholders. The project aims to be an example of how sustainability, economic growth, customer satisfaction, and local pride can coexist.\n\nRose Morrison is a freelance writer with a passion for sustainable building and innovative construction technologies.",

Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.\nThis is a preview of subscription content, access via your institution\nAccess options\nAccess Nature and 54 other Nature Portfolio journals\nGet Nature+, our best-value online-access subscription\n$29.99 /\u00c2\u00a030\u00c2\u00a0days\ncancel any time\nSubscribe to this journal\nReceive 12 print issues and online access\n$209.00 per year\nonly $17.42 per issue\nBuy this article\nPrices may be subject to local taxes which are calculated during checkout\nAdditional access options:\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nThe economic commitment of climate change\nSystematic review and meta-analysis of ex-post evaluations on the effectiveness of carbon pricing\nThe refinery of the future\nData availability\nThe individual hourly cooling behaviour data can be obtained from Ecobee upon request38.

That\u2019s on the lower end among the 42 states that EnergySage surveyed, compared to an average of $34,122 and a high of $46,403 in Kentucky.\nDespite policies that can make going solar in Arizona less cost-effective for consumers, the state has the fifth-largest installed solar capacity in the nation, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Solar costs in the state have also plummeted by 43% in the last decade. [0]Solar Energy Industries Association.

Data is from the second half of 2023.\nCosts and trends in Arizona\nAccording to EnergySage, the average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW. A greater reliance on air conditioning results in higher average household electricity use in Arizona than in some parts of the country, requiring slightly larger solar systems than the national average of 11.6kW. \nHowever, the low cost per watt of Arizona solar makes systems there cost-effective. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost for solar by as much as 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost.\nThe average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, according to June 2024 data from EnergySage, with 20-year savings on an average system estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona, already the lowest in the nation per watt, have been trending down, dropping by 2% between the first and second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar & Storage Marketplace Report 2023.View all sources \n\u00bb MORE: Best solar companies\nState incentives and policy in Arizona\nAs in many states, the biggest solar incentive for Arizona homeowners is the federal solar tax credit, or residential clean energy credit, which provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of your solar power system. \nState incentives\nOn the state level, Arizona encouraged solar installations with policies like the 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, which required Arizona utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources. Of that amount, 30% was required to come from distributed sources like rooftop solar. \nOver time, many of these incentives have been phased out as rooftop solar adoption has increased in the state, and new fees have been imposed on solar customers. But Arizonans can still benefit from certain incentives and protections:\nIn addition to the federal solar tax credit, the Arizona Solar Energy Credit provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on your state income tax bill, up to a $1,000 maximum.

In 2016 the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC), which regulates many of the utilities in the state, replaced Arizona\u2019s NEM program with a net billing program known as the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP). \nThe RCP compensates solar customers at a lower rate than NEM did for excess power they send to the grid, under a tiered step-down that can go down up to 10% per year, eventually arriving at the \u201cavoided cost\u201d rate, according to Autumn T. Johnson, executive director of the Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association (AriSEIA). The avoided cost rate is much lower than the retail rate of electricity, representing the cost a utility avoids by using solar customers\u2019 excess solar instead of producing that electricity themselves or purchasing it elsewhere. \nEach utility does its own avoided cost calculation, so your RCP export rate will depend on your utility. As of September 2023, the export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively. But Salt River Project, a large utility that is not regulated by the ACC, was able to drop the export rate dramatically to 2.81 cents/kWh. \n\u201cGiven the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later, because the longer you wait, the lower the export rate is,\u201d says Johnson. \nEnergy storage in Arizona\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 in Arizona after the federal tax credit, according to EnergySage. [0]EnergySage. Solar battery cost: Why they're not always worth it.View all sources But they can be well worth the cost, especially in Arizona:\nBatteries improve the economics of home solar under net billing because instead of sending excess energy back to the grid at a lower credit, you can store the energy to use later.\nMost Arizona solar customers are required to be on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, under which electricity rates are lower at times of low demand and higher at times of high demand. You may use more electricity in your home when you return home from work, demand is high, and the sun is going down so your panels are generating less electricity. A battery can lower your costs by storing the electricity your panels generate during the day for your use in the evening.\nSome of the TOU rate plans in Arizona include demand charges, which are based on spikes in your energy demand. Your home could be using a relatively small amount of energy, but spikes during these times can increase your electricity bill dramatically. As with TOU rates, batteries can lower demand charges significantly by storing electricity that you can use during peak use times.\nWith more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Solar alone won\u2019t keep your home powered during an outage, because systems are designed to shut off if there\u2019s an outage to ensure the safety of utility workers.\nLike solar costs, battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are constantly improving. Arizona is beginning to offer residential customers demand response programs, which help avoid strain on the power grid by incentivizing customers to shift their energy use to times when demand is lower. With a home solar battery, you can get the most out of these programs. \nRead more about solar panel costs, incentives and policies in these states:\nCalifornia\nTexas\nFlorida\nColorado\nNorth Carolina\nLouisiana\nCan I get financing for a solar panel system?\nIn addition to tax incentives and rebates, there are options available. Many solar installers offer financing, but you may also be able to finance your solar investment through a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC). These options may have lower interest rates than financing with an installer, future opportunities for refinancing and possible tax benefits.\nHome equity loans and HELOCs are ways to borrow against the value of your home, converting equity into cash. With a home equity loan, you receive a lump-sum payment and then pay it back at a fixed interest rate over an agreed period of time, typically from five to 30 years. HELOCs are more akin to a credit card, something you use as needed. You\u2019ll usually have 10 years to draw from the line of credit, during which time you only have to pay interest, and after that you pay both the principal and interest. HELOC interest rates typically are variable, meaning your monthly payment could rise or fall over time. And with each of these options, you're using your home as collateral.\nFigure: NMLS#1717824\nBetter: NMLS#330511\nQuicken Loans: NMLS#3030\n85%\n90%\n90%\n640\n680\n680\nNational\nNational\nNational\n\u00bb COMPARE: Pros and cons of home equity loans and HELOCs\nAnother option is a solar loan. Many banks, credit unions and online lenders offer these to fund solar panels and installation, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000, and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. They function like a personal loan: you receive a lump sum and repay it in equal monthly installments over a set period, typically two to seven years. And unlike with home equity financing, there is no collateral required for a solar loan. This means your home or solar panels aren\u2019t at risk if you miss payments, but you may have to pay late fees.\nSo, yes, you likely can get financing. If you go this route, compare interest rates, terms and fees with any financing package that a solar provider may offer you to ensure you get the best deal.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison. Installers will start by looking at your electric bill and an online view of your house to get you an initial quote, before making a site visit to check things like the condition of your roof.\nUnder net metering, or NEM, the solar-generated electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a retail rate. Under net billing, referred to in Arizona as RCP, the electricity you send back to the grid is compensated at a lower rate \u2014 in some cases the avoided cost rate, or the value of that electricity to the grid at the time when it goes back to the grid. Your system will usually send the most electricity to the grid during the middle of the day, when demand is lower. That means that under the avoided cost rate, it will be considered lower-value and credited at a much lower rate than it would have been under NEM.\nYes. If energy storage isn\u2019t right for you at the moment, you can still go solar now and add a battery later when costs come down. Unlike solar, energy storage will not be affected by future cuts to Arizona\u2019s RCP net billing export rate.\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, you can contact local solar installers and get free quotes; it\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare, and Solar United Neighbors can help you do the comparison.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Climate change will impact the value and optimal adoption of residential rooftop solar. Rooftop solar adoption is critical for residential decarbonization and hinges on its value to households. Climate change will probably affect the value of rooftop solar through impacts on rooftop solar generation and cooling demand, but no studies have quantified this effect. In this study, we quantified household-level effects of climate change on rooftop solar value and techno-economically optimal capacity by integrating empirical demand data for over 2,000 US households across 17 cities, household-level simulation and optimization models, and downscaled weather data for historic and future climates. We found that climate change will increase the value of rooftop solar to households by up to 19% and increase techno-economically optimal household capacity by up to 25% by the end of the century under a Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. This increased value is robust across cities, households, future warming scenarios and retail tariff structures. Researchers, installers and policymakers should capture this increasing value to maximize household and system value of rooftop solar.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Solar Panels in Arizona: Costs, Trends, Incentives\n\nThe typical pre-incentives price for a home solar system in Arizona was $28,426 in the second half of 2023, according to EnergySage. This is lower than the national average of $34,122. Despite policies that can make solar less cost-effective, Arizona has the fifth-largest installed solar capacity in the U.S. Solar costs in the state have dropped by 43% over the last decade.\n\nCosts and Trends in Arizona\n\nThe average home solar power system size in Arizona at the end of 2023 was 12.4kW, larger than the national average of 11.6kW due to higher electricity use. The federal solar tax credit can reduce the upfront cost by 30%, bringing the typical cost down to $19,898. State incentives can further lower the cost. The average payback period for a solar system in Arizona is 11 years, with 20-year savings estimated at $19,628. Solar costs in Arizona dropped by 2% between the first and second half of 2023.\n\nState Incentives and Policy in Arizona\n\nThe federal solar tax credit provides a credit of up to 30% of the cost of a solar power system. Arizona's 2006 Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff required utilities to source 15% of their energy from renewable sources, with 30% from distributed sources like rooftop solar. Although many incentives have been phased out, Arizonans can still benefit from the Arizona Solar Energy Credit, which provides a credit of 25% of the cost of a solar system on state income tax, up to $1,000. Solar systems are exempt from property and sales taxes. Homeowners associations cannot prohibit solar installations but can adopt reasonable rules about placement.\n\nNet Metering\n\nArizona\u2019s net metering program has been replaced by the Resource Comparison Proxy (RCP), which compensates solar customers at a lower rate for excess power sent to the grid. The export rates for Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Power were 7.619 cents/kWh and 6.33 cents/kWh, respectively, as of September 2023. Salt River Project's rate was 2.81 cents/kWh. Given the current RCP structure, it\u2019s better to go solar sooner rather than later.\n\nEnergy Storage in Arizona\n\nHome solar batteries cost an average of $8,526 after the federal tax credit. Batteries can be cost-effective under net billing by storing excess energy for later use. Most Arizona solar customers are on a time-of-use (TOU) electricity rate, where rates are lower during low demand and higher during high demand. Batteries can lower costs by storing electricity for use during peak times. With more heat waves straining the power grid, batteries provide reliable energy backup. Battery costs are expected to keep falling, and technologies are improving.\n\nFinancing Options\n\nMany solar installers offer financing, and options like home equity loans or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) may have lower interest rates. Solar loans are also available, with amounts typically from $1,000 to $100,000 and annual percentage rates ranging from 6% to 36%. It\u2019s advisable to compare interest rates, terms, and fees with any financing package offered by a solar provider.\n\nTo get cost estimates for solar for your home, contact local solar installers and get free quotes. It\u2019s a good idea to get a few quotes to compare.",

    "Document1": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Document2": "Watch CBS News\nGet Ready For Higher Electric Bills, Regulators Sign Off On FPL Rate Increases\n\nOctober 26, 2021 / 11:37 PM EDT\n          / CBS Miami\n        \nTALLAHASSEE (CBSMiami/NSF) - State utility regulators Tuesday approved a series of base-rate increases for Florida Power & Light that will result in higher monthly bills for customers in January.\nDespite opponents' arguments that residential and small business customers will end up subsidizing costs for some larger customers, the Public Service Commission unanimously supported a four-year rate settlement, which calls for a $692 million increase in base rates in January and another increase of $560 million in 2023. Additional increases are planned in 2024 and 2025 to pay for solar projects.\nCommission Chairman Gary Clark noted receiving more than 1,100 emails from consumers about the proposal and indicated he had concerns about ratepayers subsidizing FPL's solar expansion and a electric-vehicle charging station program. But, Clark said he understands the need for clean energy investments and pointed to other benefits of the settlement, such as predictability in rates.\n\"There are things within that predictability that I think give homeowners, give businesses some assurity going into the future, that they have a stable rate climate, they can do their budgeting accordingly,\" Clark said. \"I think that is a very positive, very positive thing.\"\nCommissioners also added a requirement for annual reports on the company's expansion of infrastructure for electric vehicles.\nFPL reached the rate settlement in August with the state Office of Public Counsel, which represents consumers; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; and the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. Three other parties later signed on.\nThe rate plan incorporates the merger of FPL and Northwest Florida's Gulf Power. That merger formally took effect Jan. 1, but it came with issues such as the utilities having widely different rates.\nIn a prepared statement, FPL President and CEO Eric Silagy said the deal benefits all customers by keeping \"bills low\" while \"accelerating investments in clean energy.\"\n\"Florida is a rapidly growing state on the front lines of climate change, and our customers deserve bold, decisive, long-term actions as we continue building a more resilient and sustainable energy future all of us can depend on, including future generations,\" Silagy said in the statement.\nFor customers outside of Northwest Florida who use 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity a month, bills are expected to go from the current $101.70 to $113.85 in January. Those bills would increase to $115.52 in 2023, $116.05 in 2024, and $117.02 in 2025. In addition to base rates, the totals include costs for such things as natural gas for power plants.\nThe plan uses what is described as a \"transition rider\" to take into account the substantially different rates that FPL and Gulf have charged. The result will leave Northwest Florida customers paying more than FPL customers in other areas.\nUnder the plan, Gulf residential customers who use 1,000 kilowatt hours a month will see their bills go from the current $129.24 to $137.49 in January. They then would see the bills decrease to $134.44 in 2023, $130.25 in 2024 and $126.47 in 2025.\nFPL filed a base-rate proposal in March and then negotiated the settlement, which trimmed the original proposal by about $428 million. The settlement, in part, reduced a targeted return on equity --- a closely watched measure of profitability --- from 11.5 percent to 10.6 percent.\n\"I believe that all of the parties are to be commended for the outstanding job that you did, negotiating on behalf of the folks that you represented,\" Clark said. \"It's pretty obvious some of you did a little better job than others.\"\nBut the settlement was opposed by Floridians Against Increased Rates, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising, which have members who are residential customers of FPL.\nThose groups argued, in part, that the plan will require residential and small business customers to subsidize the rates of large commercial and industrial customers.\n\"To put it succinctly, a settlement that includes so much wasteful spending to double down on fossil fuels, that transfers so much wealth from residential customers to commercial and industrial customers, and that literally leaves residential customers worse off than in FPL's original proposal, cannot be in the public interest,\" attorneys for the League of United Latin American Citizens, the Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Florida Rising wrote in an Oct. 11 brief. \"This 'settlement' gives FPL everything they want --- and more.\"\nThe agreement addresses a series of solar-energy issues, which FPL said will support the development of 16 million solar panels at more than 50 sites across Florida. FPL has been operating under a base-rate settlement that took effect in January 2017 and will end in December.\n(\u00a92021 CBS Local Media. All rights reserved.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research. For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\n\nI have an Economics degree from UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at BNEF and continue to work as a strategy consultant at Maneas. I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\n\nHello Lindsay,\n\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Summarized_Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.

    "Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings.\nHomes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry 12 City of Chicago. 2022b. Chicago Recovery Plan. https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/chicago-recovery-plan/home.html construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction.\n\u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps.\n\u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid.\nAlong with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research. For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\n\nI have an Economics degree from UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at BNEF and continue to work as a strategy consultant at Maneas. I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\n\nHello Lindsay,\n\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Summarized_Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

As of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year.  This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day.  Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.  \nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\nHere we present the average consumption for year, month and day use. We use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures.  The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding See below for a description of the methods.  \nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10204 kWh (kilowatt hours). \nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh. \nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.  \n[Update: aggregate figures are rolling updates and new as of Dec, 2023; Statistics for state figures haven\u2019t been released and remain unchanged.]\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh.  We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. \u00a0This figure\u00a0increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. \u00a0But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.  \nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023.  This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it.  Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d.  What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much.  Canada and United States really stand out.  We included also the number of households.  You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger.  Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\nAcross the countries we chose to\u00a0compare household electricity\u00a0use varies\u00a0enormously. \u00a0The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. \u00a0The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. \u00a0Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. \u00a0In India these are 66% and 5\u00a0respectively\u00a0 and in Nigeria 50% and 5. \u00a0Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. \u00a0As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. \u00a0Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. \u00a0This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. \u00a0While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. \u00a0In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. \u00a0In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\nWhere Is Yours Like?\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. \u00a0We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\nHow do you stack up?\nData Sources\nInstructions: \nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures.  Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here.  If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below.  The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA.  There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research.\u00a0For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\nI have an Economics degree from\u00a0UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at\u00a0BNEF\u00a0and continue to work as a strategy consultant at\u00a0Maneas. \u00a0I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\nHello Lindsay,\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

    "Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit.\nThis novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level.\nAlthough this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates.\nPhoto from iStock 157317957 Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock.\n2 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d1 in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014 communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities.\nHousing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%.2 1 DOE\u2019s working definition of disadvantaged is based on cumulative burden and includes data for 36 burden indicators collected at the census tract level. These burden indicators can be grouped across four categories: energy burden, environmental and climate hazards, fossil dependence, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. https://www.energy.gov/diversity/justice40-initiative 2 According to Elevate analysis of 2014 data from Cook County property assessor.\n3 According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/il/fmr98/sect8.html 4 https://resilient.chicago.gov/ Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]3), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety.\nWe selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1.\nCommunity Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago,4 the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs.\n3 Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Table 1.

The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2.\nHigh-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3.\nA co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat Table 2.

The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history.8,9 Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan10 identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency.\nPaired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as 8 Cusick, Daniel. 2020. \u201cChicago Learned Climate Lessons from Its Deadly 1995 Heat Wave.\u201d Scientific American. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chicago-learned-climate-lessons-from-its-deadly-1995-heat-wave1/ 9 Thomas, Mike. 2015. \u201cChicago\u2019s Deadly 1995 Heat Wave: An Oral History.\u201d Chicago Magazine. https://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/July-2015/1995-Chicago-heat-wave/ 10 City of Chicago. 2022a.

This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago.

CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool.11 These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago.\nIn addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study.\n11 https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/cambium.html How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Shrink That Footprint\n\nAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\n\nBy: Lindsay Wilson\n\nIntroduction \u2013 Electricity Used By A Home\n[Update 03/09/2024: we updated the average household electricity consumption figures using the latest data from EIA from 2023 which is current as of March 2024]\n\nAs of March 2024, in the United States, the average household uses 850 kWh of electricity per month, or 10,204 kWh of electricity per year. This means the average household uses 28 kWh of electricity every day. Below we present how we computed this and electricity use in other countries.\n\nAverage Electricity Consumption Per Year, Month and Day\n\nWe use the US government\u2019s EIA aggregate electricity reports for Mar 2024 to calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures. The EIA releases data every three months, annualized over the preceding period.\n\nAverage household electricity consumption per year is 10,204 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per month is 850 kWh.\nAverage electricity consumption per day is 28 kWh.\n\nThese numbers are for a U.S. residential utility customer, which basically means a household or apartment unit.\n\nSingle Household \u2013 Instantaneous Usage\n\nThe power needs of a house at any instant then is on average 1.2 \u2013 2.3 kilowatts.\n\nSummary Table For Average Household Electricity Use Per Day, Month And Year\n\nHere is the average household electricity summarized into a table.\n\nNotes On Calculations And Data Sources\n\nTo calculate the annual, monthly and daily figures, we used the aggregate electricity use by residential customers reported by the EIA on a rolling basis until Dec 2024 which was 1,454,667,000,000 kWh. We also used the total number of US residential units, which according to estimates using the latest census figures are 143,786,655.\n\nTo get the instantaneous usage, we note that the number of hours in a year is 365 times 24 = 8760 hours. Then on average, at any one time, your house is using 10,204 kWh divided by 8760 hours, which is 1.16 kilowatts. If most of the load is during the day, then we can approximate it to be double at 2.32 kilowatts.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use By State, and Cost Per kWh\n\nFor each state, below are the average daily kWh, average monthly kWh and average annual kWh. We also provide the cost of electricity per kWh.\n\nObservations Of Average Household Electricity Use By State\n\nVariation in Usage: There\u2019s a significant variation in the annual electricity usage per household across different states. States like West Virginia and Alabama have high annual usage (around 17,593 kWh and 14,497 kWh respectively), while California has a notably lower annual usage (approximately 5,812 kWh). This variation is due to differences in climate, average household size, energy efficiency measures, and types of heating and cooling systems used.\n\nElectricity Cost and Monthly Bill: The cost per kWh also varies widely among states, which affects the average monthly electricity bill. Despite having lower electricity usage, California\u2019s higher cost per kWh results in an average monthly bill (approximately $126.03) that is comparable to states with higher usage but lower costs. Conversely, states like Alaska, despite lower usage rates, have higher average monthly bills due to the high cost per kWh.\n\nRegional Differences: The data also shows regional differences, with states in colder climates or with less access to alternative energy sources tending to have higher usage and/or costs. Similarly, regions with a focus on green energy and energy efficiency measures may have lower usage rates.\n\nAverage Household Electricity Use Around The World \u2013 2023\n\nAbout 90% of people in the world have access to electricity. This figure increased from 2010-2020 but then dropped since the COVID pandemic. But despite the fact more people are getting access to electricity we use very different amounts of it.\n\nUsing data from the World Energy Council we can compare how much electricity the average electrified household uses in different countries.\n\nWe also present data from IEA.org updated for 2023. This is in tabular form instead of a chart so you can copy and paste it. Note we\u2019ve ordered it as the chart so its ranked in \u201ckWh per household\u201d. What should stand out is that the numbers haven\u2019t moved too much. Canada and United States really stand out. We included also the number of households. You can see that Sweden is a much smaller country but uses more electricity than Australia or France which are larger. Notably Sweden\u2019s electricity is very low in carbon because of hydro and nuclear.\n\nAcross the countries we chose to compare household electricity use varies enormously. The average American or Canadian household in 2010 used about twenty times more than the typical Nigerian household, and two to three times more than a typical European home.\n\nComparing The US, France, UK and China\n\nIn the US typical household power consumption is about 10,178 kWh each year, in France it is 6,400 kWh, in the UK it is 4,600 kWh and in China around 1,300 kWh. The global average electricity consumption for households with electricity was roughly 3,500 kWh in 2010.\n\nThere are numerous things that drive these differences, including wealth, physical house size, appliance standards, electricity prices and access to alternative cooking, heating and cooling fuels.\n\nFactors That Explain Why Consumption In China Is Low And India Is Even Lower\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing in this chart is that the global average is as high as 3,500 kWh/year, given that the figures for India and China are so low. Two things explain this, household size and electrification rates.\n\nIn China about 99% of people have electricity and average household size is around 3. In India these are 66% and 5 respectively and in Nigeria 50% and 5. Average household size in most wealthy countries is closer to 2.5 people. As a result the distribution of electrified households is more skewed towards wealthy countries than population in general.\n\nGlobal Home Electricity Use Per Person\n\nBy taking residential electricity use and dividing it by population we can look at how much electricity the average person uses at home in each country. Unlike in our previous graph this chart takes in to account all the people in each country, so for places where electricity access is not universal the figures are lower.\n\nAlthough the graphs look very similar there are some striking differences.\n\nAmericans Use 5X More Power Than Global Average\n\nEach American uses about 4,500 kWh per year in their home. This is about six times that of the global average per capita, or more than five times the average for those who have electricity access.\n\nThe variation between developed countries is also quite stark. While the US and Canada are up around 4,500 kWh per person the UK and Germany are below 2,000 kWh. In Brazil, Mexico and China per person use is just 500 kWh, but growth is very different. In Brazil residential use per person has been stable over the last 20 years, whereas in Mexico it is up 50% and in China it has increased 600%.\n\nWhere Is Yours Like?\n\nOur household electricity use has been 2,000 kWh each of the last few years, which means it is about 700 kWh per person. We benefit from not using electricity for heating or cooling, although our electric oven is a big source of demand.\n\nThat makes us a Brazilian family, but global people \ud83d\ude09\n\nHow do you stack up?\n\nData Sources\n\nInstructions:\n\nFor the average household electricity use across the US we use the rolling updated 12 months electricity use published by the EIA, which means the data is very fresh, only about 3 months behind. Therefore, if its July right now, the data shows the 12 month electricity consumption up until Apr only 3 months ago. This is a change in our methodology as before we had used annual published figures. Specifically we\u2019re using Table 5_01 here. If the link has changed, then navigate to the data page and go to \u201cSales\u201d and navigate the menu as below. The last item contains two links, XLS and Interactive that lead to rolling 12 month electricity use.\n\nOld data came from the EPA data store on residential electricity provider using these files collected annually.\n\nFor the average household electricity use in each state, we use the annual electricity sales by state compiled by the EIA. There are year-to-date figures by state, annual figures and monthly figures but no rolling annual figures so these are updated less frequently.\n\nI founded Shrink That Footprint in November 2012, after a long period of research. For many years I have calculated, studied and worked with carbon footprints, and Shrink That Footprint is that interest come to life.\n\nI have an Economics degree from UCL, have previously worked as an energy efficiency analyst at BNEF and continue to work as a strategy consultant at Maneas. I have consulted to numerous clients in energy and finance, as well as the World Economic Forum.\n\nWhen I\u2019m not crunching carbon footprints you\u2019ll often find me helping my two year old son tend to the tomatoes, salad and peppers growing in our upcycled greenhouse.\n\n2 thoughts on \u201cAverage Household Electricity Consumption \u2013 2024\u201d\n\nHello Lindsay,\n\nI read your information to confirm data about energy usage around the world.

Why? Electric heat pumps, used for both water and space heating, and EVs. For example, we used 9,500 kWh in 2023. Of that total, 3,236 kWh(34%) was used to charge two EVs and 2,047 kWh(22%) was used for electric HP space heating. Subtract those two and you\u2019re left with 4,217 kWh, or 44% of total use!

    "Summarized_Document2": "Achieving 50% Energy Savings in Chicago Homes: A Case Study for Advancing Equity and Climate Goals Since 2020, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Elevate have collaborated to identify pathways to deep energy retrofits in Chicago\u2019s housing stock, document equity implications and co-benefits of this transition, and validate the findings by implementing retrofits in real Chicago homes. This document summarizes our analysis process to model advanced retrofit packages that lead to greater than 50% energy savings in Chicago homes. Based on these findings, we have also developed a roadmap with the City to guide implementation, and are deploying the recommended retrofit packages in real Chicago homes to realize these energy savings. This work was developed in collaboration with two key stakeholders\u2014the City of Chicago and Commonwealth Edison (ComEd)\u2014and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) through the office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). NREL\u2019s Residential Buildings team maintains the best-in-class ResStock\u2122 energy model of the U.S. residential building stock. For this work, we calibrated ResStock to Chicago\u2019s unique local housing stock to accurately simulate energy use in Chicago homes both for current conditions and with various retrofit scenarios. We simulated a wide range of potential building retrofits covering all aspects of residential energy use and then grouped these into packages based on energy and utility bill savings. ResStock can model diverse building types and housing characteristics, so we\u2019re able to observe the range of outcomes that might occur when these upgrades are deployed across the entire housing stock. We can then estimate potential energy savings from an advanced retrofit program on Chicago\u2019s housing stock by comparing the modeled energy use before versus after a retrofit. This novel version of ResStock, calibrated to Chicago with data from Elevate, can help City officials, ComEd, and other partners plan for community-scale decarbonization via residential retrofits. Specifically, this work contributes the following project goals: \u2022 Develop a building retrofit prioritization strategy for Chicago single-family and 2- to 4-unit buildings \u2022 Identify neighborhoods and home types that have the highest potential for savings from electrification \u2022 Assess the impact of advanced building retrofits on energy use, utility bills, and CO2 emissions at the city and building level. Although this study is specific to Chicago, its methods and learnings are applicable across the United States. These findings are especially notable for heat pumps and electrification retrofits in cold climates. Chicago-based environmental nonprofit Elevate and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are collaborating to identify pathways to achieve a 50% or more reduction in energy use in Chicago\u2019s housing stock. The partnership between Elevate and NREL enabled Elevate to share detailed knowledge and data on the Chicago and Cook County residential building stock with NREL to calibrate ResStock specifically for the Chicago area. With this custom version of ResStock, energy savings from advanced retrofits can be accurately estimated for the City of Chicago. During the calibration process, an emphasis was placed on the most common housing types in the city. These home types are located across the city and also are common in neighborhoods that may be defined as \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d in the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s Justice40 initiative\u2014communities that have high energy burdens, environmental and health hazards, and socio-economic vulnerabilities. Housing Characteristics in the City of Chicago Homes in Chicago are generally older, leakier, less energy efficient, and more likely to be constructed out of brick compared to the national and regional housing stock. Approximately 66% of residential buildings in the City of Chicago are single-family, and 28% of buildings have 2 to 4 units. The remaining 4% are larger multifamily buildings. Most older single-family homes are heated with natural gas, and only 30% of them have central cooling systems (contrasted with 76% of single-family homes nationally). Chicago\u2019s 2- to 4-unit multifamily buildings are even less likely to have a central cooling system, with a prevalence of only 9%. Through analysis of the Cook County property tax assessor data, Elevate has identified key housing types to focus on for retrofits, which have the following attributes: \u2022 Common in Chicago\u2019s low-income neighborhoods (i.e., 80% of the area\u2019s median income [AMI]), environmental justice communities, and/or communities that have historically experienced disinvestment \u2022 High potential for realizing more than 50% energy savings \u2022 Common in communities facing public health challenges capable of being addressed with housing improvements and increased building safety. We selected five top housing types that represent over 75% of Chicago\u2019s residential building stock and 50% of Cook County\u2019s stock. The types are described in Table 1. Community Prioritization for Advanced Retrofits In addition to housing type, Elevate identified 20 communities prioritized by the City of Chicago for equitable investment. The intersectionality of public health, environmental justice, and wealth-building considerations prioritizes specific communities that have the most to benefit from an advanced retrofit program. In collaboration with the City of Chicago and using the context of existing priorities and programs like Resilient Chicago, the INVEST South/West Advanced retrofits on Chicago\u2019s older single-family and 2- to 4-unit multifamily building stock achieves the following benefits: \u2022 >50% energy savings with technologies currently available in the market, including heat pumps \u2022 Increased at-home cooling access, especially of central systems, usually while reducing utility bills for residents \u2022 Reduced utility bill costs on average as electric heating replaces natural gas heating; when paired with energy efficiency, this reduces electricity usage and bill costs. Estimation of Energy Savings Potential From Retrofit Programs Using NREL\u2019s ResStock Analysis Tool Of the dozen or so retrofit packages explored by Elevate and NREL, we selected three candidate packages designed to be cost-effective, code compliant, and having a high potential to reduce energy consumption. The packages vary in how much electrification is included, meaning how much of the appliances and building systems are converted from gas to electric fuel. Package 1 included energy efficiency upgrades but no electrification. Package 2 uses the same efficiency upgrades with the addition of high-efficiency heat pumps as electric heaters. Package 3 includes the same efficiency upgrades and high-efficiency heat pumps, adding in electrification of water heaters, clothes dryers, and stovetops so that no gas-fueled appliances remain in the building. These upgrade packages are further detailed in Table 2. High-Efficiency Heat Pumps Are Major Drivers of >50% Energy Savings in Chicago We estimated energy and utility bill savings for each package by comparing the baseline simulated energy consumption in ResStock with the energy consumption of the package. In the model, high-efficiency heat pumps (Package 2 and 3) are necessary to achieve >50% energy savings in the five selected Chicago housing types. The middle 50% (i.e., the interquartile range) for annual utility bill savings and annual energy savings for each housing type and upgrade package are shown in Table 3. A co-benefit from electrification is the swapping of furnaces and boilers for heat pumps, which provide cooling as well as heating in the same device, increasing access to central cooling for Chicago households. Although Chicago is in a cold climate region, it has suffered from several major heat waves. The 1995 Chicago heat wave led to 739 heat-related deaths, disproportionately affecting low-income and Black communities, and was one of the deadliest climate disasters in U.S. history. Chicago typically experiences multiple heat waves each summer, and these are expected to become more common and more severe as climate change continues. The City of Chicago\u2019s 2022 Climate Action Plan identifies extreme heat vulnerability as a significant concern and a priority to address for equitable climate action. Increased cooling in the communities highlighted in Figure 1 will decrease deaths and other health impacts during extended periods of extreme hot weather. Even with the additional cooling service in homes, the model still estimates annual utility bills savings in most homes because of the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency. Paired with energy efficiency upgrades, high-efficiency heat pumps save almost double the amount of energy as the same building without the heat pump upgrade. This also leads to a 20% reduction in energy cost, from $3,545 to $2,836 per building annually. This reduction is due to the heat pumps\u2019 high efficiency and the savings realized by going from two utility bills to one, particularly by eliminating the monthly fixed gas fees for natural gas in Chicago. Advanced retrofit packages with heat pumps have the potential to reduce Chicago\u2019s CO2 emissions by 2.5 million metric tons per year\u2014the equivalent of 500,000 cars taken off the road! If these two top packages (Package 2 and 3) are deployed in all 323,000 Chicago buildings from the five selected housing types, there would be significant energy savings, bill savings, and CO2 savings, as shown in Table 4. CO2 savings are based on emissions factors from NREL\u2019s Cambium Tool. These long-term CO\u2082 emissions factors were selected to reflect a cleaner electric grid as more electricity is produced from renewable and other clean sources, which would represent what the grid will look like once these advanced retrofit packages are fully implemented in Chicago. In addition to CO2 savings, other air emission reductions result from these advanced upgrade packages. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s AVERT tool\u2014which models pollutant emissions based on the current makeup of the electric grid (unlike the NREL Cambium tool)\u2014harmful emissions of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particular matter (PM2.5) produced as a by-product of burning fossil fuels for electricity generation are reduced by all three packages. City-wide, Package 2 reduces NOx emissions by 2.3 million pounds per year and PM2.5 emissions by 180,000 pounds per year. These city-wide potential outcomes can be applied to the 20 low-income communities in Figure 1. In most cases, the energy and utility bill savings will be more impactful in these communities due to relatively higher numbers of the pre-1942 housing types identified by this study. How This Analysis Is Applicable Across the United States: Recommendations and Implementation This analysis demonstrates that under the right circumstances, advanced retrofits with energy efficiency upgrades and electrification with heat pumps can reduce utility costs and produce >50% energy savings in older vintage homes in Chicago, reduce CO2 emissions, add necessary cooling, and remove indoor air quality hazards like NOx pollutants. Because these older vintage homes are also prevalent in communities with historic disinvestment and/or low-income populations, these retrofit packages can improve the energy, health, and financial well-being in Chicago neighborhoods where inequities have persisted for decades. Implementation of these retrofits in Chicago neighborhoods requires coordination between the City of Chicago, community leaders, and technical partners. In terms of technical potential, retrofitting 30,000 buildings per year would mean that all homes in Table 1 would be retrofitted by 2035. A neighborhood-based strategy focusing on the 20 priority community areas discussed above could achieve large numbers of retrofits quickly while advancing equity; for example, in just seven of those community areas there are over 65,000 buildings from the five housing types. At the time of release of this case study, the City of Chicago is directly investing $46 million from the Chicago Recovery Plan into energy and equity projects. Approximately half of this amount is reserved for retrofits in single-family and multifamily buildings. This investment is the first step to retrofitting all five housing types highlighted by this study. Although this analysis focused on Chicago, its findings are notable for various cities/regions in the United States with high baseline gas use, colder climates, and relatively older vintage households. As such, this analysis makes the following recommendations for retrofit programs to reduce energy consumption and utility bills across the county: \u2022 Identify housing types with the highest potential for improvement in energy savings and utility bill savings. Homes with high infiltration levels and old vintages are likely to be chosen. For example, in Chicago these home times are: pre-war single-family masonry construction, pre-war single-family frame construction, midcentury single-family masonry construction, pre-war 2- to 4-unit masonry construction, and pre-war 2- to 4-unit frame construction. \u2022 Package high-efficiency heat pumps with improvements to the building envelope (e.g., increase roof insulation, reduce drafts and air leaks) to optimize energy and bill savings and reduce risk of death from heat waves or cold snaps. \u2022 Consider modifying utility rates for all-electric homes, or a low-income rate, to help consumers further save on utility bills and decrease stress on the electric grid. Along with these recommendations, it is important to note other takeaways that are helpful to municipal governments planning to undergo similar retrofit programs. For this case study, collaboration between technical experts, community-based organizations, and City officials was integral in successfully modeling the effects of a retrofit program. Significant time and resources were invested in sharing knowledge about the local building stock with all stakeholders. This knowledge could then be translated to identify household types with greatest savings potential, help NREL model Chicago\u2019s residential buildings, and help retrofit contractors understand the opportunities in the housing construction types.

The EU unemployment rate was 6.0% in March 2024, down from 6.1% in February 2024 and stable compared with March 2023. These figures are published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union.\nEurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, of whom 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024.\nCompared with February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area.\nCompared with March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nYouth unemployment\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, of whom 2.259 million were in the euro area. In March 2024, the youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month.\nCompared with February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11\u00a0thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area.\nCompared with March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nUnemployment by sex\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared with February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\nAdditional labour market indicators\nThe estimates in this News Release are based on the globally used International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which counts as unemployed people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks.\nTo capture in full the labour market situation, the data on unemployment have been complemented by additional indicators, e.g. underemployed part-time workers, persons seeking work but not immediately available and persons available to work but not seeking, released together with LFS data for the fourth quarter of 2023.\nLFS data for the first quarter of 2024 will be released on 14 June 2024.\nTables\nSeasonally adjusted unemployment, totals\n\nRates

Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

In Q2 2024, the economy grew 4.7%, down from 5.3% in Q1 and lower than market expectations. Extreme weather, adjustments to calculations of the value of the financial industry, and sluggish domestic demand weighed on economic growth. \u2022 The momentum of consumption slowed down with a decline in income growth. The growth of retail sales fell to 2.6% in Q2 2024 from 4.7% in Q1. At its July meeting, the Politburo pointed out that consumption would be the core engine to boost domestic demand. Consumption is expected to recover moderately in H2 2024. \u2022 Manufacturing investments held up relatively well, with a growth rate of 9.3% in Q2 2024. The expansion of equipment renewals is expected to sustain robust growth in manufacturing investment. \u2022 Growth in infrastructure investment dropped slightly to 7.2% in Q2 2024 from 8.8% in Q1. Government investment slowed down due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. With issuances of local government special bonds and extra long-term special treasury bonds speeding up, however, infrastructure investment is expected to remain robust.\n\u2022 The property market is still struggling with weak sales and sluggish investment. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2 2024. To further raise housing demand and promote activity in the property market, policies to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory will be implemented in H2 2024.\n\u2022 Thanks to continuous improvement in external demand, exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with robust growth of 5.8% YoY in Q2. China\u2019s trade with emerging markets has seen fast growth, reflecting strengthened regional collaborations. Meanwhile, the optimisation of the structure of export commodities continues. Exports are expected to remain resilient through 2024. \u2022 Overall, driven by the implementation of equipment renewal policies and the recovery of external demand, China\u2019s GDP growth remained relatively stable in H1 2024. However, it is worth noting that domestic demand is still insufficient. The downturn in prices has had a direct effect on incomes, corporate profits and fiscal revenues, constraining spending. In addition, growing foreign trade tensions may weigh on China\u2019s exports. The government is expected to adopt a more accommodative macro policy stance in H2 2024 to facilitate the recovery of economic growth. 3 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

However, the growth rate in Q2 dropped to 4.7% in Q2 from 5.3% in Q1, which was lower than expectations. Beyond challenges posed by extreme weather, the slowdown reflected sluggish domestic demand.\n\u2022 The contribution of consumption to GDP fell from 73.7% in Q1 to 46.5% in Q2. Retail sales growth plummeted to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1 due to weakness in incomes. Fixed asset investment growth dropped to 3.6% in Q2, with activity in the real estate market remaining subdued and infrastructure investment constrained by shortages in fiscal funds.\n\u2022 Export growth picked up from 1.5% in Q1 to 5.8% in Q2 due to a lower base and robust external demand. 2020-23 Average 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 GDP 4.8% 6.3% 4.9% 5.2% 5.3% 4.7% Industrial production 5.0% 4.5% 4.2% 5.2% 6.1% 5.9% Retail sales 4.1% 10.7% 4.2% 8.3% 4.7% 2.6% Fixed asset investment 4.4% 3.1% 1.9% 2.7% 4.5% 3.6% Exports 9.0% -4.9% -9.9% -1.2% 1.5% 5.8% Imports 6.4% -7.0% -8.5% 0.9% 1.6% 2.5% Income per capita 4.8% 8.3% 6.1% 6.7% 6.2% 4.2% Fiscal revenue 4.6% 31.7% -0.9% -1.0% -2.3% -3.2% Fiscal expenditures 3.7% 1.0% 4.1% 9.2% 2.9% 1.1% 4 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Extreme weather and weak demand still weighed on production side Manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI Source: Wind, KPMG analysis \u2022 The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 for the past three months, since April, and fell to 49.4 in July. The divergence between production and demand recovery persisted. The production index dropped 0.5 to 50.1 while the new orders index fell to 49.3 in July, declining below the 50 point mark. A reading under 50 indicates a contraction.\n\u2022 The non-manufacturing sector also slowed down. Affected by extreme weather, construction activity slowed in July and the Construction PMI dropped 1.1 points to 51.2. With capital markets and the real estate industry still sluggish, the services PMI index dropped to 50, reaching its lowest level for the year.\n20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Manufacturing Construction and Services 5 \u00a9 2024 KPMG Huazhen LLP, a People's Republic of China partnership, KPMG Advisory (China) Limited, a limited liability company in Chinese Mainland, KPMG, a Macau (SAR) partnership, and KPMG, a Hong Kong (SAR) partnership, are member firms of the KPMG global organisation of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

Consumption slowed as residents\u2019 income growth declined Growth of retail sales by category, YoY, % \u2022 Consumption has continued a pattern of differentiated recovery since 2023, with services sales increasing 7.5% YoY in H1 2024, 4.3 percentage points higher than goods sales growth. Robust sales of non-discretionary consumer goods and higher-quality goods contributed to consumption. Retail sales of property-related goods improved to varying degrees, driven mainly by relaxed real estate policies and effective trade-in policies of consumer goods.\n\u2022 The government has identified boosting domestic demand through consumption as a key focus in H2 2024. It sees service consumption as an important lever to expand and upgrade consumption, supporting sectors including culture and tourism, elderly care, housekeeping, childcare, etc.\nSource: Wind, KPMG analysis.

But it remained below the average of 71.0% for the same period of 2014-2019, indicating room for improvement. \u2022 The slowdown in consumption growth was primarily due to slower income growth, as the per capita disposable income increased by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024.

    "Summarized_Document2": "China\u2019s GDP grew 5% year-over-year (YoY) in H1 2024, meeting the target set at the Two Sessions. However, the growth rate in Q2 2024 dropped to 4.7% from 5.3% in Q1, falling short of market expectations due to extreme weather, adjustments in financial industry valuations, and sluggish domestic demand. Retail sales growth fell to 2.6% in Q2 from 4.7% in Q1, reflecting a slowdown in income growth. Manufacturing investments grew by 9.3% in Q2, supported by equipment renewals, while infrastructure investment growth dropped to 7.2% from 8.8% in Q1 due to extreme weather and tightened fiscal spending. Real estate investment declined by 10.5% in Q2, with policies expected to stabilize home prices and reduce housing inventory in H2 2024. Exports rose by 3.6% YoY in H1 2024, with a robust 5.8% growth in Q2, driven by strong external demand and regional collaborations. Despite stable GDP growth in H1 2024, domestic demand remains insufficient, and foreign trade tensions may impact exports. The government is expected to adopt more accommodative macro policies in H2 2024 to support economic recovery. The manufacturing PMI has been below 50 since April, indicating contraction, while the non-manufacturing sector also slowed due to extreme weather. Consumption growth slowed as residents' income growth declined, with the per capita disposable income increasing by 5.4% YoY in H1 2024. Manufacturing investment growth was driven by exports and equipment renewals, despite a slight drop to 9.3% in Q2 from 9.9% in Q1. Infrastructure investment growth fell to 7.2% in Q2 from 8.8% in Q1, constrained by extreme weather and fiscal funding shortages. General fiscal revenue growth dropped to -7.2% YoY in Q2, leading to a reduction in government expenditures. Property sales showed limited improvement, with investment growth dropping to -10.5% in Q2. Liquidity pressure on property developers persisted, with funding sources growth picking up slightly to -22.6% in H1 2024. CPI rose by 0.2% YoY in June 2024, while PPI decline narrowed, indicating moderate inflation expectations. Growth of total social financing slowed, with new bank loans decreasing by RMB 3.1 trillion in H1 2024. The central bank cut key interest rates to signal accommodative policies. Exports to major trading partners grew, with ASEAN remaining the largest trading partner. The export commodity structure continued to optimize, with mechanical and electrical products leading growth. FDI into China decreased by 29.1% YoY in H1 2024, while ODI grew by 19.5%. The RMB exchange rate remained stable despite global monetary policy divergence. Hong Kong\u2019s GDP grew by 3.3% in Q2 2024, with tourism and private consumption expected to pick up in H2 2024.",

Data not available\u00a0\nSource dataset: une_rt_m\n\nNotes for users\nRevisions and timetable\nThe data in this News Release can be subject to revisions, caused by updates to the seasonally adjusted series whenever new monthly data are added; the inclusion of the most recent LFS data in the calculation process; update of seasonal adjustment models with complete annual data.\nCompared with the rates published in News Release of 3 April 2024, the February 2024 unemployment rate for the EU has been revised from 6.0% to 6.1%, while the unemployment rate for the euro area remained unchanged. Among EU Member States, the rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) upwards for Spain (by 0.3 pp) as well as for Finland and Sweden (by 0.2 pp each). The rate has been revised by more than 0.1 percentage points (pp) downwards for Greece (by 0.2 pp).\nCountry notes\nGermany, the Netherlands, Finland, Sweden as well as Iceland and Norway: the trend component is used instead of the more volatile seasonally adjusted data.\nEstonia and Portugal: 3-month moving averages of LFS data are used instead of pure monthly indicators.\nMethods and definitions\nEurostat publishes harmonised unemployment rates for individual EU Member States, the euro area and the EU. These unemployment rates are based on the definition recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The measurement is based on a harmonised data source, the European Union Labour Force Survey (LFS).\nBased on the ILO definition, Eurostat defines unemployed persons as persons aged 15 to 74 who:\nare without work;\nare available to start work within the next two weeks;\nand have actively sought employment at some time during the previous four weeks.\nThe unemployment rate is the number of people unemployed as a percentage of the labour force.\nThe labour force is the total number of people employed plus unemployed. In this news release unemployment rates are based on employment and unemployment data covering persons aged 15 to 74.\nThe youth unemployment rate is the number of people aged 15 to 24 unemployed as a percentage of the labour force of the same age. Therefore, the youth unemployment rate should not be interpreted as the share of jobless people in the overall youth population.\nWhen data for the most recent month are not available for a Member State, EU and EA aggregates are calculated using the latest data available for that Member State.\nGeographical information\nEuro area (EA20): Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland.\nEuropean Union (EU27): Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland and Sweden.\nFor more information\nEurostat website section on employment and unemployment\nEurostat database section on unemployment, including non-seasonally adjusted and trend data\nStatistics Explained articles on unemployment\nEurostat metadata on adjusted unemployment series\nEuro indicators dashboard\nRelease calendar for Euro indicators\nEuropean Statistics Code of Practice\nGet in touch\nMedia requests\n\n\n\n\nEurostat Media Support\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 33 408\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: eurostat-mediasupport@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nFurther information on data\n\n\n\n\nThibaut HENRION\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 31 686\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNevena CHOLAKOVA\n\n\n\n\n\nPhone: (+352) 4301 35 304\n\n\n\n\n\n\nE-mail: estat-monthly-unemployment@ec.europa.eu\n\n\nShare the release\n\nWas this page useful?                \nIf you do not wish to provide more detailed feedback, please just click on the \u201cSubmit\u201d button to send your response. \n\nNeed help?                    \n\nFollow us                    \n\nContact the EU                    \n\nSocial media                    \n\nLegal                    \n\nEU institutions                    \n\n                        EU institutions\n                    \n",

REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.\nSponsored Bank Accounts\nTags: United Kingdom, Europe\nCredit Cards\nPersonal Loans \nMortgages\nBanking\n\n    Comparative assessments and other editorial opinions are those of U.S. News\n    and have not been previously reviewed, approved or endorsed by any other\n    entities, such as banks, credit card issuers or travel companies.

Eurostat estimates that 13.258 million persons in the EU, including 11.087 million in the euro area, were unemployed in March 2024. Compared to February 2024, unemployment decreased by 74 thousand in the EU and by 94 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, unemployment increased by 175 thousand in the EU and decreased by 51 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, 2.858 million young persons (under 25) were unemployed in the EU, including 2.259 million in the euro area. The youth unemployment rate was 14.6% in the EU, down from 14.7% in February 2024, and 14.1% in the euro area, down from 14.4% in the previous month. Compared to February 2024, youth unemployment decreased by 11 thousand in the EU and by 30 thousand in the euro area. Compared to March 2023, youth unemployment increased by 150 thousand in the EU and by 36 thousand in the euro area.\n\nIn March 2024, the unemployment rate for women was 6.4% in the EU, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 5.7%, down from 5.8% in the previous month. In the euro area, the unemployment rate for women was 7.0%, stable compared to February 2024, and the unemployment rate for men was 6.0%, down from 6.1% in the previous month.\n\nThe estimates are based on the International Labour Organisation (ILO) standard definition of unemployment, which includes people without a job who have been actively seeking work in the last four weeks and are available to start work within the next two weeks. Additional indicators such as underemployed part-time workers and persons seeking work but not immediately available are also considered.\n\nThe document includes detailed tables showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates and the number of unemployed persons in thousands for the euro area, EU, and individual countries from March 2023 to March 2024. For example, in March 2024, Germany had an unemployment rate of 3.2% with 1,421 thousand unemployed persons, while Spain had an unemployment rate of 11.7% with 2,854 thousand unemployed persons.\n\nYouth unemployment rates and numbers are also detailed, with the euro area having a youth unemployment rate of 14.1% in March 2024, down from 14.4% in February 2024, and the EU having a rate of 14.6%, down from 14.7% in February 2024. For instance, in March 2024, Spain had a youth unemployment rate of 27.2% with 480 thousand unemployed young persons, while Germany had a rate of 5.8% with 263 thousand unemployed young persons.\n\nUnemployment rates by gender are provided, showing that in March 2024, the euro area had an unemployment rate of 6.0% for men and 7.0% for women, while the EU had rates of 5.7% for men and 6.4% for women.\n\nThe document also notes that the data can be subject to revisions and provides information on the methods and definitions used by Eurostat, including the ILO definition of unemployment and the calculation of unemployment rates. It lists the countries included in the euro area (EA20) and the European Union (EU27) and provides contact information for further inquiries.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "UK Consumer Confidence Matches Almost 3-Year High in August\n\n(Reuters) - British consumer confidence held at an almost three-year high in August, bolstered by improving sentiment around personal finances and major purchases, according to a survey on Friday that added to positive signals in the wider economy.\n\nThe GfK Consumer Confidence Index, Britain's longest-running gauge of economic morale among members of the public, was steady in August at -13, matching July's 34-month high. A Reuters poll of economists had pointed to a reading of -12.\n\nThe survey follows mostly positive data from companies since Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory last month. Business surveys put the economy on course for solid growth in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe survey's measure of enthusiasm for major purchases rose to its highest level since January 2022, while the outlook for personal finances also notched higher.\n\n\"This more positive outlook may be due to a mortgage-friendly interest rate cut at the beginning of August, and hopes of more to come,\" said Joe Staton, client strategy director at market research company GfK.\n\nThe BoE cut borrowing costs from a 16-year high of 5.25% earlier this month but Governor Andrew Bailey and other top officials have signalled they might not follow that up with rapid further reductions in rates.\n\nInvestors were assigning a less than 30% chance of a September rate cut on Thursday.\n\nA Reuters poll of economists published on Wednesday suggested the BoE will cut interest rates just once more this year, in November.\n\nThe GfK report's gauges of past and future economic sentiment cooled, however.\n\nThe survey of 2,003 people took place between Aug. 1 and Aug. 15.\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by David Milliken)\n\nCopyright 2024 Thomson Reuters.",

Logan\nOur people\nTransparency\nSpeeches\nConnect with us\nDallas Fed Energy Survey\nOil and gas activity rises modestly as production, employment little changed\nSpecial questions this quarter focus on artificial intelligence  use and benefits, the potential impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production,  lithium extraction from oil field brine, the impact of low Waha Hub natural gas  prices on oil field and services activity in the Permian Basin and expectations for  drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nActivity in the oil and gas sector  grew in the second quarter of 2024, according to oil and gas executives  responding to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey. The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years.

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

The business activity index, the  survey\u2019s broadest measure of the conditions energy firms in the Eleventh  District face, increased from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5 in the second  quarter. \nOil and gas production was little  changed in the second quarter, according to executives at exploration and  production (E&P) firms. The oil production index advanced from -4.1in the  first quarter to 1.1 in the second quarter. The near-zero reading suggests production  was essentially unchanged. Meanwhile, the natural gas production index also turned  positive, but barely so, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. \nCosts rose at a slightly faster pace  for oilfield services, but at a slower pace for E&P firms. Among oilfield  services firms, the input cost index increased from 31.2 to 42.2. Among E&P  firms, the finding and development costs index declined from 24.2 to 15.7.  Meanwhile, the lease operating expenses index declined from 33.7 to 23.6. \nThe equipment utilization index of  oilfield services firms turned positive, increasing from -4.2 in the first  quarter to 10.9 in the second. The operating margin index remained negative but  increased from -35.4 to -13.0, suggesting margins declined at a much slower  pace. The index of prices received for services was relatively unchanged at -4.4. \nThe aggregate employment index was little  changed at 2.9 in the first quarter. While this is the 14th consecutive  positive reading for the index, the low-single-digit result suggests slow net  hiring. The aggregate employee hours index was largely unchanged at 8.1.  Additionally, the aggregate wages and benefits index decreased from 32.8 to 24.0. \nThe company outlook index was  essentially unchanged at 10.0. The outlook index was 16.8 for E&P firms  compared with -2.1 for services firms, suggesting modest optimism among E&P  firms and a neutral outlook among services firms. The overall outlook uncertainty  index was unchanged at 24.1, suggesting uncertainty continued to increase on  net. \nOn average, respondents expect a West  Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price of $79 per barrel at year-end 2024;  responses ranged from $62.5 to $100 per barrel. When asked about longer-term  expectations, respondents on average expect a WTI oil price of $83 per barrel  two years from now and $88 per barrel five years from now. Survey participants  expect a Henry Hub natural gas price of $3.01 per million British thermal units  (MMBtu) at year-end. When asked about longer-term expectations, respondents on  average anticipate a Henry Hub gas price of $3.58 per MMBtu two years from now  and $4.28 per MMBtu five years from now. For reference, WTI spot prices  averaged $79.94 per barrel during the survey collection period, and Henry Hub  spot prices averaged $2.61 per MMBtu. \nNext release: September 25, 2024\nData were collected June 12\u201320, and 138  energy firms responded.\u00a0Of the respondents, 90 were exploration and  production firms and 48 were oilfield services firms. \nThe Dallas Fed conducts the Dallas Fed Energy Survey quarterly to obtain a timely assessment of energy activity among oil and gas firms located or headquartered in the Eleventh District. Firms are asked whether business activity, employment, capital expenditures and other indicators increased, decreased or remained unchanged compared with the prior quarter and with the same quarter a year ago. Survey responses are used to calculate an index for each indicator. Each index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of respondents reporting a decrease from the percentage reporting an increase. When the share of firms reporting an increase exceeds the share reporting a decrease, the index will be greater than zero, suggesting the indicator has increased over the previous quarter. If the share of firms reporting a decrease exceeds the share reporting an increase, the index will be below zero, suggesting the indicator has decreased over the previous quarter.\nPrice Forecasts\nWest Texas Intermediate Crude\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$78.66\n$62.50\n$100.00\n$79.94\nPrior quarter\n$80.11\n$70.00\n$120.00\n$82.52\nHenry Hub Natural Gas\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nCurrent quarter\n$3.01\n$1.85\n$4.80\n$2.61\nPrior quarter\n$2.59\n$1.50\n$7.00\n$1.44\nSpecial Questions\nData were collected \u00a0June  12\u201320; 136   oil and gas firms responded to the special questions survey.\nAll firms\nExecutives  were provided examples of traditional AI and generative AI before they  responded to the question. Fifty percent of executives said their firm is not  using AI and has no plans to do so in the near future. Twenty-six percent of  executives note their firm is using either traditional AI, generative AI or  both. The remaining 24 percent of executives said their firm is currently not  using AI but plans to do so in the next 12 months.\nResponses  differed depending on the firm\u2019s size and type. Roughly half of the executives  surveyed from large exploration and production (E&P) firms (with crude oil  production of 10,000 barrels per day or more as of the fourth quarter of 2023) note  they are using some form of AI, compared with 32 percent of executives from oil  and gas support services firms and 16 percent of executives from small E&P  firms (fewer than 10,000 barrels per day). Small E&P firms were also more  likely than large E&P firms and services firms to indicate they have no  plans to use AI in the near future. A breakdown of the data can be found in the  table below.\nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented with seven potential uses, along  with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"business  analysis or predictive analytics\" (64 percent of respondents) followed by  \u201cprocess automation\u201d (44 percent of respondents). Both \u201cgeology or reservoir  engineering\u201d and \u201cpredictive maintenance\u201d were selected by 41 percent of  respondents. A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size is in the table below.\u00a0Exploration and production firms were more likely to  note multiple uses for AI. \nThis question was only posed to  executives who said their firm currently uses AI or is planning to use it in  the next 12 months. Executives were presented five potential benefits of AI,  along with an option for \u201cother.\u201d The most selected response was \"increase(d)  productivity\" (62 percent of respondents) followed by \u201caccess to better or  more timely information\u201d (53 percent of respondents) and \u201creduction in costs\u201d  (47 percent of respondents). A  breakdown of the data between the type of firm and size can be found in the  table below.\u00a0Exploration and production  firms were more likely to note multiple AI benefits. \nThe  most-selected response was \"slightly lower\" (48 percent of  respondents) followed by \u201cno impact\u201d (22 percent of respondents) and \u201cslightly  higher\u201d (22 percent of respondents). All executives from E&P firms that produce 100,000 b/d or more selected \"no impact.\"\nSeventy-one percent of executives  said they are aware of oil and gas companies attempting to extract lithium from  oil field brine. \nThe  majority of executives, 73 percent, said their firm is not doing work related  to extracting lithium from oil field brine and is unlikely to do so in the  future. Seventeen percent note their firm is not doing work related to  extracting lithium from oil field brine but is somewhat likely to do so in the  next five years. Five percent said their firm is doing work related to lithium  extraction from oil field brine, and 6 percent said their firm is very likely  to do work in this space over the next 5 years. A breakdown of the data by firm  type can be found in the table below. (Percentages don\u2019t sum to 100 due to  rounding.)\nExploration and production (E&P) firms\nThe  Waha Hub is a gathering location for natural gas in the Permian Basin that connects  to major pipelines. Of the executives surveyed, 43 percent said low Waha Hub  natural gas prices won\u2019t likely affect their firm\u2019s drilling and completion  plans in the Permian for the rest of 2024. Meanwhile, 43 percent expect a  slightly negative impact, and an additional 14 percent said the low Waha Hub  prices will have a significantly negative impact on drilling and completion  plans for the rest of this year in the Permian. Small E&P firms were more likely to expect negative  impacts. A breakdown of the data is in the table below.\nIn  specific drilling locations limited by the size of the acreage lease, drilling  a horizontal lateral in a horseshoe pattern (or U-shaped pattern) provides the  opportunity to drill a longer lateral while potentially saving time and  reducing cost compared to drilling two wells with half the lateral length. \nA  majority of the executives surveyed, 89 percent, said their firm has not  experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern (or  U-shaped pattern). Seven percent note their firm has not drilled a horizontal  lateral in this pattern but plans to do so in the next two years. Five percent  of executives said their firm has experimented with drilling horizontal  laterals in a horseshoe pattern. \nOf the executives responding, 45  percent said they expect drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern  (or U-shaped pattern) to become more widely used in the next two years. The  remaining 55 percent of executives don\u2019t expect this to occur. \nOil and gas support services firms\nThe  majority of executives surveyed, 57 percent, said low Waha Hub natural gas  prices will likely have a slightly negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s  services in the Permian Basin for the rest of 2024. Thirty percent note no  impact, while 14 percent said the low Waha Hub prices will have a significantly  negative impact on demand for their firm\u2019s services in the basin for the rest  of this year. \nSpecial Questions Comments\nExploration and Production (E&P) Firms\nOil and Gas Support Services Firms\nHistorical data are available from first quarter 2016 to the most current release quarter.\nBusiness Indicators: Quarter/Quarter\nLevel of Business Activity\n12.5\n2.0\n30.7\n51.1\n18.2\nCapital Expenditures\n8.2\n5.6\n30.4\n47.4\n22.2\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20131.5\n\u20135.0\n8.2\n82.1\n9.7\nEmployment\n2.9\n3.4\n15.3\n72.3\n12.4\nEmployee Hours\n8.1\n6.9\n18.4\n71.3\n10.3\nWages and Benefits\n24.0\n32.8\n25.5\n73.0\n1.5\nCompany Outlook\n10.0\n12.0\n29.2\n51.5\n19.2\nUncertainty\n24.1\n24.1\n33.6\n56.9\n9.5\nLevel of Business Activity\n14.5\n4.2\n27.8\n58.9\n13.3\nOil Production\n1.1\n\u20134.1\n30.3\n40.4\n29.2\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201317.0\n25.0\n52.3\n22.7\nCapital Expenditures\n10.2\n0.0\n31.8\n46.6\n21.6\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n16.9\n36.5\n36.0\n44.9\n19.1\nSupplier Delivery Time\n1.1\n\u20137.5\n9.1\n83.0\n8.0\nEmployment\n2.2\n6.2\n11.1\n80.0\n8.9\nEmployee Hours\n5.6\n10.4\n13.5\n78.7\n7.9\nWages and Benefits\n24.5\n34.4\n25.6\n73.3\n1.1\nFinding and Development Costs\n15.7\n24.2\n25.8\n64.0\n10.1\nLease Operating Expenses\n23.6\n33.7\n31.5\n60.7\n7.9\nCompany Outlook\n16.8\n15.6\n32.5\n51.8\n15.7\nUncertainty\n18.9\n21.1\n30.0\n58.9\n11.1\nLevel of Business Activity\n8.5\n\u20132.0\n36.2\n36.2\n27.7\nUtilization of Equipment\n10.9\n\u20134.2\n34.8\n41.3\n23.9\nCapital Expenditures\n4.3\n16.4\n27.7\n48.9\n23.4\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20136.5\n0.0\n6.5\n80.4\n13.0\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n4.4\n4.0\n13.3\n77.8\n8.9\nEmployment\n4.3\n\u20132.1\n23.4\n57.4\n19.1\nEmployment Hours\n12.8\n0.0\n27.7\n57.4\n14.9\nWages and Benefits\n23.4\n30.0\n25.5\n72.3\n2.1\nInput Costs\n42.2\n31.2\n44.4\n53.3\n2.2\nPrices Received for Services\n\u20134.4\n\u20136.2\n13.0\n69.6\n17.4\nOperating Margin\n\u201313.0\n\u201335.4\n19.6\n47.8\n32.6\nCompany Outlook\n\u20132.1\n4.5\n23.4\n51.1\n25.5\nUncertainty\n34.0\n30.0\n40.4\n53.2\n6.4\nBusiness Indicators: Year/Year\nLevel of Business Activity\n16.7\n1.5\n45.5\n25.8\n28.8\nCapital Expenditures\n10.1\n7.7\n41.1\n27.9\n31.0\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20135.4\n\u201312.8\n14.6\n65.4\n20.0\nEmployment\n8.3\n11.1\n26.3\n55.6\n18.0\nEmployee Hours\n11.3\n6.0\n26.5\n58.3\n15.2\nWages and Benefits\n52.6\n52.2\n56.4\n39.8\n3.8\nCompany Outlook\n13.7\n10.0\n41.1\n31.5\n27.4\nLevel of Business Activity\n18.6\n7.8\n43.0\n32.6\n24.4\nOil Production\n3.5\n\u20131.1\n38.4\n26.7\n34.9\nNatural Gas Wellhead Production\n2.3\n\u201318.4\n34.9\n32.6\n32.6\nCapital Expenditures\n1.2\n2.3\n33.3\n34.5\n32.1\nExpected Level of Capital Expenditures Next Year\n10.3\n26.1\n37.9\n34.5\n27.6\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20137.0\n\u201318.4\n11.8\n69.4\n18.8\nEmployment\n5.8\n13.5\n20.7\n64.4\n14.9\nEmployee Hours\n6.9\n10.2\n17.4\n72.1\n10.5\nWages and Benefits\n51.7\n52.2\n54.0\n43.7\n2.3\nFinding and Development Costs\n11.6\n28.0\n30.2\n51.2\n18.6\nLease Operating Expenses\n38.0\n38.6\n50.6\n36.8\n12.6\nCompany Outlook\n15.0\n14.4\n40.0\n35.0\n25.0\nLevel of Business Activity\n13.0\n\u201311.1\n50.0\n13.0\n37.0\nUtilization of Equipment\n9.1\n\u201311.1\n45.5\n18.2\n36.4\nCapital Expenditures\n26.7\n18.6\n55.6\n15.6\n28.9\nSupplier Delivery Time\n\u20132.2\n\u20132.2\n20.0\n57.8\n22.2\nLag Time in Delivery of Firm's Services\n6.8\n6.7\n18.2\n70.5\n11.4\nEmployment\n13.1\n6.6\n37.0\n39.1\n23.9\nEmployment Hours\n19.6\n\u20132.2\n43.5\n32.6\n23.9\nWages and Benefits\n54.4\n52.2\n60.9\n32.6\n6.5\nInput Costs\n66.6\n71.2\n69.0\n28.6\n2.4\nPrices Received for Services\n11.4\n13.3\n34.1\n43.2\n22.7\nOperating Margin\n\u201315.9\n\u201335.6\n27.3\n29.5\n43.2\nCompany Outlook\n11.4\n2.2\n43.2\n25.0\n31.8\nActivity Chart\n\n Downloadable chart | Chart data\nComments from Survey Respondents\nThese comments are from respondents\u2019 completed surveys  and have been edited for publication.

    "Document2": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",
    "Summarized_Document1": "The Dallas Fed Energy Survey for the second quarter of 2024 indicates modest growth in the oil and gas sector. The business activity index rose from 2.0 in the first quarter to 12.5. Oil production was nearly unchanged, with the index moving from -4.1 to 1.1, while natural gas production turned slightly positive, increasing from -17.0 to 2.3. Costs for oilfield services rose faster, with the input cost index climbing from 31.2 to 42.2, whereas costs for exploration and production (E&P) firms slowed, with the finding and development costs index dropping from 24.2 to 15.7. The lease operating expenses index also declined from 33.7 to 23.6. Equipment utilization for oilfield services firms improved, with the index rising from -4.2 to 10.9, and the operating margin index, though still negative, improved from -35.4 to -13.0. Employment indicators showed little change, with the aggregate employment index at 2.9 and the aggregate employee hours index at 8.1. The company outlook index remained stable at 10.0, with E&P firms showing more optimism (16.8) compared to services firms (-2.1). The overall outlook uncertainty index stayed at 24.1. Respondents expect the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price to be $79 per barrel by year-end 2024, with a range of $62.5 to $100 per barrel. For longer-term expectations, the average anticipated WTI price is $83 per barrel in two years and $88 per barrel in five years. The expected Henry Hub natural gas price is $3.01 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) at year-end, with longer-term expectations of $3.58 per MMBtu in two years and $4.28 per MMBtu in five years. Data were collected from June 12\u201320, with 138 energy firms responding, including 90 E&P firms and 48 oilfield services firms. Special questions this quarter focused on AI usage, the impact of consolidation on U.S. oil production, lithium extraction from oil field brine, and the effect of low Waha Hub natural gas prices on Permian Basin activity. Fifty percent of executives reported no current or planned AI use, while 26 percent are using AI, and 24 percent plan to do so within 12 months. Larger E&P firms are more likely to use AI compared to smaller firms. The most common AI applications are business analysis or predictive analytics (64%), process automation (44%), geology or reservoir engineering (41%), and predictive maintenance (41%). The primary benefits of AI cited were increased productivity (62%), better information access (53%), and cost reduction (47%). Regarding lithium extraction, 71% of executives are aware of efforts to extract lithium from oil field brine, but 73% of firms are not involved and unlikely to pursue it. Low Waha Hub natural gas prices are expected to have a slightly negative impact on drilling and completion plans for 43% of E&P firms, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Most firms (89%) have not experimented with drilling horizontal laterals in a horseshoe pattern, though 45% expect this technique to become more common in the next two years. For oil and gas support services firms, 57% expect a slightly negative impact on demand due to low Waha Hub prices, with 14% anticipating a significantly negative impact. Historical data from the survey are available from the first quarter of 2016 to the most recent quarter.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.

    "Document1": "State of the Consumer 2024: What\u2019s now and what\u2019s next\nIf you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands.\nThese are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed.\nIn this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise\u00a0research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d\nNine trends defining the global consumer market\nTo forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth.\nWho is the future consumer?\nConsumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved.\n1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend.\nAmong this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies (Exhibit 1). This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies.\n2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age.1\u201cAgeing,\u201d United Nations, accessed May 29, 2024. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood.\nDespite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age.\nIn emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets2Forty-two percent of consumers in Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nsaid they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe3Throughout this article, we will refer to \u201cEurope\u201d to indicate France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\nand 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk.\n3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers.\nThis intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers.\nWhat will consumers want?\nWhat consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies.\n4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers\u00a0switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups.\nIn advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts (Exhibit 2). Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior.\nThis weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers.\nOne beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality.\n5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims\u00a0outpaced sales of products without such claims.\nWhile young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023 (Exhibit 3).\nYounger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims.\n6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually.4\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\nIn advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets.\nIn emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States (Exhibit 4).\nIt\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so.\nWeight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years.\nBy 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective.5\u201cThe trends defining the $1.8 trillion global wellness market in 2024,\u201d McKinsey, January 16, 2024.\n7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually\u00a0by 2040.6Kweilin Ellingrud, Lucy P\u00e9rez, Anouk Petersen, and Valentina Sartori, Closing the women\u2019s health gap: A $1 trillion opportunity to improve lives and economies, McKinsey Health Institute, January 17, 2024.\nA higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well.\nWhere will consumers shop?\nKnowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world.\n8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend.\nJust because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas.\nEmerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world.\n9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind (Exhibit 5). Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States.\nAttempts to grow the social-commerce market\u00a0in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today.7\u201cSocial commerce: The future of how consumers interact with brands,\u201d McKinsey, October 19, 2022. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months.\nFour imperatives to win the consumer of the future\nIn light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives:\nBuild microtargeting capabilities\nAbout QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey\nQuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe.\nRather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments\u00a0at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases.\nInvest in wellness\nA rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging).\nPropel the social\u2013digital experience\nCompanies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries)\u00a0become more important.\nWe see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers.\nOffer premium products where they matter\nOffering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures.\nIn this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.\nThe authors wish to thank Cait Pearson, Heather Gouinlock, and Keir Sullivan for their contributions to this article.\nThis article was edited by Alexandra Mondalek, an editor in the New York office.",

But we still see opportunities.\n                \n\n                        Overview\nContributors\nAlan Wynne\nGlobal Investment Strategist\nHalftime report\nMarkets got the start to 2024 that we were looking for. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are up over +15% and +18.5% (in price terms) respectively. Stocks performed well straight from the jump. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January. Since then, we\u2019ve hit 31 more.\nIt was the fifth best first half for the S&P\u2009500 in the last 25 years (only 2013, 2019, 2021 and 2023 gained more). Notably, just four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon) have contributed more than half of the gain. Strong first halves of the year tend to beget strong second halves \u2013 in the 22 other instances since 1950 that the S&P 500 has been up at least 10% or more in the first half, it\u2019s rallied further in the second half 18 of those times, with the full year up on average above +25%.1\nThe stock market has also been helped by the inflation outlook. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at a 2.6% pace (its slowest since 2021) and we expect further cooling towards the 2% target. In the second half of the year, we expect the Federal Reserve to join other central banks in the global easing cycle. Of the 37 Central Banks we track, 21 are cutting interest rates. That likely means this is as good as it gets for cash rates.\nHeading into the holiday weekend, we offer a look at the events that have dominated the headlines so far this year and how they have impacted markets and the economy.

    "Summarized_Document1": "If you think you know consumer behavior, think again. Middle-income consumers are feeling the squeeze and worrying about inflation but aren\u2019t holding back on splurges. Rather than sticking to tight budgets in retirement, aging consumers are splurging too. Speaking of older shoppers, it turns out that the brand loyalty they\u2019ve long been known for is a thing of the past. And young consumers in Asia and the Middle East are more likely than those in Western markets to switch to higher-priced brands. These are just some of the large-scale shifts taking place in the global consumer landscape. Consumers have continued to defy expectations and behave in atypical ways, keeping consumer goods manufacturers and retailers on their toes. More than ever, companies that cultivate a detailed, up-to-date understanding of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s consumers\u2014who they are, what they want, and where and how they shop\u2014will be best positioned to succeed. In this article, we draw on our ConsumerWise research to delve into nine trends shaping the global consumer sector and four imperatives to help consumer businesses move from \u201cnow\u201d to \u201cnext.\u201d Nine trends defining the global consumer market To forecast where the global consumer landscape is heading, we surveyed more than 15,000 consumers in 18 markets that together make up 90 percent of global GDP. Their answers revealed surprising nuances about demographic groups, seemingly contradictory consumer behaviors, and categories poised for growth. Who is the future consumer? Consumers no longer fit into traditional archetypes. Some of the most influential consumers of tomorrow are currently underserved. 1. Young people in emerging markets. By 2030, 75 percent of consumers in emerging markets will be between the ages of 15 and 34. Our data indicates these consumers may be optimistic about the economy and willing to spend. Among this group, young consumers aged 18 to 24 in Asian and Middle Eastern nations, such as India and Saudi Arabia, will be particularly important to consumer businesses, given their pent-up demand and willingness to spend. These consumers indicate a strong desire to spend on premium products, so much so that they are up to two times more likely to trade up\u2014meaning opt for higher-priced brands and retailers\u2014than young consumers in advanced economies. They are also up to three times more optimistic about their respective economies. This optimism could translate into higher levels of future consumption. It\u2019s worth noting that young consumers in Latin America are actually less likely to trade up than young consumers in other emerging economies. 2. Retired and ready to spend. Longer life expectancies and declining birth rates, particularly in advanced economies, are pushing the global population of people older than 65 to increase at a quicker rate than the population of people younger than that age. Yet for all the data relating to aging populations, older consumers are often misunderstood. Despite the financial constraints that may accompany retirement, aging consumers across all income levels are willing to spend on discretionary items. In experiential categories such as travel, older consumers\u2019 intent to splurge is even higher than that of millennials, who have historically been big travel spenders. High-income baby boomer and Silent Generation consumers (those whose household incomes exceed $100,000) are a sizable cohort in the United States, making up 30 percent of the market\u2014and they\u2019re more likely to spend on discretionary purchases, such as home improvement and gardening, compared with lower-income consumers their age. In emerging markets, it\u2019s not just younger consumers who are ready to spend but their parents, too. Wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets are more optimistic, expect to spend more on discretionary items, and plan on treating themselves more than wealthy aging consumers in advanced markets. In one of the starkest examples, 42 percent of wealthy aging consumers in emerging markets said they expect to spend more on entertainment, compared with 7 percent of comparable consumers in Europe and 11 percent in the United States. We see a similar willingness to spend in categories such as home improvement, airline flights, and hotel stays. Consumer businesses that market exclusively to younger consumers are thus missing out; they ignore wealthy aging consumers at their own risk. 3. The squeezed-but-splurging middle. We expect that cost-of-living increases in advanced economies will continue to put pressure on middle-income consumers. While conventional wisdom would suggest that these consumers will clamp down on discretionary spending as a result, our data reveals something different: instead, middle-income consumers in Europe and the United States say they plan to splurge on discretionary items at a rate that is comparable with that of high-income consumers. This intent to splurge appears across various categories, including experience-based categories such as travel and dining out, as well as groceries and discretionary goods. Middle-income consumers might typically be expected to delay purchases during economically challenging times, but our research shows that they\u2019re only slightly more inclined to delay purchases than wealthier consumers. They\u2019re also not much more likely to trade down than higher-income consumers. What will consumers want? What consumers want is changing too. Weakened brand loyalty, affordability over sustainability, and heightened interest in wellness products and services reflect the preferences and priorities of consumers across ages and geographies. 4. Brand exploration. When they couldn\u2019t find exactly what they needed because of pandemic-era supply chain disruptions, roughly half of consumers switched products or brands. That behavioral change has proved quite sticky: consumers continue to be open to exploring alternatives, and brand loyalty is fading across demographic groups. In advanced markets, over a third of consumers have tried different brands, and approximately 40 percent have switched retailers in search of better prices and discounts. Inflation and economic uncertainty are almost certainly inducing this behavior. This weakening of brand loyalty is not limited to a specific age group. In the past, older consumers remained consistently loyal to their preferred brands, but today, they\u2019re just as likely to embrace new brands and retailers. In Europe and the United States, Gen Zers and millennials are only slightly more likely than older consumers to trade down to lower-priced brands and retailers. One beneficiary of this rampant downtrading is private labels. Thirty-six percent of consumers plan to purchase private-label products more frequently, and 60 percent believe private brands offer equal or better quality. 5. Sustainability: Value upstages values. In recent years, young consumers in our survey data said they prioritized sustainability considerations when making purchases. It wasn\u2019t all talk: in the United States, sales of products with sustainability-related claims outpaced sales of products without such claims. While young consumers still say they care about sustainability, they are now making clear trade-offs in the face of economic uncertainty and inflation. In Europe and the United States, fewer Gen Zers and millennials ranked sustainability claims as an important purchasing factor at the beginning of 2024 than in 2023. Younger consumers aren\u2019t just deprioritizing sustainability in their purchase decisions; they\u2019ve also become less willing to pay a premium for sustainable products. In Europe and the United States, the percentage of young consumers willing to pay a premium for products with sustainability claims declined by up to four percentage points across product categories. Among these consumers, only a very small percentage were willing to pay a premium for personal care and apparel products with sustainability claims. 6. The worldwide wellness wave. We estimate the global wellness market to be worth more than $1.8 trillion, growing 5 to 10 percent annually. In advanced economies, health and wellness products and services have been in high demand over the past several years. Today, these categories are also growing quickly in emerging markets, and in some cases, growth in intent to spend on health and wellness products in emerging markets is outpacing growth in advanced markets. In emerging markets such as China, India, and the Middle East, the percentage of consumers who intend to increase their spending on wellness products and services is two to three times higher than in advanced markets such as Canada and the United States. It\u2019s not only Gen Zers and millennials who are propelling growth in this space, but also Gen Xers and baby boomers. To be sure, regional variations appear. According to our research, for example, 63 percent of baby boomers in China intend to spend more on fitness in the near future, while only 4 percent of the same cohort in India plan to do so. Weight management products and services, in particular, could help induce growth in the wellness sector over the next several years. By 2035, just over half of the world\u2019s population is projected to be overweight or obese. At the same time, the availability of weight management drugs is expected to grow as more health plans approve coverage, doctors are able to prescribe them for more uses, and doses are made available in pill form. Adoption of these drugs, compared with other weight management solutions (such as dieting or exercise), will depend on cultural norms and beliefs, too. Less than 30 percent of Chinese and UK consumers consider weight loss drugs to be very effective. 7. Wellness for women. Investments in women\u2019s wellness are also growing. Consumers in both advanced and emerging markets are indicating a greater interest in spending on women\u2019s wellness products and services, as well as on adjacent personal-care categories. We estimate that closing the women\u2019s health gap could be worth $1 trillion annually by 2040. A higher percentage of women in emerging markets (48 percent), in fact, indicate an intent to splurge on beauty and personal-care products and fitness, compared with women in advanced markets (27 percent). And young women are especially interested in wellness: Gen Z women across both emerging and advanced markets said they expect to spend more on personal-care goods and services, compared with Gen Xers and baby boomers. As innovation in women\u2019s health continues to push the sector forward, we expect spending to increase as well. Where will consumers shop? Knowing what consumers want means little if businesses do not meet consumers where they are. Global migration patterns\u2014both to and from major urban hubs\u2014are changing where consumers spend their time and money in the physical world, while growth in social commerce accounts for new movement in the digital world. 8. The new urban hot spots. In both advanced and emerging markets, people are moving to seek out new opportunities and a better quality of life. In advanced markets like the United States, consumers are moving away from larger cities in the Pacific Northwest and the Northeast to \u201csecondary cities,\u201d or those with populations between 50,000 and 500,000 people. Two-thirds of the fastest-growing US cities are in the South and West. In these cities, the cost of living is lower than in larger cities, and remote work opportunities are plentiful. Millennials, Gen Xers, and boomers are propelling this trend. Just because US consumers are moving to scaled-down versions of metropolises does not mean they are curtailing their spending: just as many consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge as do consumers in the largest American cities. Meanwhile, 1.3 times more consumers in secondary cities say they plan to splurge, compared with US consumers in rural areas. Emerging markets will continue to see urban-population growth in both megacities and secondary cities as consumers move in search of better economic opportunities and improved well-being. By 2035, for example, 43 percent of the Indian population may reside in urban areas, up from 35 percent in 2018. In China, the percentage of middle-class households is expected to increase in both tier-one and tier-two cities as well as in tier-three and tier-four cities by 2030. And by 2040, there will be 537 million people in African urban centers, making the African urban population the largest in the world. 9. Social commerce takes flight. For several years, China has led the world in the adoption of social commerce, in which consumers browse and buy directly through social media and content creation platforms. Today, social-commerce markets in both China and India continue to mature, while those in other emerging-market countries\u2014such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates\u2014are close behind. Consumers in these countries consistently spend more on purchases made through social media platforms, compared with consumers in Europe and the United States. Attempts to grow the social-commerce market in the West have had limited success. Companies simply may have been too early to embrace this opportunity. We expect social commerce in the United States to expand to $145 billion by 2027, up from $67 billion today. Gen Zers and millennials are propelling this growth: they make purchases on social media four times more often than older generations do. More than a third of Gen Z and millennial survey respondents said they had made a purchase on social media in the prior three months. Four imperatives to win the consumer of the future In light of these nine forward-looking themes, what should consumer companies do? The most successful ones will be those that act on four imperatives: Build microtargeting capabilities About QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey QuantumBlack, McKinsey\u2019s AI arm, helps companies transform using the power of technology, technical expertise, and industry experts. With thousands of practitioners at QuantumBlack (data engineers, data scientists, product managers, designers, and software engineers) and McKinsey (industry and domain experts), we are working to solve the world\u2019s most important AI challenges. QuantumBlack Labs is our center of technology development and client innovation, which has been driving cutting-edge advancements and developments in AI through locations across the globe. Rather than putting consumers in predefined\u2014and often outdated\u2014boxes, companies should focus on microtargeting to build a richer understanding of consumer preferences. This involves taking a \u201csmart reach\u201d approach, whereby consumer businesses use their consumer data to target specific microsegments of consumers who may demonstrate particular shopping behaviors or preferences. Generative AI can help consumer businesses reach these microsegments at scale by increasing creative output and automating marketing outreach. Through microtargeting, companies can engage high-potential consumer groups\u2014for example, younger people in emerging markets or wealthy aging individuals\u2014and provide personalized experiences that build brand love and loyalty and propel future purchases. Invest in wellness A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities in the $1.8 trillion global-consumer-wellness space. Consumer goods leaders have a chance to reevaluate their product development road maps and consider whether they have more opportunities to introduce personalized-wellness products to priority consumer groups. Consumers across the globe want data- and science-backed health and wellness solutions. Best-in-class companies should evaluate opportunities to lean into these offerings and other wellness growth areas (such as women\u2019s health and healthy aging). Propel the social\u2013digital experience Companies should take steps to engage with consumers on social media and other digital platforms. This involves identifying the right channels and platforms, creating attractive content, and tailoring strategies to meet evolving consumer needs. This is especially important as industry lines blur (for example, as consumer companies enter the healthcare space and vice versa) and as ecosystems (networks or partnerships that cut across different industries) become more important. We see innovative, international companies testing new approaches to social commerce to connect with consumers on a local level. Some are mobilizing local key opinion leaders to precisely target consumers and create viral digital campaigns that resonate with them. Social media and private chats through platforms such as WeChat help to continually engage consumers. Offer premium products where they matter Offering premium products in relevant categories can help improve brand loyalty. Consumer brands should identify which categories are ripe for this, such as experiential travel\u2014where splurge activity is common even across middle-income and aging consumers. Conversely, some categories are more suitable for value plays based on trade-down behavior or frequent brand exploration. Integrating loyalty and pricing strategies, instituting pricing tiers, and tailoring product assortments at the local and channel levels are ways that consumer businesses can provide value to consumers, while also managing economic pressures. In this consumer landscape\u2014one in which standards, complexity, and stakes are all higher\u2014leaders should understand the new nuances that define who the \u201cnext\u201d shoppers are, what they care about, and how they shop. These insights, which should then inform strategic category and channel investments, can lead to long-term, profitable growth and sustained competitive advantage.

    "Summarized_Document2": "The markets have had a strong start to 2024, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 up over 15% and 18.5% respectively. The S&P 500 hit its first all-time high in two years in January and has since achieved 31 more. This marks the fifth best first half for the S&P 500 in the last 25 years. Notably, four stocks (Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon) contributed more than half of the gain. Historically, strong first halves often lead to strong second halves, with the S&P 500 rallying further in 18 out of 22 instances since 1950 when it was up at least 10% in the first half. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) is running at 2.6%, its slowest since 2021, and is expected to cool further towards the 2% target. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to join other central banks in the global easing cycle, with 21 out of 37 central banks tracked cutting interest rates. Key events in the first half of 2024 include the US SEC approving eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs, the highest annual rise in auto insurance premiums in nearly half a century, Japan landing a spacecraft on the Moon, and the US Labor Department reporting a 3.3% annualized growth in Q4 2023 GDP. Other notable events include Nvidia adding nearly $280B to its market value in a single day, the Nikkei average reaching its highest-ever level, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassing 40,000 points for the first time. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the first half of 2024, starting at 4.03% on January 10 and reaching 4.25% by June 25. Significant events impacting the yield included the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, the rise in auto insurance premiums, and various geopolitical and economic developments. The industrial sector, along with other sectors, benefited from these market conditions, contributing to the overall positive performance in the first half of 2024.",

    "Document1": "More From Forbes\nHow Overvalued Is Tesla\u2019s Stock, Really?\nThe logo of the Tesla Inc is seen on a screen of a smartphone next to a screen with an illustration ... [+] ofthe stock market. Tesla is listed in Nasdaq. The Nasdaq is the second-largest stock exchange in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo by Alexander Pohl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nDespite Tesla\u2019s\nTSLA\nstock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis of the report\u2019s methodology suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%.\nTwo psychological elements underlie the behavioral analysis of the report. Both were emphasized by the late psychologist Daniel Kahneman. The first is downplaying base rates, and the second is representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past. Representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\nBack Of The Envelope Calculation\nWhile some investors like to dig into the details of analyst reports, many do not. For those who do not, this section presents a brief back of the envelope calculation to register the point about Tesla\u2019s potential overvaluation. Readers who just want a quick sense of the issue can read this section and skip to the conclusion.\nDuring April 2024, the JPMorgan reports on Tesla estimate that at the end of 2024, Tesla\u2019s enterprise value will be $331,483 million. A key input in arriving at this value is an estimate of the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable.\nHere acceptable profitability is measured by a rate of return, the cost of capital. Actual profitability is measured by the return on invested capital. When they are equal, the firm is said to exactly earn its cost of capital.\nBillionaire Mark Cuban Issues Post Halving Bitcoin Warning Amid\nUnprecedented\nCrypto Fee Price\nChaos\nAEW Dynasty 2024 Results\nWinners And Grades As Swerve Makes History\nWho Is David Pecker\nWhy He s Testifying Against Trump In Hush Money Trial\nThe base rate issue is that in the long run, most companies do not earn more than their cost of capital. That is, return on invested capital does not exceed the cost of capital.\nIf the JPMorgan analysts expect that Tesla will exactly earn its cost of capital going forward, then there is a straightforward calculation to estimate its fundamental value at the end of 2024: Simply divide the estimate of Tesla\u2019s 2025 value of EBIT after tax, or EBI, by Tesla\u2019s weighted average cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%. The result is $108,406 million, which is roughly one third of the JPMorgan estimate.\nI suggest a reason why the JPMorgan estimate of enterprise value could be three times the estimate from the simple formula: The JPMorgan analysts assume that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. Is the assumption reasonable? The evidence presented below suggests not.\nTesla\u2019s Return On Invested Capital\nPrior to 2020, Tesla\u2019s return on invested capital was negative. In 2020, it barely turned positive. However, in 2021, it rose to 14%, then to 23% in 2022 and then dropped slightly to 20% in 2023. Therefore, in the last three years, Tesla did indeed earn more than its cost of capital.\nHowever, Tesla\u2019s situation has changed. The JPMorgan analysts gave Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight, indicating that Tesla\u2019s deteriorating fundamentals relate to decreased demand for its vehicles, not decreased supply. The New York Times\nNYT\ndescribes how Tesla is now facing stiff competition for electric vehicles from American, Korean, Chinese and European automobile manufacturers, such as Ford, BYD, and BMW. These firms all have big EV product lines and growing sales. Indeed, during the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD briefly became the world\u2019s largest seller of EVs.\nStandard textbooks in economics and finance clearly state that for a company to earn more than its cost of capital in the long run, it must have some sustainable competitive advantage. Companies that earn more than their costs of capital attract competitors, and competition puts downward pressure on prices and profit margins. Tesla is now cutting prices and profit margins to compete with its competitors. Going forward, this decision will place significant pressure on the company\u2019s ROIC.\nReturn On Capital, Base Rates, And Representativeness\nComputing enterprise value requires a focus on the long run. Consider this question: Over the long run, what percentage of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills? This is a question about a base rate.\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work provides the answer, which is 4%. Think of 4% as the base rate. Put another way, over the long run, 96% of publicly traded stocks fail to outperform the Treasury bill rate.\nAmazon\nAMZN\nand Apple\nAAPL\nearn more than Treasury bills. In May 2017, analysts at Morgan Stanley\nMS\nmade the following statement: \u201cThe bull case on Tesla is that it can become the next Amazon or Apple.\u201d The title of the report is \u201cThe Price of Ambition: Downgrade to EW.\u201d Keep in mind that the simple valuation formula refers to companies earning their cost of capital, not earning the rate on Treasury bills. So, the question for valuing Tesla becomes whether it is reasonable to expect that going forward, the firm\u2019s ROIC will match its 11.8% cost of capital. Given the base rate, the odds are against it.\nIn respect to representativeness, Amazon and Apple serve as stereotypes. Analysts and investors rely on representativeness for their judgments when they do two things. First, they view Amazon and Apple as emblematic of companies with the highest performing stocks. Second they make valuation judgements about Tesla based on their perceptions of how representative is Tesla of the class of companies having the highest performing stocks.\nDiscounted Free Cash Flow Analysis\nThe analysts at JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley do not use the simple valuation EBI/WACC-formula which I described above. Instead, they use a free cash flow counterpart, which applies a multiple to an estimate of a future free cash flow. For example, the JPMorgan analysts apply a multiple of 83 to their 2025-free cash flow estimate of $2,571 million for Tesla.\nAs a general matter, applying a multiple is fine, as long as the multiple is reasonable. The thing about using 83 is that it implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital going forward. That is why, I suggest, the JPMorgan estimate of $100 per share for Tesla\u2019s fundamental enterprise value is too high.\nIt is straightforward to ascertain the value of the multiple corresponding to any firm exactly earning its cost of capital. First, estimate the long-term growth rate for the company\u2019s free cash flow. Call this g. Compute the ratio (1+g)/(WACC-g). Now tie g to the assumption that the firm will exactly earn its cost of capital. The textbook formula for g in this case is g = retention rate x WACC. The retention rate is the ratio of a company\u2019s capital expenditures net of depreciation to the sum of its unlevered free cash flow and capex net of depreciation.\nAnalysts routinely assume values for free cash flow growth rates that are higher than the textbook formula. Moreover, these assumptions are buried in the multiples they use. If you do the math, you will discover that JPMorgan\u2019s implicit value of g is 11% per year. The textbook formula indicates that if Tesla is expected to earn its costs of capital exactly, the corresponding value of g would be 8.4%. Using 11% for g when 8.4% is warranted is a bias known as growth opportunities bias.\nUsing 8.4% will produce an estimate of enterprise value for Tesla that is in the neighborhood of what you get using the simple EBI/WACC formula. Try it.\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018. Once positive, they grew quickly through 2021. In 2020, they grew at 128.6% and in 2021 at 19.7%. However, in 2022 growth turned negative at -25.5%, and in 2023 it dropped further to -175.9%.\nSentiment\nThe upshot of the Tesla\u2019s fundamental value being so far below its market price is that Tesla\u2019s price mostly reflects optimistic sentiment. On this point, the JPMorgan report establishes a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock of $115, not $100. In this respect, the report\u2019s methodology arrives at $115 by taking a 50-50 combination of its $100 estimate of DCF-based fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on multiples such as price-to-earnings and price-to-sales. The multiples approach captures market-wide sentiment, but not sentiment unique to Tesla.\nBehavioral asset pricing theory focuses on the decomposition of market prices into a fundamental component and a sentiment component. The target price approach I favor would place a lower weight on fundamental value computed using the EBI/WACC formula, a higher weight on the multiples approach, and the addition of a component to account for Tesla-specific sentiment.\nThe Tesla-specific component is important. For years, the JPMorgan analysts have assigned Tesla\u2019s stock a recommendation of Underweight. This was the case in July 2020 when Tesla\u2019s stock was trading at $1,592. At the time, the JPMorgan analysts\u2019 target price was $325, 80% below the market price. Its estimate of fundamental value per share was $295 and its multiple-based counterpart was $356. Remember, 2020 was a time when Tesla\u2019s free cash flow growth was high, and its ROIC had just turned positive. In July 2021, a year, later, Tesla\u2019s stock increased by 140%, vividly demonstrating the power of sentiment. It is a mistake to think that prices revert to fundamental value quickly, or even move in the right direction.\nGeneral Takeaways\nSentiment refers to biased reactions to changing fundamentals. The history of Tesla\u2019s stock illustrates just how important sentiment can be in the short-to-medium terms.\nAnalysts might serve the investing public better, for all stocks, not just Tesla, by structuring the valuation portions of their reports to decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components. In doing so, they could also be transparent about base rates for ROIC and free cash flow growth rates. Specifically, they can exercise caution about giving due weight to base rates and avoiding representativeness bias, in an effort to mitigate growth opportunity bias. Doing so just might lead market prices to more accurately reflect their corresponding fundamental values.\nI contacted Media Relations at JPMorgan to offer the firm an opportunity to respond to the points in this post. However, the firm\u2019s policy is not to comment on the methodology in analyst reports.",

Going back a bit further, to just after the March 2020 Covid crash, the performance of both stocks has been far more palatable, with GOOG up 126% in since March 13, 2020, vs. a 63% gain for AMZN. Over the last five years, GOOG is up 156% vs. an 83% gain in AMZN.\nThose are strong returns for GOOG, especially when compared to the 64% return in the S&P 500 in the last five years. Amazon though? Not so much. Now the question is: Can AMZN and GOOG repeat or beat that performance over the next five years?\n[text_ad]\nIt would be foolish to doubt either company at this point. That said, no stock continues to grow at a breakneck pace forever. Just ask anyone who bought General Electric (GE) 10 or 15 years ago, when it ranked among the 10 largest companies in the world by market cap. So chances are, one or both of these blue-chip tech stocks will start to slow in the years ahead.\nGiven that backdrop, I thought it might be a fun exercise to examine which tech giant stock is better positioned for future growth.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at AMZN stock and GOOG stock, broken into a few key numbers:\nTrailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\nForward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\nEstimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\nEstimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\nCash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\nInstitutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\nThat comparison tells us that AMZN is still the more overvalued stock. However, until recently it had been the faster-growing company on both the top and bottom lines; and it had been since 2016. That was also the year Amazon first turned consistently profitable.\nThat said, Google has way more cash than Amazon - nearly double in terms of total cash, with roughly a fifth as much debt. Considering that Amazon brings in nearly twice as much revenue as Google annually (though that gap is closing), that means that Amazon has been way more willing to spend its cash on things that will grow the company - the Amazon Prime Video streaming service that is rivaling Netflix these days; a new foray into live sports with NFL broadcasts; the Amazon Echo, Amazon Web Services, etc. Google looks more like a cash hoarder. The result is that Amazon stock has grown much faster than GOOG stock in the last decade, though that has certainly changed in the last two years.\nThe guess here is that Google will start loosening its purse strings in the coming years, devoting it to new, exciting products like the long-anticipated and recently released Google Pixel Watch intended to rival the Apple Watch, a new Pixel smartphone, or perhaps Google will join Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Disney in the big-money streaming video wars (YouTube did make a splash buying the NFL broadcast rights). Regardless of what it comes up with, bet on Google spending more of its $120 billion cash stockpile soon. If it does, that could capture investors\u2019 attention the way Amazon did up until the last few years.\nYou can\u2019t go wrong with either of these growth stocks. If you bought both of them five, 10 or even 15 years ago, you\u2019ve made a LOT of money. But AMZN has been the better performer, at least up until recently. I think that might change in the years to come. Between its cash stockpile, untapped potential revenue streams, and cheaper valuation, I like GOOG stock to outperform AMZN in the next five years. In fact, that shift already seems to be taking place, as the last few years have shown. It could be the start of a longer-term role reversal between two of the biggest, baddest tech stocks on the block.\nFurthermore, after such extreme selling last year, both these stocks are still trading below their 2021 levels despite a furious run-up to start this year. You could buy both (or either, although I prefer GOOG); either way, an investment in GOOG stock will likely turn out quite well five years from now.\nFor a list of the stocks that actually have momentum after a tough earnings season, consider taking a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Despite Tesla\u2019s stock having lost more than 60% of its value since November 2021, recent analyst reports from JPMorgan indicate that the stock would have to drop by at least 35% more from its current level to reach fundamental value. However, a behavioral analysis suggests that the number might be closer to 75% than 35%. Two psychological elements underlie this analysis: downplaying base rates and representativeness. Base rates refer to the rates at which relevant events have occurred in the past, while representativeness is the misuse of stereotypic thinking.\n\nDuring April 2024, JPMorgan reports estimated Tesla\u2019s enterprise value at the end of 2024 to be $331,483 million. A key input in this valuation is the minimum level of future profitability Tesla\u2019s investors would find acceptable, measured by the cost of capital. The report also estimates Tesla\u2019s EBIT during 2025 to be $12,792 million and its WACC to be 11.8%, resulting in a fundamental value of $108,406 million, roughly one-third of the JPMorgan estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) was negative prior to 2020, barely positive in 2020, and rose to 14% in 2021, 23% in 2022, and slightly dropped to 20% in 2023. However, Tesla now faces stiff competition from other EV manufacturers, leading to price cuts and pressure on profit margins. This competition challenges the assumption that Tesla will continue to earn more than its cost of capital.\n\nFinancial economist Hank Bessembinder\u2019s work shows that only 4% of publicly traded companies earn more than Treasury bills in the long run. Given this base rate, it is unlikely that Tesla will continue to outperform. Analysts often use representativeness, comparing Tesla to high-performing companies like Amazon and Apple, which can lead to biased valuations.\n\nJPMorgan and Morgan Stanley analysts use a discounted free cash flow analysis, applying a multiple to future free cash flow estimates. JPMorgan\u2019s multiple of 83 implies an expectation that Tesla will earn much more than its cost of capital. However, using a more conservative growth rate of 8.4% instead of 11% would produce a lower enterprise value estimate.\n\nTesla\u2019s free cash flows were negative until 2018, grew quickly through 2021, but turned negative in 2022 and 2023. The JPMorgan report sets a December 2024 target price for Tesla\u2019s stock at $115, combining a $100 estimate of fundamental value and a $130 estimate based on market sentiment. Behavioral asset pricing theory suggests that Tesla\u2019s market price reflects optimistic sentiment rather than fundamental value.\n\nIn summary, sentiment plays a significant role in Tesla\u2019s stock price. Analysts should decompose target prices into fundamental and sentiment components, be transparent about base rates, and avoid representativeness bias to provide more accurate valuations.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "AMZN Stock vs. GOOG Stock: Which Is the Better Buy Today?\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOG) are two of the world\u2019s most recognizable brands and Wall Street\u2019s most coveted stocks. Both stocks were affected by the growth stock sell-off of 2022, with GOOG down 6% and AMZN down 13% since the start of 2022. Since the March 2020 Covid crash, GOOG is up 126% compared to AMZN's 63%. Over the last five years, GOOG has risen 156% versus AMZN's 83%, outperforming the S&P 500's 64% return.\n\nKey numbers:\n- Trailing P/Es: AMZN 76, GOOG 26\n- Forward P/Es: AMZN 42, GOOG 20\n- Estimated 2023 revenue growth: AMZN 11%, GOOG 8.2%\n- Estimated 2023 EPS growth: AMZN 1,089%, GOOG 51.4%\n- Cash per share: AMZN $6.21, GOOG $9.58\n- Institutional ownership: AMZN 61%, GOOG 62%\n\nAMZN is more overvalued but has historically grown faster. Google has more cash and less debt, with a $120 billion cash stockpile. Amazon has been more aggressive in spending on growth initiatives like Amazon Prime Video, NFL broadcasts, Amazon Echo, and Amazon Web Services. Google, on the other hand, has been more conservative but is expected to start spending more on new products like the Google Pixel Watch and potentially entering the streaming video market.\n\nBoth stocks are strong growth stocks, but GOOG may outperform AMZN in the next five years due to its cash reserves, potential new revenue streams, and cheaper valuation. Despite recent sell-offs, both stocks are trading below their 2021 levels, making them attractive buys. An investment in GOOG stock is likely to perform well over the next five years.\n\nFor more details, consider a trial subscription to Cabot Top Ten Trader for a list of stocks set to jump next week.",

This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%).

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Access to Care Ranking 2024\n\nThe Access Ranking indicates the level of access to mental health care within a state, including insurance, treatment, quality and cost of insurance, special education, and mental health workforce availability. A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems. State prevalence ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\n24.58% of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days each month could not see a doctor due to costs, a 2% increase from last year. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The rate is shown per 1,000 students, with state rates ranging from 28.01 per 1,000 in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 in Alabama.\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. As of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, with only 27% of the need being met. The state rate ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Health Divide: The maternity care crisis worsens, plus stubborn gaps in U.S. fetal mortality rates\n\nMore than 35% of U.S. counties are 'maternity care deserts,' affecting over 2.3 million women of reproductive age who live in counties without a birthing facility or obstetric clinician, according to the March of Dimes' 2024 report. States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women. Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females. Factors contributing to these disparities include racial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination, and access to quality care.\n\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21), and lowest in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, and Montana. Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Access to Care Ranking 2024\n\nThe Access Ranking indicates the level of access to mental health care within a state, including insurance, treatment, quality and cost of insurance, special education, and mental health workforce availability. A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems. State prevalence ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\n24.58% of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days each month could not see a doctor due to costs, a 2% increase from last year. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The rate is shown per 1,000 students, with state rates ranging from 28.01 per 1,000 in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 in Alabama.\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. As of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, with only 27% of the need being met. The state rate ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The Health Divide: The maternity care crisis worsens, plus stubborn gaps in U.S. fetal mortality rates\n\nMore than 35% of U.S. counties are 'maternity care deserts,' affecting over 2.3 million women of reproductive age who live in counties without a birthing facility or obstetric clinician, according to the March of Dimes' 2024 report. States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications.

Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females. Factors contributing to these disparities include racial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination, and access to quality care.\n\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21), and lowest in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, and Montana. Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Access to Care Ranking 2024\n\nThe Access Ranking indicates the level of access to mental health care within a state, including insurance, treatment, quality and cost of insurance, special education, and mental health workforce availability. A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems. State prevalence ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\n24.58% of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days each month could not see a doctor due to costs, a 2% increase from last year. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).

    "Summarized_Document2": "The Health Divide: The maternity care crisis worsens, plus stubborn gaps in U.S. fetal mortality rates\n\nMore than 35% of U.S. counties are 'maternity care deserts,' affecting over 2.3 million women of reproductive age who live in counties without a birthing facility or obstetric clinician, according to the March of Dimes' 2024 report. States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women. Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females. Factors contributing to these disparities include racial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination, and access to quality care.\n\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21), and lowest in New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut, and Montana. Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

States that have the highest percentages of counties without access to maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma and Nebraska.\n\"For too many families across the U.S., the ability to have a healthy pregnancy depends on where they live,\" said Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, in\u00a0a statement. \"Our 2024 report underscores that maternity care is still not prioritized in our country and there is an urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S. and to ensure that these families have access to the care they need and deserve.\"\nWomen living in places without adequate maternity care face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth, among other health complications, the report says. The rates of inadequate prenatal care are higher among women of color and low-income women.\u00a0\u00a0\nRecent hospital closures and reductions in obstetric services have accelerated the spread of these deserts. Since the organization last published a report in 2022, more than 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units. As a result, pregnant people have to travel farther for maternity care, or seek emergency services. Among the solutions the report suggested are mobile health centers, which provide maternal and infant health services to areas otherwise lacking them.\nA lack of OB-GYNs is adding to the problem, with physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance among the factors limiting the supply of specialists, according to a\u00a02022-published article\u00a0in the World Journal of Gynecology & Women\u2019s Health.\u00a0\nAnother more recent factor shaping the OB-GYN workforce\u00a0\u00a0is the shifting abortion landscape, as\u00a0Alejandra O\u2019Connell-Domenech\u00a0reported earlier this year for\u00a0The Hill.\u00a0The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn federal protections for abortion had led to declines in applications to OB/GYN residency programs \u201cfar more significantly in the\u00a013 states\u00a0that enacted complete abortion bans after the Dobbs ruling,\" according to\u00a0American Medical Association\u00a0research.\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\u00a0\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, according to the National Center for Health Statistics\u2019 newly\u00a0released 2022 report.\u00a0\u00a0\nWith so much public health and\u00a0media attention\u00a0focused on infant mortality, the latest measure \u2014 which looks at fetal deaths at 20 weeks gestation or more \u2014 marks progress on \u201ca major but often overlooked public health issue,\u201d the report notes.\u00a0\nThe fetal mortality rate dropped from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline.\nBut a closer look within the numbers tells a different story of persistent disparities. For example, the most recent fetal mortality rate was highest for Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders remains nearly twice that experienced by white women \u2014 about 10 deaths per 1,000 compared to five. The lowest rate was found among Asian females.\u00a0\nWhile the report does not explore reasons for the racial disparities, USA Today reporter\u00a0Eduardo Cuevas wrote\u00a0that experts have suggested overall \u201cracial health disparities, preexisting conditions, structural discrimination and access to quality care may be factors.\u201d\nUsha Ranji,\u00a0associate director for women\u2019s health policy at the research nonprofit KFF, also pointed to the \u201cweathering effect\u201d of stress and other factors that influence adverse health outcomes for Black mothers and other women of color.\u00a0\nFetal mortality rates were highest in Mississippi (6.22), Arkansas (5.38), and Alabama (5.21). New Mexico, Texas, Connecticut and Montana were among the states with the lowest rates.\nAmong the risk factors described in the report were maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and pregnancies carrying more than one fetus. The measure does not include abortions.\u00a0\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\u00a0\nThere are major disparities in vision coverage nationwide for adults with Medicaid health insurance.\u00a0\nThat\u2019s the overarching finding of a new analysis recently published in Health Affairs.\u00a0The findings offer a state-by-state analysis of adult Medicaid benefits for both fee-for-service and managed care plans.\u00a0\u00a0Among the most striking statistics: About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage.\u00a0\nThe study, which was based on state Medicaid policies from 2022 to 2023, also noted that 12% of adults with Medicaid, or 6.5 million people, live in states that didn\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in the two-thirds of the states that did provide routine eye care, enrollees were required to pay a share of costs in some way.\u00a0\nWhile the federal government establishes overarching rules for Medicaid, the national health insurance for low-income adults and children, states run their own programs. That means they can modify their coverage policies, such as whether eye exams and eyeglasses for adults are fully covered. (For children, federal law provides for vision services, regardless of the state.)\u00a0\nThe study highlights a patchwork of coverage nationwide, with seven states offering no coverage for exams or glasses for adults.\u00a0\nThese coverage gaps translate into real-world health impacts. Eye exams are vital in identifying eye diseases early, when treatment can prevent vision loss. Exams are also vital for prescription glasses to correct refractive errors, the leading cause of vision impairment in the country. Paying for your own exam without insurance costs about $485, the study notes.\u00a0\n\u201cOur study clearly shows that there are opportunities to expand coverage of routine vision services at the state level, and based on previous research, we expect more generous coverage would reduce rates of vision impairment, improve quality of life, and promote health equity,\u201d said Brandy Lipton, the study\u2019s lead author and associate professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine in a\u00a0release\u00a0on the findings.\u00a0\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\u00a0\u00a0\nThe data being used to build artificial intelligence could quickly compound the racial bias that already plagues the health care system, reports STAT\u2019s Katie Palmer in\u00a0the latest installment in the outlet\u2019s \u201cEmbedded Bias\u201d series.\nBut, the article asks, could these same new tech tools also deliver a better path forward?\u00a0\nFor example, Palmer describes how Olga Kravchenko, a biomedical informatician at the University of Pittsburgh, used ChatGPT to help identify patterns in ICU care. She found that patients labeled as Native American and Caucasian were more likely to use a ventilator compared to other racial groups. The reasons for the disparity are unknown but experts theorized that Indigenous Americans might arrive to the ICU sicker, while white patients might be given privileged access to ventilators.\n\u201cThe answers to those questions are rarely clear,\u201d Palmer writes. \u201cBut asking why a racial disparity appears in data is a critical step to ensuring that its signal doesn\u2019t get misused in a predictive algorithm, for example, that helps hospitals determine who\u2019s most likely to benefit from a limited supply of ventilators.\u201d\nWith so much bias already baked into today\u2019s health care data, solutions are complicated. One idea: \u201ca \u2018bias glossary\u2019 for every medical dataset, a summary of the data distortions that responsible model developers should be careful to avoid.\u201d\nThis month, the journal\u00a0npj Digital Medicine also explored \u201cfundamental shortcomings\u201d in health care AI, and the challenges inherent in new models \u2014 such as \u201cbias exhaust,\u201d or the residual biases in AI that emerge from actual systemic discrepancies in care. Even though a new AI tool might appear accurate in a controlled testing environment, that might not translate to patient care at the bedside, the authors explain. They also point to the importance of providing developers \u201cdiverse, comprehensive clinical datasets to train models on actual patient populations and scenarios.\u201d\nWhat we\u2019re reading\nRelated Articles\nThe Center for Health Journalism at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism \n734 W.

States with the highest percentages of counties lacking maternity care include North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Oklahoma, and Nebraska. Dr. Amanda Williams, March of Dimes\u2019 chief medical officer, emphasized the urgent need for systemic changes to improve outcomes for moms and babies in the U.S.\n\nWomen in these areas face a 13% higher risk of preterm birth and other health complications.

Since 2022, over 100 hospitals have closed their obstetric units, forcing pregnant individuals to travel farther for care or seek emergency services. Solutions suggested include mobile health centers.\n\nA lack of OB-GYNs, driven by factors like physician burnout, lower reimbursement rates, and a desire for better work-life balance, exacerbates the problem. The shifting abortion landscape, particularly after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn federal protections for abortion, has also led to declines in OB/GYN residency applications, especially in the 13 states with complete abortion bans.\n\nCDC: Fetal mortality reaches historic low, but racial inequities persist\n\nFetal deaths have reached a historic low, with the rate dropping from 5.73 deaths per 1,000 births in 2021 to 5.48 in 2022, a 4% decline. However, disparities persist, with the highest rates among Black women and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, nearly twice that of white women. The lowest rate was among Asian females.

Risk factors include maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nFor adults on Medicaid, where you live affects your vision coverage\n\nA new analysis in Health Affairs highlights major disparities in vision coverage for adults with Medicaid. About 27% of adult Medicaid enrollees live in states without eyeglass coverage, and 12% live in states that don\u2019t cover routine eye exams. Even in states that provide routine eye care, enrollees often have to share costs.\n\nThe study underscores the importance of eye exams in identifying diseases early and providing prescription glasses. Without insurance, an eye exam costs about $485. Expanding coverage could reduce vision impairment rates, improve quality of life, and promote health equity.\n\nHow AI can avoid embedded health bias\n\nArtificial intelligence could compound existing racial biases in healthcare, but it also has the potential to offer better solutions. For example, Olga Kravchenko used ChatGPT to identify patterns in ICU care, finding disparities in ventilator use among different racial groups. Addressing why these disparities appear is crucial to prevent misuse in predictive algorithms.\n\nThe journal npj Digital Medicine discusses the 'bias exhaust' in AI, where residual biases from systemic discrepancies in care affect new models. Providing developers with diverse, comprehensive clinical datasets is essential for training models on actual patient populations and scenarios.",

A high Access Ranking\u00a0(1-13) indicates that a state provides relatively more access to insurance and mental health\u00a0treatment than those ranked 39-51.\nThe eight measures that make up the Access Ranking include:\n\n\n\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness.\nIn 2022, 64% of adults who were uninsured said that they did not have health insurance because they could not afford it.\nThe state prevalence of uninsured adults with mental illness ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\nAdults with SUD Who Needed But Did Not Receive Treatment\nOver three-quarters (76.9%) of all adults with a substance use disorder did not receive the treatment they needed.\nMost adults with SUD who sought or thought about receiving treatment reported they didn\u2019t because they thought they should have been able to handle their drug or alcohol use on their own (75.4%).\nThis was followed by: Not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop or cut back using alcohol or drugs (48.4%), thought it would cost too much (47.7%), and did not know how or where to get treatment (47.3%).\nThe state prevalence of adults with SUD with unmet treatment needs ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\n10.2% of adults who experienced a mental illness in the past year had private health insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems.\nThe state prevalence of adults with AMI whose private insurance did not cover mental or emotional problems ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs\n24.58% of adults who reported experiencing 14 or more mentally unhealthy days each month were not able to see a doctor due to costs. This was a 2% increase over last year\u2019s report.\nHigh costs of mental health care are a critical barrier to access. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading. Unfortunately, doing so hides the fact that the percentages are significantly lower.\nThe state rate of students identified as having an emotional disturbance for an IEP ranges from 28.01 per 1,000 students in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 students in Alabama.\n\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\nMental Health Workforce Availability\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. The term \u201cmental health provider\u201d includes psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, counselors, marriage and family therapists, and advanced practice nurses specializing in mental health care.\nAs of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, and only 27% of the mental health need in shortage areas was being met by mental health providers. Over the next 15 years, the National Center for Health Workforce Analysis has projected increasing shortages for several behavioral health providers, including psychologists, psychiatrists, and mental health and addiction counselors.\nThe state rate of mental health workforce ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.\nThe State of Mental Health in America\n2024 STATISTICS\nAccess to Care\nAbout Us\nGet Help\nGet Active\nGet Information\n\n                500 Montgomery Street,\n                \n                Suite 820\n                \n                Alexandria, VA. 22314\n                \n\n                Phone (703) 684.7722\n                \n                Toll Free (800) 969.6642\n                \n                Fax (703) 684.5968\n              \nFooter menu\n",

Contributing factors include growing healthcare costs, stricter payer reimbursement policies, and claims processing errors. Providers are seeing an uptick in nonpayment, plus an added burden on administrative staff, disrupted patient care, and hits to the bottom line.\nExperian Health surveyed over 200 healthcare professionals, primarily in executive or management roles, to better understand the current state of claims. The findings of the State of Claims 2024 report break down the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, reasons for denials, and providers\u2019 concerns about reimbursement.\nRising healthcare costs: who will foot the bill?\nThe U.S. healthcare system is the most expensive in the world, and costs continue to rise. In 2022, healthcare spending reached $4.5 trillion, a threefold increase from $1.4 trillion in 2000. In 2023, costs rose 7.5% to $4.8 trillion. Paying for healthcare is becoming more and more out of reach for patients and causing great concern. Over three-quarters (77%) of providers worry patients will skip out on their medical bills.\nPayer reimbursement challenges are also weighing heavily on healthcare leaders\u2019 minds. More than 75% are worried about nonpayment due to ever-evolving payer policy changes. They also have concerns about the pre-authorization struggles that have continued since 2022, as reported in the State of Claims 2022 survey. Hospitals are particularly feeling the financial pinch of operating within such an expensive environment and face uncertainties about meeting financial obligations on top of other major post-pandemic challenges like staff shortages.\nThe impact of claims denials\nProviders continue to see claims being denied in greater numbers. In 2022, 42% of respondents said denials are increasing. The number jumped to 77% in 2024. Similarly, the time it takes to be reimbursed is increasing, per 67% of respondents. That number was 51% in 2022.\nIn 2024, 84% of healthcare organizations\u00a0will make reducing denied claims a top priority. The Journal of Managed Care & Specialty Pharmacy reports that the burden of denied claims totals around $260 billion\u00a0annually. The impact of claim denials is far-reaching, affecting the patient experience and revenue cycles. Struggles with claims also burden staff and drain resources, contributing to even more losses.\nThe growing challenge of data collection, verification and authorization\nSuccessful claims processing depends on accuracy. However, achieving accuracy in data collection, verification, and authorization processes remains a continued challenge for claims management teams. Nearly half of respondents (46%) in the State of Claims 2024 report identified missing or inaccurate information as the primary cause for denial. Inaccurate or missing data also creates extra steps in claims processing, resulting in the need for secondary checks and \u201cwasted\u201d healthcare dollars. Survey respondents reported using multiple solutions to collect all the necessary patient data for claims, with some using as many as four different products.\nLeveling the playing field in claims management with technology\nStaying on top of reimbursement requirements and processes is complex, resource-demanding and time-consuming. Inaccuracies commonplace with manual processing exacerbate issues and further extend processing and reimbursement times. However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing.\n\u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d\nDuring the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used\u00a0this type of technology.\nHere\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates:\n\nManage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission.\nSubmit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow.\nEliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly.\nImprove cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions.\nPrevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue.\n\nAdaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.\nDownload the State of Claims 2024 report to get the latest health insurance claim denial statistics, or contact us to learn how Experian Health can help with better claims management.\nGet the report Claims management solutions\n\nPrev\n\nRelated Posts\n\nWhat is revenue cycle management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nThis blog examines revenue cycle management (RCM) in healthcare process as a whole: what it is, how it works, and more.\nPublished: September 10, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nWhat is denial management in healthcare?\nFeatured \nDiscover the importance of healthcare denial management and get strategies to minimize claim denials and improve your financial performance.\nPublished: September 6, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\n\nRevenue cycle management best practices: a guide f...\nFeatured \nDiscover revenue cycle management best practices healthcare leaders should follow to optimize workflows and promote financial stability.\nPublished: August 13, 2024 by Experian Health\nRead More\nSubscribe to our blog\nEnter your name and email for the latest updates.\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nTags\nai advantage ai advantage denial triage ai advantage predictive denials artificial intelligence automation claim denials claims Claim Scrubber claims management ClaimSource collections Collections Optimization Manager consumer data Coverage Discovery COVID-19 data Data and Analytics digital front door identity management Insurance Eligibility Verification online scheduling patient access patient access curator Patient Collections patient engagement patient estimates patient experience patient financial advisor patient financial clearance patient identity patient payment patient payment estimates patient portal patient registration patient satisfaction patient schedule patientsimple price transparency pymnts registration accelerator Revenue Cycle Management self-scheduling social determinants of health state of claims 2022 state of patient access\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nSubscribe\nSubscribe to the Experian Health blog\nGet the latest industry news and updates!\nEmail * \nFirst Name * \nLast Name * \nCountry *\nSubscribe\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\n\n\n\nLegal Terms & Conditions\nPrivacy Center\nU.S. Data Privacy Policy\nAd Choices\nPress\nCareers\nInvestor Relations\nContact Us\n\nEXPERIAN'S DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION Learn more how Experian is committed\nDATA PRIVACY Your privacy choices\n\u00a9 2024 Experian Information Solutions, Inc.

However, automation and AI technology have proven effective at reducing claims denials and the burden of manual processing. \u201cAdding AI in claims processing cuts down denials significantly,\u201d Tom Bonner, Principal Product Manager at Experian Health, explains. AI automation quickly flags errors, allowing claims editing before payer submission. It\u2019s not science fiction\u2014AI is the tool hospitals need for better healthcare claims denial prevention and management.\u201d During the pandemic, providers embraced new technology to meet immediate needs; however, that momentum slowed in recent years. In 2022, survey data revealed that 62% of providers were using some form of automation and AI technology. Yet, in 2024, only 31% said they used this type of technology. Here\u2019s how claims automation can help healthcare organizations improve claims success rates: Manage the entire claims process: Using an automated, scalable claims management system, like ClaimSource\u00ae, helps reduce denials and increase revenue. Providers can manage their entire claims cycle in a single application and ensure claims are clean before submission. Submit more accurate claims: An automated claims submission tool, like ClaimScrubber, helps identify errors that typically result in denials or underpayments before submission. This results in quicker payments, less time chasing aged accounts receivables, and improved cash flow. Eliminate manual processes: Providers that use Denials Workflow Manager can target claims that need attention immediately, managing denials more effectively and increasing reimbursements significantly. Improve cash flow: Enhanced Claim Status helps providers take an early-and-often approach to monitoring claim status in the adjudication process. It eliminates manual follow-up tasks, allowing providers to respond early and accurately to pended, returned-to-provider, denied or zero-pay transactions. Prevent denials: Experian Health\u2019s AI Advantage\u2122, an AI-driven platform, uses an organization\u2019s own historical claims data, plus Experian Health\u2019s sophisticated knowledge of payer rules, to continuously learn and adapt to an ever-changing payer policy landscape. This technology helps providers better predict and prevent claims denials, focus on high-priority claims, and boost overall revenue. Adaptation of technology is likely on the rise with 45% of healthcare leaders planning to invest in automation in the next six months. Over the next year, these investments could pay off if claims denials start to decrease as a result, prompting more healthcare organizations to boost investments in claims management technology.

In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness in the past year who sought or thought they should receive mental health care said the reason they did not receive it was because they thought it would cost too much.\nThe prevalence of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days a month who could not see a doctor due to cost ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\n\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\nYouth with MDE who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive any mental health treatment. This was defined as receiving treatment or counseling from a medical doctor or other professional or receiving medication for MDE.\nIn 2022, 48.3% of youth with MDE reported an unmet need for treatment. The main reason youth reported not receiving care was they felt they should have been able to handle their mental health on their own (86.9%). That was followed by being worried what people would think or say if they got treatment (59.8%), being worried that the information they shared would not be kept private (57.8%), and not knowing how or where to get treatment (55.5%).\nThe state prevalence of untreated youth with depression ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\n\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\nYouth with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems\nNationally, 8.5% of youth who are covered under private insurance do not have coverage for mental or emotional difficulties \u2013 totaling over 1 million youth.\nThe state prevalence of youth lacking mental health coverage ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\n\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024 \nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for an Individualized Education Program\nOnly .667% of students are identified as having an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP).\nFor purposes of an IEP, the term \u201cEmotional Disturbance\u201d is used to define youth with a mental or behavioral health condition that is affecting their educational performance.\nThe rate for this measure is shown as a rate per 1,000 students.\nThe calculation was made this way for ease of reading.

    "Document2": "Health Spending\nHow much and why 2024 premiums are expected to grow in Affordable Care Act Marketplaces\nBy Jared Ortaliza,\u00a0Matthew McGough,\u00a0Meghan Salaga,\u00a0Krutika Amin Twitter, and\u00a0Cynthia Cox Twitter\nKFF\nAugust 4, 2023\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nHealth insurers submit rate filings annually to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans for the coming year. A relatively small share of the population is enrolled in these plans (compared to the number in employer plans), but these filings are generally more detailed and publicly available. These filings provide insight into what factors insurers expect will drive health costs for the coming year.\nFor 2024, across 320 insurers participating in the 50 states and DC, this analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 6%. Based on a more detailed analysis of publicly available documents from 58 insurers, growth in health care prices stood out as a key factor driving costs in 2024. In addition to inflation, insurers also mention changes in pandemic-related costs and the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage, though the latter are having a small, if any, effect on premiums.\nMost proposed rate increases for 2024 ACA Marketplace plans fall between 2% and 10%, with a median increase of 6%\nAmong 320 ACA Marketplace participating insurers nationally, premium changes range from a drop of \u201315% to an increase of 100%, but most proposed premium changes for 2024 fall between about 2% and 10% (the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively). Of the 320 filings, 41 insurers proposed decreasing premiums. On the other end of the spectrum, 76 insurers requested premium increases greater than 10%. These filings are preliminary and may change during the rate review process. 2024 rates will be finalized in late summer. A table in the appendix shows proposed premium increases by state and insurer.\nThe rate increase for an insurer is a weighted average across all of its products within a state (i.e., bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans). These weighted average premium changes will differ from the percent change in the benchmark silver plan, which is the basis for federal subsidies. Most enrollees in this market receive a subsidy and are not expected to face these premium increases. However, premium increases could result in higher federal spending on subsidies.\nWhat\u2019s driving 2024 premium changes?\nThe chart above shows premium changes for 320 insurers across all 50 states and DC. For the subsequent sections, this analysis focuses on a subset of these rate filings (58 insurers across 11 states and DC) in more detail to understand the factors driving premium changes in 2024. These insurers and states were selected because they have earlier and more transparent (less redacted) public reporting of proposed rate justifications. For context, though, the 58 insurers reviewed in this section have somewhat higher proposed rate increases, with a median of 9%.\nHealth Spending\nHealth & Wellbeing\nInflation\nAs is the case in most years, medical trend \u2013 which includes growth in prices paid by insurers for medical services and medications, as well as growth in the utilization of health care \u2013 is a key driver of premium growth in 2024. Many insurers expect utilization to grow relative to 2022, but price growth is generally playing a larger role in medical trend than utilization is.\nOf the insurer rate filings reviewed in detail, and when an annualized trend was publicly available, the median medical trend was 8%, with most reporting trend in the 7-9% range.\n\u201cThe primary driver of the premium increase is the increases in the cost of healthcare.\u00a0 The increases are associated with increases in the \u201cunit\u201d cost of services primarily from hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical companies, coupled with increases in the consumption of services, or \u201cutilization\u201d, by members.\u201d \u2013 Anthem Health Plans, Kentucky\nWhile health sector prices typically outpace price growth in the rest of the economy, the last two years have been an exception. Recent medical price growth has been similar to past years, while growth in prices in the rest of the economy has grown at a faster than usual pace. As contracts between insurers and providers are typically negotiated for a year or more, medical inflation often lags that in the rest of the economy.\nLooking ahead to 2024, many insurers are expecting broader economic inflation to flow through to the health system and put upward pressure on premiums.\n\u201cSignificant inflation in the cost of goods and services in all sectors of the economy has had a profound impact on the cost of medical services, and BCBSRI expects to see substantial increases in provider unit costs for 2024.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island\n\u201cWe expect unit cost trends to be higher in 2023 and 2024 due to inflation, supply shortages and labor shortages. Inpatient hospital cost per day trends will be increasing as hospitals seek to recover from 2022 financial losses.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\n\u201cHealth insurance premiums must correspond with the cost of our members\u2019 medical care, which continues to rise at an unparalleled rate year after year and is projected to increase significantly in 2024. Rising medical costs are the primary driver of our proposed individual rates and increase requested premiums by 19.1%.\u201d \u2013 Highmark, New York\nIn addition to driving up prices paid by insurers to providers, inflation is also putting upward pressure on insurers\u2019 administrative costs, such as their own staffing costs.\n\u201cBlue Cross VT is increasing base administrative costs (see section 3.8.7), which has the effect of increasing the premiums by 0.1 percent for individuals and 0.3 percent for small groups. This modest increase reflects current and expected inflationary levels.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nCOVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency\nThis year, as they did in prior years, insurers acknowledge there is still uncertainty surrounding the future of the pandemic. With the end of the Public Health Emergency (PHE) this year, plans can now charge cost sharing for COVID-testing, which could have a downward effect on insurer costs and therefore a downward effect on premiums. Conversely, the COVID vaccine will be commercialized, meaning increased cost to insurers on a per-dose basis. The use of COVID-19 related prevention and treatment may diminish, though, if severe cases continue to be less common. On net, most insurers that publicly quantify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic in their filings expect their pandemic-related costs to decrease in 2024, having a small downward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMVP is assuming a 10% reduction in Covid testing costs in the projection period due to a utilization decrease, resulting in the removal of $0.31 PMPM. We expect demand for testing to decrease once cost sharing is reinstituted.\u201d \u2013 MVP Health Care, VT\n\u201cCosts related to COVID-19 decreased significantly in 2022 compared to 2021, and have reached a relatively consistent month-to-month level since March 2022. We expect 2023 and 2024 COVID related costs will continue at this lower level and possibly trend slightly downward as population immunity continues to grow.\u201d \u2013 Molina Healthcare of Washington\nThe pandemic had a significant downward effect on utilization of health care generally early on, particularly in 2020, but insurers are expecting a continued return to more normal levels going forward.\n\u201cWhile 2022 trends are lower than 2021, we expect utilization trends to moderate and return to pre-COVID-19 levels over 2023 and 2024.\u201d \u2013 Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Washington\nFew insurers mention pent up demand for the non-COVID care that was missed in 2020, and most of those that do mention it say the level of use they are expecting in the remainder of 2023 and 2024 is consistent with pre-pandemic trends. Very few insurers expect pent up demand to drive up costs in 2024.\nUnwinding of Medicaid continuous enrollment\nOn April 1, 2023, states started unwinding the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, resulting in at least 3.8 million people being disenrolled from Medicaid as of August 1, 2023. As a result, some people who have been disenrolled and deemed no longer eligible for Medicaid may enroll in the ACA marketplaces, where they may be eligible for subsidies.\nAbout half of the insurer rate filings reviewed do not mention Medicaid disenrollments in their 2024 premium filings. Those that mention the unwinding of Medicaid continuous coverage often say the impact on costs is difficult to predict, so they are not adjusting premiums. Several insurers say there will be an increase in their ACA enrollment, but no effect on market morbidity (i.e., the average health of enrollees), meaning no net impact on premiums.\n\u201cOur assumption is that the new members formerly in Medicaid will select a Blue Cross VT plan comparable to the current market share, about 60 percent, resulting in the Blue Cross VT individual market growing by 1,609 members and the Blue Cross VT small group market growing by 1,711 members. We further project that the new Medicaid members will have the same risk score relationship between the carriers as the existing market; therefore, the risk score impact is 1.000 for both carriers.\u201d \u2013 Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont\nA relatively small number of insurers expect the Medicaid unwinding to lead to a sicker group of people signing up for ACA plans, which would then have an upward effect on premiums.\n\u201cMedicaid redetermination and an otherwise shrinking market would lead to an increase in market average morbidity as relatively sicker members will enter and healthier members will leave the market.\u201d \u2013 BridgeSpan Health Company of Oregon\nOther Potential Drivers of Costs\nSome other factors that insurers mentioned in their 2024 rate filings, though much less commonly than the factors described above include:\nDiabetes and Weight Loss Drugs. Diabetic drugs, such as Semaglutide, are increasingly being utilized for weight loss. Given the increasing cost and use of Semaglutide and related drugs, a handful of insurers mention these drugs as having an upward effect on their pharmaceutical spending.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA extends pandemic-era enhanced subsidies through 2025, bringing down premium costs for most consumers in this market. Few insurers mentioned the impact of the IRA subsidies on premiums as there has been no change in the amount of the subsidy from last year.\nOther federal policy changes do not appear to be driving premiums. Among insurer filings reviewed, only one mentioned the impact of new restrictions on surprise billing but reported that no adjustment was made for it.\u00a0 None of the insurers reviewed mentioned the impact of the administrative fix to the \u201cfamily glitch\u201d in their filings.\nDiscussion\nSimilar to last year, it appears that 2024 rates may rise moderately. The median proposed rate increase is 6% nationally, with most proposed increases falling between 2% and 10%. Most enrollees in this market are subsidized and do not pay the full premium. However, premium increases can affect federal spending and the driving factors behind these increases illustrate broader trends driving health costs in 2024.\nA key driver of the increase in premiums in 2024 appears to be rising health prices. While prices for health services tend to grow every year, it also appears that inflation in the rest of the economy may now be starting to flow into the health sector. Rising prices and utilization are not necessarily specific to the ACA individual market. Similar levels of medical trend were observed in small group market filings as well.\nMany insurers that publicly quantified the impacts of the pandemic are projecting a decrease in COVID-19 related costs in 2024. There are multiple factors considered when evaluating the total impact of COVID-19 on costs. Some insurers mentioned higher costs associated with vaccine costs shifting to insurers. Resumed member cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, however, may have a downward effect on premiums as members seek out these services less due to their cost.\nRelative to inflation and the pandemic, fewer insurers mentioned the impact of the unwinding of the Medicaid continuous enrollment provision, and there was variation in how insurers project its impact on costs. A very small number of insurers mentioned the upward effects of diabetic therapy and weight loss drugs on pharmaceutical trends, mostly pointing to increasing costs and utilization of said drugs. Federal policy changes, like the administrative fix to the Family Glitch and the No Surprises Act, were rarely mentioned by insurers, if at all, despite their potential impacts on enrollment and costs.\nMethods\nProposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov for 320 insurers across 50 states and Washington, DC. Additionally, 58 insurer actuarial memoranda were collected from state rate review websites and were comprehensively reviewed to understand the factors contributing to rate changes. These 58 insurers were from the following Marketplaces: District of Columbia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, and Washington. Insurer actuarial memoranda were systematically evaluated for key words related to, but not limited to, medical trend, COVID-19 and the end of the Public Health Emergency, Medicaid redeterminations, Inflation Reduction Act subsidies, family glitch, surprise billing, telehealth, price transparency, and diabetes or weight loss drugs. Recorded medical trend values reported here are annualized.\nAppendix\nThe Peterson Center on Healthcare and KFF\u00a0are partnering to monitor how well the U.S. healthcare system is performing in terms of quality and cost.\nLooking for more data?\nFind out more details about U.S. healthcare from our updated dashboard.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\nGet the best of the Health System Tracker delivered to your inbox.\n\u00a9 2024 PETERSON-KFF Health System Tracker \u00a0 All Rights Reserved",
    "Summarized_Document1": "Access to Care Ranking 2024\n\nThe Access Ranking indicates the level of access to mental health care within a state, including insurance, treatment, quality and cost of insurance, special education, and mental health workforce availability. A high Access Ranking (1-13) means a state provides more access to insurance and mental health treatment compared to those ranked 39-51.\n\nAdults with AMI Who Are Uninsured 2024\n\n10.1% of adults (over 5.9 million people) with a mental illness are uninsured, compared to 9.3% of adults without a mental illness. In 2022, 64% of uninsured adults cited affordability as the reason. The state prevalence ranges from 2.60% in the District of Columbia to 22.90% in Texas.\n\nAdults with SUD who needed but did not receive treatment 2024\n\n76.9% of adults with a substance use disorder did not receive needed treatment. Reasons include self-management beliefs (75.4%), not ready to start treatment (58.6%), not ready to stop using substances (48.4%), cost concerns (47.7%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (47.3%). State prevalence ranges from 67.24% in West Virginia to 83.99% in Illinois.\n\nAdults with AMI with Private Insurance That Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n10.2% of adults with a mental illness had private insurance that did not cover mental or emotional problems. State prevalence ranges from 3.60% in Vermont to 24.70% in Mississippi.\n\nAdults Reporting 14+ Mentally Unhealthy Days a Month Who Could Not See a Doctor Due to Costs 2024\n\n24.58% of adults with 14+ mentally unhealthy days each month could not see a doctor due to costs, a 2% increase from last year. In 2022, 58.9% of adults with a mental illness cited cost as a barrier to receiving care. State prevalence ranges from 12.88% in Hawaii to 34.95% in Georgia.\n\nYouth with MDE Who Did Not Receive Mental Health Services 2024\n\n56.1% of youth with major depression did not receive mental health treatment. In 2022, 48.3% reported an unmet need for treatment, with reasons including self-management beliefs (86.9%), stigma (59.8%), privacy concerns (57.8%), and lack of knowledge on how or where to get treatment (55.5%). State prevalence ranges from 31.50% in the District of Columbia to 82.10% in South Dakota.\n\nYouth with Private Insurance that Did Not Cover Mental or Emotional Problems 2024\n\n8.5% of youth with private insurance lack coverage for mental or emotional difficulties, affecting over 1 million youth. State prevalence ranges from 2.30% in Connecticut to 17.00% in Mississippi.\n\nStudents (K+) Identified with Emotional Disturbance for An Individualized Education Program 2024\n\nOnly 0.667% of students are identified with an Emotional Disturbance (ED) for an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The rate is shown per 1,000 students, with state rates ranging from 28.01 per 1,000 in Vermont to 1.55 per 1,000 in Alabama.\n\nMental Health Workforce Availability 2024\n\nIn the U.S., there are 340 individuals for every one mental health provider. As of March 2024, over 122 million people lived in a mental health workforce shortage area, with only 27% of the need being met. The state rate ranges from 140:1 in Massachusetts to 800:1 in Alabama.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Health insurers submit annual rate filings to state regulators detailing expectations and rate changes for Affordable Care Act (ACA)-regulated health plans. For 2024, 320 insurers across 50 states and DC propose a median premium increase of 6%. The proposed changes range from a decrease of 15% to an increase of 100%, with most falling between 2% and 10%. These filings are preliminary and subject to change during the rate review process, with final rates expected in late summer.Key drivers of the 2024 premium changes include:1. **Health Spending and Inflation**: Medical trend, which includes growth in prices for medical services and medications, is a significant factor. The median medical trend is 8%, with most insurers reporting trends between 7-9%. Broader economic inflation is also expected to impact health system costs.2. **COVID-19 and the End of the Public Health Emergency**: Insurers expect a decrease in pandemic-related costs in 2024. The end of the Public Health Emergency allows plans to charge cost-sharing for COVID-testing, potentially reducing insurer costs. However, the commercialization of the COVID vaccine may increase costs.3. **Unwinding of Medicaid Continuous Enrollment**: As of August 1, 2023, at least 3.8 million people have been disenrolled from Medicaid. Some may enroll in ACA marketplaces, but the impact on premiums is uncertain. Some insurers expect no significant effect, while a few anticipate an increase in market morbidity.4. **Other Factors**: A few insurers mention the impact of diabetes and weight loss drugs, such as Semaglutide, on pharmaceutical spending. Federal policy changes like the Inflation Reduction Act and the No Surprises Act were rarely mentioned.The analysis includes data from 58 insurers across 11 states and DC, with a median proposed rate increase of 9%. The findings suggest that rising health prices and broader economic inflation are primary drivers of premium increases for 2024. The impact of the pandemic is expected to decrease, while the effects of Medicaid disenrollment and other factors vary among insurers.Methods: Proposed rates were collected from RateReview.Healthcare.gov and state rate review websites. Insurer actuarial memoranda were reviewed for key factors contributing to rate changes, including medical trend, COVID-19, Medicaid redeterminations, and other relevant topics.",

Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors.\n\u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview.\nSurgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures.\nBut new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate.\nThe Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\nState bans start to mount again\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions.\nOn July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed.\nOn July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases.\nAny effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said.\u00a0\nAt this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641, o n July 24, according to one tracking site.\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment.\nHolloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs.\n\u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.\nRich Daly\nwas a senior editor in HFMA\u2019s Washington, D.C., Office.\nRelated Tags\nAdvertisements\n\n\t\t\t\tHospital finances are on the upswing, but the toll of the Change Healthcare outage is yet to be seen\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tLeveraging the supply chain for cost reduction\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\tHow healthcare finance organizations are working to become more resilient\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tFTC takes legal action against pharmacy benefit managers, citing a distorted drug-pricing structure\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tReports on healthcare labor trends indicate an improved outlook for hospitals\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedPAC starts to scrutinize the costs of outpatient coinsurance at critical access hospitals \u00a0\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSign up for The Buzz\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHealthcare finance content, event info and membership offers delivered to your inbox.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

By July 20, scheduled surgeries for about 1,500 surgeons reached about the same number that were scheduled in January, before the pandemic, according to data provided to HFMA by surgical scheduling company Surgimate.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear that patients may be skeptical, keep in mind that there was a tremendous April and May backlog to work through,\u201d Rebecca Brygel, CEO of Surgimate, a scheduling company for physician-owned practices, said in a written statement. \u201cEither way, a good portion of patients who require surgical intervention are able to receive the care they need in most areas.\u201d\n\nSurgery cancellation and rescheduling rates fell from 88% in April to pre-COVID-type rates of about 28% in late July. Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\n\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend. Operating room minutes jumped by 92% in May compared with April, although the metric remained 29% lower than in May 2019, according to the latest data from Kaufman Hall, covering more than 800 hospitals.\n\nMore recent data examined by Fitch Ratings showed hospital admissions and surgery volumes returned to 89% of pre-COVID levels in states that opened back up following the first wave, Kevin Holloran, a senior director, said in a July 16 call with investors. \u201cIt was far more rapid than we expected,\u201d Holloran said.\n\nA similar volume recovery in elective surgeries was seen in some ambulatory surgery centers, Bill Prentice, CEO of the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association (ASCA), said in an interview. Surgimate interpreted its data to mean that after restrictions were lifted following the first COVID-19 wave, surgeons\u2019 volumes were not affected by new state requirements for extensive cleaning regimes before and between procedures. But new infection-control measures are still limiting volumes at some ASCs, Prentice said.\n\n\u201cThe difference is procedures are taking longer because of more screening, more intense infection control,\u201d Prentice said. Some facilities have extended operating hours and added days to try to compensate. The Surgimate data includes surgeons from recently hard-hit states, albeit fewer than in other states.\n\nState bans start to mount again\n\nSome southern and western states affected by the latest spike in COVID-19 cases have sought to reimpose elective surgery restrictions. On July 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott banned elective procedures in hospitals in all counties located within 11 designated \u201ctrauma service areas.\u201d Abbott ordered hospitals within those areas to postpone \u201call surgeries and procedures that are not medically necessary to diagnose or correct a serious medical condition of, or to preserve the life of, a patient who without timely performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death, as determined by the patient\u2019s physician,\u201d according to a preceding order on which the new ban was based.\n\nOn July 10, the Mississippi Department of Health issued an order that certain nonurgent surgeries and procedures be postponed. On July 13, the New Mexico Department of Health issued a public health order that reimposed an April 30 public health order prohibiting nonessential healthcare services, procedures and surgeries.\n\nIndustry experts see reason for concern\n\n\u201cLike Texas is starting to pull the throttle back on elective procedures, it feels to me like it is almost inevitable that the other states are going to have to do the same thing,\u201d Holloran said, referring to areas with a resurgence of COVID-19 cases. Any effect on surgery volumes in those states could start to appear within the next few weeks.\n\n\u201cWhile the last 60 days have delivered sound surgical care, it is hard to forecast the future,\u201d Brygel said. At this point, August scheduling looks similar to August 2019, Brygel said, even as the number of daily infections reported nationwide has doubled over the last 30 days. Daily new U.S. infections increased from 32,349 on June 22 to 69,641 on July 24, according to one tracking site.\n\nThe new state restrictions don\u2019t apply to ASCs, according to Prentice. But those facilities have been affected by shortages and increasing costs of personal protective equipment. Holloran said if hospitals\u2019 volumes drop again this year, those organizations will need to look at further cuts to expenses, especially personnel and supply costs. \u201cIf the volume hits become more than temporary, which has been the view up until now, and they become more permanent, you\u2019ll see further revenue reductions, you\u2019ll see further expense reductions, and some of those may turn permanent, versus [employee] furlough,\u201d Holloran said.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Neuraminidase gene sequences are analyzed to detect the presence of well-known amino acid substitutions previously associated with reduced or inhibited activity to any of the three neuraminidase inhibitors. Susceptibility to baloxavir is assessed by identifying an amino acid substitution in the PA gene. Of the influenza specimens tested by the CDPH-VRDL to date this season, none have been found to be resistant to neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors (Table 3). Table 3.

ILI is defined as any illness with fever (\u2265100\u00b0F or 37.8\u00b0C) AND cough and/or sore throat. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. A total of 196 enrolled sentinel providers have reported data for Week 11. The percentage of visits for ILI during Week 11 was 4.0% compared to 4.0% during Week 10 and was below the baseline (Figure 3). Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Figure 3.

The 2023\u20132024 baseline is developed by calculating the mean percentage of patient visits for ILI during non-influenza weeks for the most recent three seasons, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic, and adding two standard deviations. Additional information can be found on the CDC website. 7 of 20 Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities Inpatients at Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities with an admission diagnosis including the keywords \u201cflu,\u201d \u201cinfluenza,\u201d or variants of the keywords are defined as influenza-related admissions. The number of influenza admissions is divided by the total number of hospital admissions occurring in the same time period to estimate the percentage of influenza admissions. Admissions for pregnancy, labor and delivery, birth, and outpatient procedures are excluded from the denominator. Influenza admission data is not comparable to previous seasons reports which included pneumonia and influenza (P&I) admissions. The percentage of admissions for influenza in Kaiser Permanente Northern California facilities during Week 11 was 0.2% compared to 0.4% during Week 10 (Figure 4). Figure 4.

Most influenza admissions occurred among persons \u226565 years (Figure 5). Please note that influenza admissions serve as a proxy for influenza activity, but do not necessarily represent laboratory-confirmed influenza infections. Figure 5. Age Group Distribution of Non-ICU, ICU, and Deaths Associated with Influenza Admissions at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Facilities, 2023\u20132024 Season to Date Influenza Mortality Surveillance from Death Certificates Deaths occurring in California among residents who had influenza noted in any cause of death field on the death certificate (text or coded) are defined as \u201cinfluenza-coded deaths.\u201d The percentage of influenza-coded deaths is calculated by dividing the number of influenza-coded deaths by the total number of all-cause deaths during the same period. Influenza-coded deaths are not necessarily laboratory-confirmed and are an underestimate of all influenza-associated deaths. Please note that during the 2023\u20132024 season, an update to the methods used to identify influenza-coded deaths resulted in some changes to data from previous seasons. During Week 11, 11 influenza-coded deaths were identified. To date during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season, 570 influenza-coded deaths have been identified (Figure 6). The percentage of deaths coded as influenza during Week 11 was 0.0% compared to 0.1% during Week 10 (Figure 7).\n4 24 1 24 104 1 25 166 28 34 520 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Deaths ICU Non-ICU Percentage of Influenza Hospitalizations Severity of Hospitalization <18 years 18-49 years 50-64 years \u226565 years 9 of 20 Figure 6.

The weekly influenza report includes confirmed deaths formally reported to CDPH through March 16, 2024 (Week 11). Methods used to identify pediatric influenza-coded deaths on death certificates differ from those used to identify the influenza-associated pediatric deaths presented below, which require laboratory confirmation of influenza, and might not include the same individuals. One laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated death in a child <18 years of age was reported to CDPH during Week 11. To date, CDPH has received nine reports of laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated deaths among children <18 years of age during the 2023\u20132024 winter respiratory virus season. Influenza-associated Outbreaks Two laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks were reported during Week 11. To date, 100 laboratory-confirmed influenza outbreaks have been reported to CDPH during the 2023\u20132024 season. One previously reported outbreak was removed because it did not meet the outbreak definition. Figure 9.

Syndromic Surveillance Update A total of 14 border region sentinel providers reported data during Week 11. The total number of patients screened by all sentinel sites for ILI during Week 11 was 12,845. Outpatient ILI activity was 0.4% in Week 11 (Figure 10). All influenza syndromic data summarized for the border region represent a subset of CDC influenza sentinel providers in California. Increases in ILI-related outpatient visits might also include people seeking care for other respiratory illness, including COVID-19. Methods for calculating the 2023\u20132024 season baseline can be found on the CDC website. Figure 10. Percentage of Influenza-like Illness Visits among Patients Seen by Sentinel Providers \u2014 California Border Region, 2018\u20132024 Season to Date Virologic Surveillance Update The percentage of influenza detections in border region clinical sentinel laboratories during Week 11 was 5.0% (Figure 11).

Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Elective surgery volume near normal in late July, analysis finds\n\nElective procedures returned to their January volumes by late July, despite a recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases that led to some voluntary and involuntary suspensions of such procedures, according to a national analysis. By July 20, scheduled surgeries for about 1,500 surgeons reached about the same number that were scheduled in January, before the pandemic, according to data provided to HFMA by surgical scheduling company Surgimate.\n\n\u201cWhile we often hear that patients may be skeptical, keep in mind that there was a tremendous April and May backlog to work through,\u201d Rebecca Brygel, CEO of Surgimate, a scheduling company for physician-owned practices, said in a written statement. \u201cEither way, a good portion of patients who require surgical intervention are able to receive the care they need in most areas.\u201d\n\nSurgery cancellation and rescheduling rates fell from 88% in April to pre-COVID-type rates of about 28% in late July. Cancellation rates fell to 46% in May and 35% in June as states lifted bans on elective procedures.\n\nThe data reflected hospitals\u2019 recovery trend.

This At-a-Glance document is based on the association\u2019s 2024 Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics Update: A Report of US and Global Data From the AHA, which is compiled annually by the AHA, the National Institutes of Health, and other collaborators. The years of data cited were the most recent available for each topic at the time the Update was written. American Heart Association Research \u2022 The AHA uses donations to fund research projects. Research applications are carefully weighed and selected by teams of scientists and healthcare professionals who volunteer for the association. \u2022 Ten investigators received Nobel Prizes for research wholly or partially supported by the AHA. \u2022 The AHA is the largest non-profit, non-governmental funder of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular research in the United States. \u2022 The AHA has funded more than $5 billion in research since 1949. Heart Disease, Stroke, and other Cardiovascular Diseases \u2022 Cardiovascular disease (CVD), listed as the underlying cause of death, accounted for 931,578 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 Heart disease and stroke claimed more lives in 2021 in the United States than all forms of cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. \u2022 Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. Between 2019 and 2020, direct and indirect costs of total CVD were $422.3 billion ($254.3 billion in direct costs and $168.0 billion in lost productivity/mortality). \u2022 In 2017 to 2020 in the United States, 59.0% of non-Hispanic Black females and 58.9% of non-Hispanic Black males had some form of CVD. This race category had the highest prevalence of CVD. \u2022 In 2021 in the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of deaths (40.3%) attributable to CVD in the United States, followed by stroke (17.5%), other CVD (17.1%), high blood pressure (13.4%), heart failure (9.1%), diseases of the arteries (2.6%). \u2022 CVD accounted for 12% of total US health expenditures in 2019 to 2020, more than any major diagnostic group. \u2022 CVD accounted for approximately 19.91 million global deaths in 2021. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. Coronary Heart Disease \u2022 CHD caused 375,476 deaths in 2021. \u2022 According to data from 2005 to 2014, the estimated annual incidence of heart attack in the United States was 605,000 new attacks and 200,000 recurrent attacks. Average age at the first heart attack was 65.6 years for males and 72.0 years for females. \u2022 Approximately every 40 seconds, someone in the United States will have a myocardial infarction. \u2022 From 2011 to 2021 in the United States, the annual death rate attributable to CHD declined 15.0% and the actual number of deaths increased 0.05%. \u2022 The estimated direct and indirect cost of heart disease, in 2019 to 2020 (average annual) was $252.2 billion in the United States. This cost includes CHD, heart failure, part of hypertensive disease, cardiac dysrhythmias, rheumatic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary heart disease, and other or ill-defined heart diseases. Stroke \u2022 In 2021, stroke accounted for approximately 1 of every 21 deaths in the United States. \u2022 On average in 2021, someone died of stroke every 3 minutes 14 seconds in the United States. \u2022 Stroke caused 162,890 deaths in the United States in 2021. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US stroke death rate as an underlying cause of death was 41.1 per 100,000, an increase of 8.4% from 2011, and the actual number of stroke deaths increased 26.3% during the same time period. \u2022 In 2021, there were 7.44 million deaths attributable to stroke worldwide (3.71 million deaths from ischemic stroke, 3.38 million deaths from intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.36 million from subarachnoid hemorrhage). o Oceania and Southeast and Central Asia had the highest rates of overall stroke mortality. o Central Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest mortality rates attributable to ischemic stroke. o Intracerebral hemorrhage mortality was highest in Oceania, followed by Southeast Asia and central and eastern sub-Saharan Africa. o Mortality attributable to subarachnoid hemorrhage was highest in Oceania, followed by Andean Latin America, and Southeast and Central Asia. Sudden Cardiac Arrest \u2022 In 2021, underlying cause sudden cardiac arrest mortality in the United States was 20,114. \u2022 According to 2022 US data, the majority of adult Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrests (OHCA) occur at a home or residence (72.1%). Public settings (17.3%) and nursing homes (10.6%) were the second and third most common locations of adult OHCA. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States. Please refer to the complete Statistics Update for references and additional information for reported statistics. \u00a92024 American Heart Association, Inc. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 According to 2022 US data for adult OHCA only, survival to hospital discharge was 9.3% for all EMS-treated non-traumatic OHCA cardiac arrests. Bystander witnessed adult arrests had a 14.0% survival to hospital discharge and 9-1-1 responder witnessed arrests had a 17.0% survival to hospital discharge. Heart Disease, Stroke and CVD Risk Factors The AHA gauges the cardiovascular health of the nation by tracking eight key health factors and behaviors that increase risks for heart disease and stroke. These are called \u201cLife\u2019s Essential 8\u201d and the AHA measures them to track progress toward improving cardiovascular health for all Americans. Life\u2019s Essential 8 are: not-smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Here are some key facts related to these factors: Smoking \u2022 Worldwide, tobacco contributed to an estimated 7.43 million deaths in 2021. \u2022 In the United States, smoking was the leading risk factor for years of life lost to premature mortality and the third leading risk factor for years of life lived with disability or injury in 2019. \u2022 A meta-analysis of 23 prospective and 17 case-control studies of cardiovascular risks associated with secondhand smoke exposure demonstrated 18%, 23%, 23%, and 29% increased risks for total mortality, total CVD, CHD, and stroke, respectively, in those exposed to secondhand smoke. \u2022 According to the 2020 Surgeon General\u2019s report on smoking cessation, >480 000 Americans die as a result of cigarette smoking and >41 000 die of secondhand smoke exposure each year, \u22481 in 5 deaths annually. \u2022 In 2022, 16.5% of US high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco product use. Additionally, 2.0% of US high school students and 1.0% of middle school students smoked cigarettes in the past 30 days. In the past 30 days, 14.1% of US high school students and 3.3% of middle school students used e-cigarettes. \u2022 In 2022, 11.5% of US adults reported cigarette use every day or some days (13.1% of males and 10.1% of females). Physical Inactivity \u2022 In 2020, the overall prevalence of meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans for aerobic activity was 24.2% in US adults. \u2022 Among US high school students in 2019, 44.1% were physically active for 60 minutes or more on at least 5 days of the week. Nutrition \u2022 Using the AHA\u2019s Life\u2019s Essential 8 scoring metric, diet was among the 4 metrics with the lowest scores; the range for diet across demographic groups was 23.8 to 47.7 out of 100. 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Unauthorized use prohibited. \u2022 Among children 2 to 5 years of age, a mean diet score of 61.1 out of 100 was observed. The score for children 12 to 19 years of age was 28.5 out of 100. \u2022 Using 2019 data, an estimated 7.9 million deaths and 188 million disability-adjusted life years were attributable to dietary risks. The leading dietary risk factors were high sodium intake, low whole grain intake, and low legume intake. Overweight/Obesity \u2022 In the United States, the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity among adults from 2017 to 2020 was 41.8% in males and 41.8% in females. \u2022 The age-adjusted prevalence of severe obesity in adults in the United States in 2017 to 2020 was 6.6% in males and 11.7% in females. \u2022 Worldwide, high body mass index was attributed to 3.69 million deaths in 2021, a change of 46.7% compared with 2010. \u2022 According to the Global Burden of Disease 2021 study, age-standardized mortality rates attributable to high body mass index were lowest in high-income Asia Pacific and highest in southern sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa and the Middle East, and Oceania. Cholesterol \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 86.4 million, or 34.7% of US adults had total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020 about 24.7 million, or 10.0% of US adults had total cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 63.1 million, or 25.5% of US adults had high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (130 mg/dL or higher). \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 41.3 million, or 16.9% of US adults had low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (less than 40 mg/dL). \u2022 Globally in 2021 there were 3.72 million deaths attributable to high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a 19.8% change from 2010. Sleep \u2022 Analysis of 2020 data indicates that the proportion of US adults reporting insufficient sleep (<7 hours) was 32.8% (females, 32.2%; males, 33.4%). Prevalence of reporting insufficient sleep was lowest among older adults (>65 years of age) with 27.3% of females and 24.7% of males in this older group reporting <7 hours of sleep per night. \u2022 Based on 2020 data, 43.7% of US adults self-report they wake up feeling well rested on some days or never (46.9% of females; 40.4% of males). \u2022 Based on 2020 data, during the last 30 days, 24.3% of US adults responded that they had trouble falling or staying asleep on most or all days (27.8% female; 20.6% male). 2024 Statistics Update \u2013 At-a-Glance Statistics Unless otherwise noted, all statistics in this document pertain to the United States.

Diabetes \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 29.3 million (10.6%) US adults had diagnosed diabetes. \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, an estimated 9.7 million (3.5%) US adults had undiagnosed diabetes. Additionally, 115.9 million (46.4%) US adults had prediabetes. \u2022 In 2021, 103,294 US deaths were attributed to diabetes. \u2022 In 2021, an estimated 1.70 million deaths were attributed to diabetes globally. This represents an age-standardized mortality rate of 19.93 per 100,000. High Blood Pressure (HBP) \u2022 Using data from 2017 to 2020, 122.4 million (46.7%) US adults had hypertension. \u2022 In 2021, there were 124,508 US deaths primarily attributable to HBP. \u2022 In 2021, the age-adjusted US death rate primarily attributable to HBP was 31.3 per 100,000.

There was a maximum 45.4% reduction in admissions in 2020, associated with a 27.7% reduction in hospital charges, with significant reductions in all examined diagnoses except for birth.\nMeaning\nIn this study, inpatient pediatric admissions in 2020 were reduced across a heterogeneous range of diagnoses during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\nAbstract\nImportance\nIn early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.\nObjective\nTo determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants\nThis cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.\nMain Outcomes and Measures\nNumber of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.\nResults\nOf 5\u2009424\u2009688 inpatient encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2\u2009823\u2009748 [52.1%] boys; 3\u2009171\u2009224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213\u2009571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43\u2009550 [42\u2009110-43\u2009946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 [$5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$6\u2009324\u2009978\u2009456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.\nConclusions and Relevance\nIn this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was reported in the United States in January 2020.1 In response, the United States declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, expanded airport screenings, required quarantines for travelers, and undertook public information efforts.2,3 Case counts and fatalities increased slowly in January and February 2020 before achieving exponential growth in March 2020.4 Individual states began additional mitigation strategies in the spring, including stay-at-home orders, which took effect from early March through June 2020.5,6 These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality.6,7 Additionally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for the use of face coverings on April 3, 2020, although enforcement varied by state.3,8 Although COVID-19 has resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations,1,9,10 early reports indicate that it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the United States11 and worldwide.12,13 A 2020 study from Brazil,14 in which regional differences contributed to peak bronchiolitis between February and August, showed a 78% to 85% reduction in hospitalization in infants younger than 1 year for acute bronchiolitis in 2020 compared with previous years.\nMany pediatric diagnoses warranting inpatient admission exhibit seasonal variation; prior work has characterized winter predominance in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 and Kawasaki syndrome18; autumn predominance in asthma16,19,20; and summer predominance in trauma.21 These fluctuations in disease pattern are likely influenced by population susceptibility and behavior as well as various environmental factors. However, to our knowledge, the seasonal patterns in other pediatric admissions remain unexplored. The present study is a retrospective analysis of the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database22 to determine the seasonal patterns of a variety of common pediatric admission diagnoses and compare data from the previous decade with 2020 admissions. Given the changes in population behavior in 2020,6,7 we hypothesized that pediatric admissions for a variety of diagnoses would be decreased in 2020 compared with prior years, except for admissions for birth.23,24\nMethods\nStudy Design and Participants\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 51 children\u2019s hospitals across the United States participating in PHIS, an online, quality-controlled, anonymized, administrative database maintained by the Children\u2019s Hospital Association.22,25 To ensure that changes in admission rates over time were reflective of changes in caseload, rather than expansion of the database by inclusion of new hospitals, the present study was limited to the 49 hospitals that have been providing data since 2010. Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were no exclusion criteria. Patients were filtered according to their primary admission diagnoses based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) or ICD-10 codes, depending on whether their admission was before or after October 1, 2015. Selected diagnoses were determined according to the percentage of total admissions in PHIS, disease pathophysiology, and seasonal distribution between 2010 and 2019. The full list of included ICD codes for each diagnosis group is included in eTable 1 in the Supplement. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. This study was granted exemption by the University of Pittsburgh institutional review board; because the data were anonymous, informed consent could not be obtained. This manuscript follows the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies.26\nStatistical Analysis\nEncounter-level clinical and administrative data were extracted from PHIS (admission and discharge dates, age, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnostic codes, insurance status, hospital length of stay, intensive care unit length of stay, complex chronic conditions,27 mechanical ventilation, abstracted charges, and cost). Admissions were described with summary statistics. Hospital charges were adjusted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index according to hospital zip code in PHIS.22 Charge-over-time analyses were adjusted for the quarterly gross domestic product, provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and expressed in quarter 1, 2010, dollars.28 Admission dates were grouped into month and year. Admission numbers were transformed into time series, databased on date of admission, and displayed graphically. Seasonality testing was performed with the Webel and Ollech method.29 Seasonal trends in admission rates between 2010 and 2019 were displayed with locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. For visual comparison, the number of admissions in 2020 was displayed against the aforementioned models. For each diagnosis group, ensemble machine-learning forecasting models were created with autoregressive integrated moving average,30 neural network,31 and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms,32 each weighted on time-series cross-validation.33 Time-series data were arranged such that each model was trained on data from January 1, 2010, until June 30, 2019. Model forecasts were tested against actual admission numbers from July 1, 2019, until June 30, 2020. Model predictions were assessed with mean absolute percentage error,33 and the error rates for July 2019 to December 2019 were compared against those for January 2020 to June 2020. To quantify whether social distancing had a statistically significant association with pediatric admission rates, the actual admission rate in 2019 vs 2020 was compared against the ensemble algorithm\u2019s 95% CI.33 We conducted 2 exploratory analyses by repeating the aforementioned steps for patients with any diagnostic code for acute respiratory failure and for in-hospital mortality. All statistical analyses were performed with R Studio version 1.3.1073 and R versions 4.0.2 and 4.0.3 (R Project for Statistical Computing) with the following packages: Metrics, forecastHybrid, thief, forecast, cowplot, lubridate, forcats, stringr, dplyr, purrr, readr, tidyr, tibble, ggplot2, and tidyverse.34 An \u03b1 value of .05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance, and all tests were 2-tailed. The code used to create the manuscript is publicly available.35\nResults\nDemographic Characteristics\nThere were 49 hospitals with admission data in PHIS between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. There were 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters among 3\u2009372\u2009839 patients beginning in 2010, of which 213\u2009571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. As shown in the Table, the cohort had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 5.1 (0.7-13.3) years and included 2\u2009823\u2009748 (52.1%) boys, 3\u2009171\u2009224 (58.5%) White individuals, 994\u2009915 (18.3%) Black individuals, and 1\u2009111\u2009025 (20.5%) Hispanic individuals. A total of 2\u2009977\u2009372 patients (54.9%) had government insurance, and 2\u2009481\u2009647 (45.7%) had a preexisting complex chronic condition. As shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement, the median (IQR) length of stay was 3 (2-5) days. A total of 186\u2009238 admissions (3.4%) had a length of stay of 30 days or more. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2% (5\u2009380\u2009125 encounters). There were 16 selected diagnoses, encompassing 1\u2009446\u2009376 encounters (26.7%). The number of encounters for each selected diagnosis is shown in eTable 2 in the Supplement; birth, bronchiolitis, and trauma were the most common diagnoses.\nTable. \nAbbreviations: CMS, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; ECMO, extracorporeal circulation membrane oxygenation; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; PHIS, Pediatric Health Information Systems.\nSeasonal Patterns in PHIS Admissions\nOverall admissions in PHIS between 2010 and 2019 are shown in Figure 1. There was an increase in the total number of admissions in winter months compared with summer months between 2010 and 2019. There were significantly fewer admissions in July vs January in 2010 to 2019 (median [IQR], 40\u2009726 [40\u2009063-41\u2009839] vs 47\u2009116 [45\u2009472-48\u2009298]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). As shown in eFigure 2 in the Supplement, there was a significantly lower median (IQR) number of intensive care unit admissions and admissions requiring mechanical ventilation in July vs January 2010 to 2019 (7097 [6754-7483] vs 8002 [7222-8501]; P\u2009=\u2009.04 and 4140 [3962-4234] vs 4525 [4213-4776]; P\u2009=\u2009.02, respectively). There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23\u2009798 compared with a median (IQR) of 43\u2009550 (42\u2009110-43\u2009946) in April 2010 to 2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years, with 26\u2009089 in June 2020 compared with a median (IQR) of 40\u2009824 (40\u2009302-41\u2009583) in June 2010 to 2019.\nA, Number of monthly admissions in Pediatric Health Information Systems between January 2010 and June 2020, represented as a bar chart. B, Number of monthly admissions between January 2010 and June 2020 represented as a line chart. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nAdmissions by diagnoses are shown in Figure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement. Several distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Because bronchiolitis coding changed in ICD-10 to include separate diagnostic codes for respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus, the seasonality of individual pathogens is shown in eFigure 4 in the Supplement for 2016 to 2019. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance, associated with the school-year calendar. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance, inversely associated with the school-year calendar in children aged 5 years and older, as shown in eFigure 5 in the Supplement. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. In the case of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, summer predominance was associated with admissions in children older than 1 year, as shown in eFigure 6 in the Supplement. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\nEach panel shows the number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020. Each blue line represents an admission year between 2010 and 2019, with progressively lighter shades of blue representing later years. The black line represents the line of best fit for the data using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing. The gray bar represents the 95% CI of the regression line. The red line shows the number of monthly admissions from January through June 2020.\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020, as shown in Figure 2 (denoted in red). Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected. Changes in seasonal patterns identified with ensemble time-series forecasting models are shown in Figure 3 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement. Overall, models accurately predicted admission rates from July until December 2019 but not from January to June 2020 (mean absolute percentage error range, 3% to 21.2% vs 8.5% to 1111.7%, respectively; P\u2009=\u2009.06). A total of 70 of 72 monthly admission (97.2%) rates between July and December 2019 fell within the 95% CI of the models. The admission rates for atrial septal defect and hypoplastic left heart syndrome were below the 95% CI predicted by the models in August and December 2019, respectively. All other conditions remained within the model 95% CIs between July and December 2019. Admissions for birth remained within the model 95% CI between January and June 2020. Every other condition decreased below the model 95% CI between January and June 2020.\nEach panel shows the estimated number of monthly admissions for a specified diagnosis between January 2010 and June 2020, according to ensemble forecasting models including autoregressive integrated moving average, neural network, and locally estimated scatterplot smoothing algorithms weighted on time-series cross-validation. All models were trained on data from January 2010 through June 2019, and the testing window for each model is shown. The blue line is the model estimate, and the dark and light blue shaded regions are the model 80% and 95% CIs, respectively. The red line is the actual number of admissions for each month. The vertical line represents January 2020. MAPE indicates mean absolute percentage error.\nHospital Charges\nOverall, 5\u2009377\u2009745 of 5\u2009424\u2009688 encounters (99.1%) among 3\u2009356\u2009656 patients had hospital charge data available. The quarterly total hospital charges, adjusted for Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services wage/price index and quarterly gross domestic product, are shown in eFigure 8 in the Supplement. The per-admission charges with the same adjustments are shown in eFigure 9 in the Supplement. The total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6\u2009024\u2009735\u2009078 compared with a median (IQR) of $6\u2009229\u2009556\u2009859 ($5\u2009951\u2009083\u2009755-$6\u2009551\u2009134\u2009282) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4\u2009327\u2009580\u2009511 compared with a median (IQR) of $5\u2009983\u2009142\u2009102 ($5\u2009762\u2009690\u2009022-$5\u2009991\u2009085\u2009056) between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. However, the median (IQR) per-admission charge in 2020 was $24\u2009358 ($12\u2009631-$51\u2009740) compared with a median (IQR) of $20\u2009352 ($10\u2009781-$43\u2009604) in 2010 to 2019 (P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nExploratory Analyses\nDiagnoses including any cause of acute respiratory failure displayed significant winter predominance. In-hospital mortality did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation. Seasonal trends and machine-learning models for respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality are shown in eFigure 10 in the Supplement. There were annual increases in admissions for acute respiratory failure from 2010 through February 2020, with a decline in spring 2020. There were 3517 admissions for acute respiratory failure in December 2019 compared with 2143 admissions in December 2018, and 2894 in January 2020 compared with 2050 in January 2019. Acute respiratory failure decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in April 2020. There were no significant changes in admissions with in-hospital mortality between 2010 and 2019. Admissions with in-hospital mortality decreased below the model 95% CI beginning in March 2020.\nDiscussion\nTo our knowledge, the present study is the first to use a large database to model pediatric admission volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic for various diagnoses compared with prior years. Using this approach, we identified seasonal patterns in a diverse group of pediatric conditions. Before 2020, pediatric admissions overall displayed winter predominance, associated with an increase in infectious respiratory conditions, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Summer-predominant conditions included trauma and admissions for semielective surgical conditions (eg, atrial septal defects, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in children aged >1 year). The present study is in agreement with several prior studies documenting seasonality in bronchiolitis,15,16 pneumonia,16,17 asthma,16,19,20 Kawasaki syndrome,18 and trauma.21 However, we additionally noted novel seasonality for diabetic ketoacidosis and mental health admissions and the absence of seasonality in admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta. The seasonality of diabetic ketoacidosis was associated with children aged 5 years or older and may be reflective of the efforts of the American Diabetes Association to incorporate school personnel in the diabetes medical management plans for these patients.36\nAlthough COVID-19 has resulted in few pediatric admissions and mortalities compared with those for adults,1,9,10 the present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23\u2009798 in April 2020 vs a median of 43\u2009550 in April 2010-2019). Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. There was a premature termination of winter-predominant conditions such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia and a reduction in admissions for asthma in 2020 compared with previous years. In exploratory analyses, this was coupled with a decrease in all acute respiratory failure diagnoses. Given the infectious nature of these conditions and their spread by respiratory droplets,37,38,39 this may have been associated with the effects of social distancing and possibly was even fortunate, given evidence of a potentially severe respiratory virus season in 2019 to 2020, with the highest number of respiratory failure admissions recorded in the past decade. A recent Australian study corroborates our findings, with more than 95% reduction in respiratory syncytial virus and influenza detection in Western Australia through winter 2020.40 Taken together, these studies suggest that rates of infectious pediatric respiratory conditions are potentially modifiable by changes in human behavior. Similarly, pediatric trauma admissions are often sports related,41 and the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to be associated with decreased childhood physical activity; thus, reductions in trauma admissions were anticipated.42 However, reductions in mental health admissions are surprising, given limited literature suggesting that pandemic-related stressors may worsen mental health in both the general population and those with preexisting psychiatric conditions.43,44 This may represent an opportunity for changes in the delivery of mental health care.45\nThe present study cannot delineate which changes in admission rates represent decreases in incidence, hospital avoidance, or unmet care needs. One inpatient survey suggested that greater than one-third of parents delayed seeking medical care for their child because of fears surrounding COVID-19,46 and case series have reported delayed presentations leading to harm.47,48 Similarly, although admissions for repair of atrial septal defects or later-stage repairs of hypoplastic left heart syndrome may safely be deferred for a short period, it is unclear whether reductions in admission rates represent purely elective surgical delays or the possibility of decreased recognition of congenital heart disease because of decreased contact with health care; small case series of increases in sudden death in adults with congenital heart disease without contact with health care institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been reported.49 Taken together, these findings are worrisome, although not definitive, in that unmet health care needs may be accumulating in the pediatric population as a result of decreased health care interactions.\nReduced patient volumes during early 2020 have reportedly contributed to financial instability for many hospitals and health systems.50 The reduction in charges observed in the present study suggests a proportionate decline in operating income. Although children\u2019s hospitals generally maintain better operating margins compared with other nonprofit hospitals, the 45.4% reduction in inpatient admissions at children\u2019s hospitals observed during the first 6 months of 2020 and 27.7% reduction in charges observed in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years has an influence on financial security.50,51 Leaders of children\u2019s hospitals could face unique challenges in the coming months as patient volumes eventually recover and are potentially coupled with the destabilizing financial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCharacterizing alterations in usual patient admission patterns aids in anticipating the potential ramifications of recent national policies and can also help in crafting responses in a variety of areas. The present study highlights the strengths of an ensemble machine-learning approach to model complex time-series data displaying a variety of seasonal relationships. As complexity in medical information has increased, there has been progressive interest in the application of machine learning to facilitate clinical decision-making. Such algorithms have been studied in a diverse array of applications, including sepsis prediction,52 COVID-19 prognosis,53 population health,54 and cyberbullying.55 In the present study, before the COVID-19 pandemic,6,7 ensemble time-series forecasting models accurately predicted 70 of 72 monthly pediatric admission rates (97.2%) between July 2019 and December 2019. Quantification of the seasonality of various admission types in pediatrics has applicability for hospital, intensive care unit, and ventilator capacity planning as well as trainee education. According to the present study, pediatricians and trainees assigned to inpatient wards in the winter will experience higher-than-average case burden and gain greater experience in managing pneumonia and bronchiolitis, whereas those assigned to emergency departments in the summer will achieve greater experience in the management of pediatric trauma. Such knowledge can be harnessed in the development of training curricula that support experience across the spectrum of pediatric illness.\nLimitations\nThis study has important limitations. As with any retrospective database analysis, admission diagnoses are vulnerable to misclassification owing to coding error. Although including greater than 5\u2009000\u2009000 inpatient encounters, this study is limited to 49 hospitals that consistently provided data to PHIS between January 2010 and June 2020 and may not be representative of national pediatric admission trends. Because of data availability, data from some admissions from late June 2020 are not yet available. This may have resulted in undercounting of admissions from June. However, hospitalizations for birth did not decrease below the 95% CIs for the forecasting model. It is also possible that some hospitals have been delayed in reporting admissions to PHIS because of the pandemic, although this is not a known data quality issue. Owing to data availability, only admissions between January and June 2020 were analyzed regarding the effects of social distancing. Further study is warranted as additional data become available.\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. These trends were effectively modeled with ensemble time-series forecasting algorithms. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotes\neFigure 1.

The AHA is the largest non-profit funder of cardiovascular research in the US, having funded over $5 billion in research since 1949. In 2021, CVD was the underlying cause of 931,578 deaths in the US, more than cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease combined. Between 2017 and 2020, 127.9 million US adults (48.6%) had some form of CVD. The direct and indirect costs of CVD in 2019-2020 were $422.3 billion. Coronary heart disease (CHD) was the leading cause of CVD deaths in 2021, accounting for 40.3% of CVD deaths. Stroke accounted for 17.5% of CVD deaths, with 162,890 deaths in 2021. Sudden cardiac arrest caused 20,114 deaths in 2021. The AHA tracks eight key health factors and behaviors, known as Life\u2019s Essential 8, to gauge cardiovascular health: not smoking, physical activity, healthy diet, healthy body weight, sleep health, and control of cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Smoking contributed to 7.43 million deaths worldwide in 2021. In the US, 16.5% of high school students and 4.5% of middle school students reported current tobacco use in 2022. Physical inactivity was prevalent, with only 24.2% of US adults meeting the 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines in 2020. Nutrition scores were low, with children aged 2-5 scoring 61.1 out of 100 and those aged 12-19 scoring 28.5 out of 100. Obesity affected 41.8% of US adults from 2017 to 2020. High cholesterol was prevalent, with 34.7% of US adults having total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or higher. Insufficient sleep was reported by 32.8% of US adults in 2020. Diabetes affected 10.6% of US adults from 2017 to 2020, with 103,294 deaths attributed to diabetes in 2021.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic\nJonathan H. Pelletier, Jaskaran Rakkar, Alicia K. Au, Dana Fuhrman, Robert S. B. Clark, Christopher M. Horvat\nUPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nAccepted for Publication: December 21, 2020. Published: February 12, 2021. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.37227\n\nThis cross-sectional study examines the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with admissions in the prior decade.\n\nIntroduction\nThe first laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in the US in January 2020. In response, the US declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, and implemented various social distancing measures. These efforts were associated with decreased population movement, COVID-19 incidence, and mortality. Although COVID-19 resulted in relatively few pediatric hospitalizations, early reports indicate it may have been associated with reduced pediatric admission rates in the US and worldwide.\n\nMethods\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study of patients from 49 children\u2019s hospitals across the US participating in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database. Patients were eligible if discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020. Outcomes included the number of monthly and annual admissions over time. Statistical analyses were performed using R Studio and R Project for Statistical Computing.\n\nResults\nThere were 5,424,688 encounters among 3,372,839 patients, of which 213,571 encounters (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. The cohort had a median age of 5.1 years and included 52.1% boys, 58.5% White individuals, 18.3% Black individuals, and 20.5% Hispanic individuals. A total of 54.9% had government insurance, and 45.7% had a preexisting complex chronic condition. The median length of stay was 3 days. Overall survival to discharge was 99.2%. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019, with a nadir in April 2020 at 23,798 compared with a median of 43,550 in April 2010-2019. Admissions increased in May and June of 2020 but remained below the level of previous years.\n\nSeasonal Patterns in Selected Diagnoses\nSeveral distinct seasonal patterns were noted. Admissions for bronchiolitis, dehydration, Kawasaki syndrome, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and sepsis exhibited significant winter predominance. Admissions for asthma and mental health disorders showed significant fall and spring predominance. Admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis showed significant summer and winter predominance. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, birth, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tetralogy of Fallot, and trauma showed significant summer predominance. Admissions for cardiac arrest and coarctation of the aorta did not meet criteria for significant seasonal variation.\n\nChanges in Seasonal Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThere were deviations from previous seasonal patterns in 2020. Admissions for bronchiolitis and S pneumoniae reached previous summer rates by April 2020. Admissions for trauma did not exhibit a typical increase in spring 2020. Admissions for appendicitis, atrial septal defects, asthma, coarctation of the aorta, dehydration, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health conditions, sepsis, and tetralogy of Fallot decreased below expected levels. Birth rates were unaffected.\n\nHospital Charges\nThe total hospital charges in quarter 1 of 2020 were $6,024,735,078 compared with a median of $6,229,556,859 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 3.3% decrease. The total hospital charges in quarter 2 of 2020 were $4,327,580,511 compared with a median of $5,983,142,102 between 2010 and 2019, representing a 27.7% decrease. The median per-admission charge in 2020 was $24,358 compared with a median of $20,352 in 2010 to 2019.\n\nDiscussion\nThe present study found reductions in pediatric admission rates for non\u2013COVID-19\u2013related diagnoses in 2020. Admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years. Reductions in admissions below those predicted by ensemble forecasts were present in all of the selected diagnoses except birth. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nConclusions\nIn this study, common pediatric admission diagnoses exhibited seasonal variation. The overall number of pediatric admissions in PHIS decreased between January 2020 and June 2020. This trend held through a wide variety of diagnoses. The reduction in pediatric admissions may be representative of unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Depression is more than just a few days of moderate sadness. It's a severe clinical illness that is remarkably common and affects your overall mental health and state of mind. It may cause you to feel worn out, depressed, nervous, or terrified. It can alter the way you think, eat, and sleep. Some people may commit suicide due to depression. Antidepressants may be suggested by a medical professional for anxiety or sleeplessness in cases of chronic pain.\u00a0\r\nHealthcare professionals occasionally suggest antidepressants for various conditions. Antidepressants come in a variety of forms. Everyone operates in an unforeseen way. Doctors advise starting with the more modern antidepressants since they have fewer negative effects than the older ones. Different antidepressants may be more effective at alleviating different symptoms of depression. The way that antidepressant symptoms vary from person to person and from one medicine to the next.\nMarket Dynamics of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nKey Drivers\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nThe growing awareness of psychological health concerns and the initiatives to lessen the stigma associated with seeking treatment are major factors propelling the market for antidepressant medications. Public knowledge of psychological health concerns, such as anxiety and depression, has grown as a result of developing awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. The number of individuals who identify the signs of mental health disorders and seek professional treatment will rise, which will raise the need for antidepressant drugs. Educating the public about mental health illnesses, accessible treatments, and the need to get assistance is the aim of educational efforts and programs. Media campaigns that feature true tales, celebrity endorsements, and accurate portrayals of psychological health issues contribute to public awareness.\u00a0\nAs society's perceptions of mental health shift, there is a growing understanding of the prevalence and consequences of mental health conditions, such as anxiety and depression. This changing view has led more people to seek care for mental health difficulties, increasing the demand for effective therapy. Moreover, the reduced stigma has encouraged pharmaceutical companies to invest in the development of new, more potent antidepressants. To satisfy the needs of numerous patients, the industry has expanded to provide a greater range of treatment options.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, the data updated by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in January 2022 shows depression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the US, and an estimated 46.9% of adolescents with a major depressive episode and significant impairment received treatment in the previous year.\r\n(Source:https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/mental-illness\u00a0)\nRestraints\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nPatients may be reluctant to begin or continue antidepressant medication due to worries about potential side effects and their general well-being. Reduced market development and poorer solution rates may result from patient resistance and non-compliance. Regulations and warning labels have the potential to negatively affect consumers' perceptions and reduce their belief in the safety of antidepressant drugs, which can hinder the growth of the market. Unfavorable events and health issues may lead to legal actions and lawsuits against medication companies. Legal disputes may be detrimental to a business's profits, the reputation of an antidepressant, and consumer trust.\nHow Did COVID-19 Impact the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nAntidepressant market growth has been positively influenced by the COVID-19 epidemic because of an increase in product sales related to the disaster. Furthermore, the market expansion has been helped by important tactics used by biotechnology and pharmaceutical businesses, such as maintaining a balance between the supply and demand of their goods. Due to several causes, including financial and emotional strain, stress, worry, and dread, the pandemic has increased stress levels in the general population, which has increased the prevalence of depression. This has resulted in a greater proportion of patients receiving therapy, together with the expansion of telehealth and increased public knowledge of available treatment options.\nOpportunities\u00a0of the Antidepressant Drugs Market\nBy improving patient outcomes overall, increasing treatment adherence, and providing more advanced access to psychological wellness care, telemedicine, and digital mental health solutions create opportunities for the antidepressant medication industry. When more people have access to mental health services, more will be able to receive evaluations and prescriptions for antidepressants. Telemedicine platforms provide remote meetings between psychiatrists and other medical experts as well as patients. Prescriptions for antidepressants may now be filled remotely, which is more convenient for patients and may lead to a rise in prescription rates.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, In February 2021, Ginger, a company providing on-demand mental healthcare announced a partnership agreement with Capsule, a digital pharmacy. This partnership was aimed at providing Ginger members with mental health medications including anti-depressants at their homes.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210224005209/en/Ginger-Partners-with-Capsule-to-Seamlessly-Prescribe-and-Deliver-Mental-Health-Medications\u00a0)\nWe have various report editions of Antidepressant Drugs Market, hence please contact our sales team and author directly to obtain/purchase a desired Edition eg, Global Edition, Regional Edition, Country Specific Report Edition, Company Profiles, Forecast Edition, etc. Request for your Free Sample PDF/Online Access.\nCompetitive Landscape: Antidepressant Drugs Market\nMajor market participants who are essential in determining consumer preferences and market dynamics have a major impact on the antidepressant drugs market.

The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors segment dominated the market, with a market share of xx% in 2024. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family of antidepressants is extensively prescribed and used for several reasons. Because of their effectiveness, favorable side effect profile, and safety as compared to other previous classes of antidepressants, SSRIs are well-known and widely used. It is typified by lingering melancholy and disinterest in routine tasks. Since SSRIs and SNRIs are so good at reducing symptoms and enhancing mood stability, they are frequently given for MDD.\nThe above Chart is for representative purposes and does not depict actual sale statistics.

The major depressive disorder segment dominated the market, with a market share of xx% in 2024. Since antidepressant medications effectively reduce the negative symptoms associated with depression, they are frequently used to treat Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The main symptoms of depression, such as chronic resentment, lack of interest or joy, altered sleep patterns, altered appetite, exhaustion, and feelings of worthlessness, can be effectively treated with antidepressants.\u00a0\r\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0For instance, in January 2022, Pacific Neuroscience Institute (PNI), announced the launch of a psilocybin clinical trial for depression. This study aims to analyze the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for the treatment of major depressive disorders.\u00a0\r\n(Source:https://www.pacificneuroscienceinstitute.org/blog/trip/embracing-the-psychedelic-renaissance-pacific-neuroscience-institute-unveils-new-center-of-excellence/\u00a0)\nThe above Graph is for representation purposes only.

The oral segment dominated the market, with a market share of xx% in 2024. The most frequent way that many drugs, including antidepressants, are delivered to the body is by oral administration. Many people are content to take pills or capsules and are aware of oral prescriptions. Antidepressants are fairly well absorbed after oral administration. The oral bioavailability of most antidepressants is reduced by first-pass metabolism in the liver. In general, antidepressants have long elimination half-lives, and inactivation and elimination of most antidepressants occur over a period of several days.\u00a0\n\nThe route of administration segment is divided into oral and injectable.

    "Document2": "New COVID vaccines are here. What to know about latest shots in wake of nation\u2019s biggest summer surge\nOn the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers.\nBack in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early.\nManufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use.\nIn considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.\n\u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants.\n\u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d\nWho can get a new COVID vaccine?\nThe CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children:\nAdults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults.\nPeople with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses.\nI recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine?\nYes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months.\nHowever, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area.\nI just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one?\nFor people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician.\nIf you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated.\nAre the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same?\nBoth use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them.\nComirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nSpikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA.\nAll new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine?\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift.\n\u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d\nTaking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2.\nI got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine?\nYes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter.\nIn the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d\nHopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity.\n\u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19.\n\u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d\nCan you get COVID from the vaccine?\nNo. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains.\n\u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d\nBecause younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body.\nBen-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d\nCan I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time?\nYes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d\nCan I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated?\nYes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death.\nDoes insurance cover the new COVID vaccine?\nThe vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program.\nThe 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients.\n\u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d\nWhere can I get the new COVID vaccine?\nVisit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829.\nDo I still need a COVID vaccination card?\nIf you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card.

    "Summarized_Document2": "On the heels of the nation\u2019s biggest summer COVID surge\u2014test positivity peaked at 17.8% the week ended Aug. 10\u2014help has arrived. The 2024\u201325 coronavirus vaccines, initially anticipated this fall, are now hitting U.S. clinics, hospitals, pharmacies, and other health care providers. Back in June, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended everyone ages 6 months and older get an updated vaccine as soon as they became available \u201clater this year.\u201d Last year\u2019s 2023\u201324 vaccines launched in mid-September, and the public had been expecting the 2024\u201325 version around the same time this year. Citing skyrocketing disease spread, however, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late August announced it had okayed the vaccines early. Manufacturers Pfizer and Moderna said Aug. 22 that their respective immunizations would be widely available in the days immediately following the FDA\u2019s backing. On Aug. 30, the FDA authorized a third COVID vaccine, manufactured by Novavax, for emergency use. In considering vaccination for you and your loved ones, keep in mind the protection you\u2019ll be providing your community, says Dr. Robert Hopkins Jr., medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. \u201cRemember that when you get vaccinated, not only do you give yourself a vaccine that\u2019s going to reduce your risk\u2014short-term for infection, longer-term for severe infection\u2014you\u2019re contributing to a community,\u201d Hopkins tells Fortune. \u201cThe more people who are vaccinated, the less likely we\u2019re going to get sustained circulation of that virus in the community. That means you\u2019re less likely to get continued evolution of variants. \u201cIt also means fewer people, hopefully, ending up in the hospital or potentially passing away from these viruses. So I think about vaccination for personal benefit, for family benefit, and also for community benefit.\u201d Who can get a new COVID vaccine? The CDC recommends a 2024\u201325 vaccine for everyone 6 months and older\u2014regardless of whether you\u2019ve had COVID, received prior versions of the vaccine, or have never gotten a vaccine. This includes people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. However, dosage guidelines differ between adults and children: Adults 65 and older, who may be at higher risk of severe COVID infection, were previously advised to get a second dose of the 2023\u201324 vaccine. For now, the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend a second dose of the 2024\u201325 vaccine for older adults. People with moderately to severely compromised immune systems, though, may soon resume eligibility for additional doses. While the CDC hasn\u2019t yet updated its immunization guidelines for this population, they previously were eligible for additional doses at least two months apart. Ask your doctor if you qualify for extra doses. I recently had COVID. Can I get the new vaccine? Yes, but you may delay vaccination for up to three months after infection, the CDC says. While you\u2019re less likely to become reinfected so soon after having COVID, research has shown natural immunity to level off after several months. However, it\u2019s okay to get vaccinated sooner than later if you or a loved one have a medical condition that puts you or them at high risk of severe infection. You may also consider getting vaccinated earlier if the virus is rapidly circulating in your area. I just got the 2023\u201324 COVID vaccine. When can I get the new one? For people 5 and older, the CDC advises postponing your 2024\u201325 shot until at least eight weeks after your most recent dose of a previous vaccine, including if you were immunized outside the U.S. Children 6 months to 4 years should wait three to eight weeks, depending on their vaccination history; refer to this CDC dosing chart and consult your child\u2019s pediatrician. If you previously received doses of COVID vaccines that aren\u2019t FDA-approved, FDA-authorized, or prequalified or listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, the CDC considers you unvaccinated. Are the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines the same? Both use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, and the CDC doesn\u2019t recommend one vaccine over the other. Still, subtleties exist between them. Comirnaty is the brand name of Pfizer\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 30 \u03bcg of mRNA. Pfizer\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses for children 5 to 11 contain 10 \u03bcg of mRNA, while doses given in a series for children 6 months to 4 years contain 3 \u03bcg of mRNA. Spikevax is the brand name of Moderna\u2019s FDA-approved COVID vaccine for people 12 and older. Each dose contains 50 \u03bcg of mRNA. Moderna\u2019s unnamed version of the vaccine for children 6 months to 11 years has been authorized for emergency use. Single pediatric doses contain 25 \u03bcg of mRNA. All new Pfizer and Moderna vaccines target the Omicron variant KP.2 strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID. What\u2019s different about the Novavax vaccine? While the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are mRNA-based, the Novavax vaccine is protein-based. In short, manufacturing the latter is a more complex process, explains Dr. Michael Ben-Aderet, associate medical director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Despite being newer, the mRNA technology is also relatively swift. \u201cIt uses mRNA, which is a blueprint for a protein, to essentially use your cells to produce the protein that will develop your immunity,\u201d Ben-Aderet tells Fortune. \u201cA protein vaccine is the more traditional way, where you actually give people the protein that you want them to develop immunity to.\u201d Taking longer to make means protein-based vaccines also take longer to get the FDA\u2019s blessing, he says. By Sept. 13, though, Novavax\u2019s updated vaccine for people 12 and older had become available at major pharmacies nationwide. The Novavax formula targets JN.1, the parental lineage of KP.2. I got the shot last year. Do I need the new COVID vaccine? Yes, the CDC recommends staying up to date with your immunizations. Vaccine-induced immunity decreases over time, so you\u2019re likely not as protected against the coronavirus as you were a year ago. In addition, last year\u2019s vaccine was engineered to combat the most prevalent Omicron subvariants circulating at the time, not the ones now surging and projected to spread through the winter. In the future, we may even need two or more booster doses per year, says Dr. Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. But for now, she anticipates the new vaccines will curb the current wave. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that we all get vaccinated prior to cooler weather,\u201d she tells Fortune. \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving indoors, [where] there\u2019s a higher risk of transmission.\u201d Hopkins acknowledges that people may have become apathetic about COVID vaccination more than four years after the virus\u2019s arrival. Yet updated immunization is critical to managing disease spread and severity. \u201cWe had pretty reasonable uptake of the initial round of vaccine. When the bivalent vaccine came out, we saw a drop-off in uptake of that, and a drop-off again in the 2023\u201324 vaccine,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cWhere that\u2019s left us is that we\u2019ve continued to see thousands of hospitalizations every year due to COVID-19. We\u2019ve continued to see thousands of deaths every year due to COVID-19. \u201cThe absolute numbers have come down from the first year of the pandemic, but it\u2019s still having a major impact on our society.\u201d Can you get COVID from the vaccine? No. Any post-immunization malaise you may feel is your immune system kicking into gear, Sampathkumar explains. \u201cIt\u2019s technically impossible for the vaccines to [give you COVID],\u201d she says. \u201cWhat you\u2019re feeling is evidence that the body is responding appropriately\u2026you should welcome that.\u201d Because younger people have more robust immune systems, they may experience a stronger reaction, she says. In addition, the severity of your reaction should decrease over time. For example, you may not have much of a reaction to your annual flu shot if you\u2019ve been getting it your whole life, but you may have felt poorly after your first COVID shot because it was foreign to your body. Ben-Aderet adds that COVID vaccines don\u2019t contain virus particles, let alone live virus: \u201cAll they have in them is a small fragment of mRNA, so there is just no way that that could lead to an infection.\u201d Can I get the COVID and flu shots at the same time? Yes, per the CDC. Sampathkumar adds, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely fine getting multiple vaccines at the same visit. It does not decrease your response to any of the vaccines you get.\u201d Can I still get COVID if I\u2019m vaccinated? Yes. No vaccine is 100% effective\u2014especially given SARS-CoV-2\u2019s penchant for mutation\u2014and getting immunized doesn\u2019t guarantee you won\u2019t get COVID. Rather, the vaccine\u2019s job is to keep you as healthy as possible if you do become infected, helping prevent severe disease, hospitalization, and death. Does insurance cover the new COVID vaccine? The vaccine is free to most U.S. adults through their private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid plans, according to the CDC. Children 18 or younger may be eligible for free immunization through the CDC\u2019s Vaccines for Children Program. The 25 million to 30 million adults nationwide without insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t cover all vaccine costs had been offered free COVID immunization through the federal Bridge Access Program, but the initiative was slated to end on an unspecified date this month. CDC Director Mandy Cohen said in a briefing last week, however, that the agency had earmarked an additional $62 million that would allow state and local immunization programs to purchase vaccines for uninsured and underinsured patients. \u201cI would encourage folks to be reaching out to their local public health departments, their state public health departments,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cTheir federally qualified health centers as well, those are opportunities.\u201d Where can I get the new COVID vaccine? Visit Vaccines.gov to find a location near you. You can also call 800-232-0233 or text your ZIP code to 438829. Do I still need a COVID vaccination card? If you received your initial COVID vaccine doses when they first became widely available in 2021, you may have a CDC-issued paper vaccination card. They were once such a hot commodity that retailers offered deals to customers who brandished them and criminals were caught selling fake ones. The CDC no longer issues these cards, so no need to worry about losing yours or having to bring it to your next vaccination. You may request a paper or digital copy of your vaccine history from your state\u2019s Immunization Information System if you wish.

The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

    "Document2": "Trail Blazers suffer 3rd worst loss in history at Miami Heat\nPatty Mills #88 of the Miami Heat shoots the ball against the Portland Trailblazers during the first half at the Kaseya Center on March 29, 2024 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

    "Document2": "Trail Blazers suffer 3rd worst loss in history at Miami Heat\nPatty Mills #88 of the Miami Heat shoots the ball against the Portland Trailblazers during the first half at the Kaseya Center on March 29, 2024 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Lauren Sopourn/Getty Images)Getty Images\nDeandre Ayton and Matisse Thubulle returned to the rotation for the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night and were greeted rather rudely by the Miami Heat.\nThe Heat led 29-19 after the first quarter then went off for 45 points in the second quarter to lead 74-30 at halftime. The Blazers never remotely got back into the game and fell 142-82, the third most lopsided defeat in franchise history.\n\u201cIt was just a rough one,\u201d Blazers coach Chauncey Billups told reporters. \u201cIt was just a rough one for everybody.\u201d\nNot quite everybody. Ayton, who missed four games with elbow tendinitis, did all he could during a dreadful first half by scoring 16 points on 8-of-13 shooting.\n\u201cWe were happy to have him,\u201d Billups said. \u201cDA was his normal efficient self. He was very efficient and he was good on the glass. I\u2019m pretty sure he felt good just kind of getting back out there after being down for a while. I thought he did the best that he could.\u201d\nThe rest of the Blazers shot 10 of 32 (31.3%) from the field in the first half and 1 of 14 from three-point range while committing 10 turnovers.\nFor the game, the Blazers shot 39.8% from the field and 5 on 31 threes (16.1%). The Blazers committed 24 turnovers on the night.\nBillups briefly discussed how the Blazers started off playing clean basketball. They led 11-10 about four minutes into the game.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t last long,\u201d Billups said. \u201cIt happened pretty quick where we couldn\u2019t score. We couldn\u2019t get in the paint. We try to make a point, always, of getting the ball to the paint. Collapsing defenses and then create the chase, is what I call it.\u201d\nInstead, Miami prevented the Blazers from accomplishing their goal.\n\u201cTheir defense, they got physical,\u201d Billups said. \u201cAnd we couldn\u2019t get to the paint. And we just kind of settled, settled, settled. We turned it over. And we had a lot of what I call \u2018shooting turnovers,\u2019 which are just horrible shots that might as well be a turnover. And everything just kind of went bad at the same time.\u201d\nAyton, who played just over five minutes in the second half, finished with 18 points and eight rebounds. Scoot Henderson led the Blazers with 20 points with six assists but also committed seven turnovers.\nDalano Banton, who set a career high with 31 points during Wednesday\u2019s loss at Atlanta, shot just 5 of 19 against the Heat for 12 points.\nThe Heat did whatever they wanted on offense, shooting 59.3% from the field and 21 of 39 on threes (53.8%).\nThe Heat had six players with double-digit scoring, four over 20. Thomas Bryant led the Heat with 26 points off the bench. Terry Rozier scored 22 with six assists.\nWHAT IT MEANS\nThe Blazers (19-55) lost their ninth consecutive game to match their longest losing streak of the season. The Heat (40-33) remained in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, slightly ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (39-35).\nMONUMENTAL LOSS\nThe 60-point defeat is the third-worst in franchise history. Earlier this season, Portland lost 139-77 at Oklahoma City. That 62-point defeat ranks second all-time. The Blazers\u2019 worst loss in franchise history came Feb. 27, 1998, at Indiana by the score of 124-59 (65 points).\nMATISSE THYBULLE\nThe Blazers guard returned to action but didn\u2019t last long. Thybulle played seven minutes before leaving the game with a right ankle impingement. He had missed five games with an ankle injury leading up to Friday night.\nNEXT UP\nThe Blazers play at 4 p.m. Monday at the Orlando Magic.\nLatest Blazers news\n-- Aaron Fentress | afentress@Oregonian.com | @AaronJFentress (Twitter), @AaronJFentress (Instagram), @AaronFentress (Facebook)\nMORE BLAZERS COVERAGE\nIf you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Last year, the Lakers finished the season 47-35 and made the playoffs. However, they lost to the Denver Nuggets in the First Round in 5 games. Will they fare better this year? Let's find out.\nLos Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will go 48-34 in the regular season and make the playoffs. But before we show what happened in the postseason, let's see how they got there in the first place.\nOctober \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers' 2024-2025 season started on a rough note, with the team going 1-4 in October. The team performed well offensively, but the same couldn't be said about the defense. They managed to start the year 1-0 after beating Minnesota 111-103. But they instantly faced a fierce five-game losing streak that set them back.\nLeBron James and Anthony Davis led the team in minutes per game, points scored, and several other statistical categories. But as we can see, there'll need to be improvements from other players if they want to turn things around.\nNovember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe month of November was a bit better for the Lakers, but the team still struggled. As we mentioned, they suffered a loss to start the month, extending their losing streak to five. However, the Lakers went on to win seven of their next nine games to go 8-7. However, as soon as things were looking better, they lost four straight to end the month and end up being below .500 again.\nNothing was too different here than in October. While the team played well offensively, they allowed over 1,500 points (110 points per game) in a 14 game stretch. However, the season is still early and anything is possible.\nDecember \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nBecause some games are still to be decided, a couple of games here do not reflect the actual 2024-2025 season. Instead of waiting for December to see the confirmed matchups, we just rocked with what NBA 2K25's MyNBA mode provided for us. The rest of the season does accurately reflect the real 2024-2024 schedule.\nAnyways, it was a better month for the Lakers who finally evened out their record. Additionally, the defense managed to buckle down and play better, though they still need to improve. However, thanks LeBron averaging over 27 points per game, the Lakers' offense is in good hands. We also got to see Bronny James play for the first time, though he only played for two minutes against the Kings near the end of the month.\nJanuary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers started off their New Year with a win to go above .500 for the first time this season. They went on to win two more games to extend their win streak to four games. Furthermore, this month saw the team win some important matchups, including a 1 point victory over the Celtics.\nIn fact, L.A. had three close games this month in which the winning team only won by 1 point. Another thing worth noting is the defensive improvement. This month they only allowed over 100 points in half of their matchups this month. It's not perfect, but the Lakers seemed to find a better rhythm in terms of defense.\nOverall, Davis and LeBron continue to be the superstars of this team. Fortunately, they've both been healthy and didn't get injured\u2026 yet.\nFebruary \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nThe Lakers continued another win streak in the month of February, winning their first three games before losing to the Pacers. Overall, they went 16-11 in the first two months of the year as they continue to build their record. At this point into the season, it seems unlikely the Lakers will be able to catch up to the Mavericks, who are the #1 team in the league.\nThe Lakers still find themselves fighting for a playoff spot, but the slight improvements every month seem to help the team inch towards a postseason spot.\nA quick shoutout to Austin Reaves here, who put up 29 points in the team's 127-94 win over the Denver Nuggets. With Nikola Jokic missing the game due to injury the Lakers took advantage and got a little revenge on Denver.\nMarch \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nMarch started off ugly as the team suffered a 77-97 loss to the Clippers. However, they went on to win 12 games this month as they essentially clinched a playoff spot. They also faced a lot of adversity, as D'Angelo Russell missed time due to injury. Although not the star player of the team, it hurts to lose good depth guys.\nNevertheless, L.A. performed fine without him, as LeBron James continued to ball out. We also got to see Bronny play, but just barely. He made one basket and earned an assist in the team's 113-102 win over the Grizzlies. But the most important thing here for L.A. to do is win a few more games to reserve a playoff spot.\nApril \u2013 Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2024 Season Results According to NBA 2K25\nDespite an ugly three-game losing streak in the middle of the month, the Lakers did just enough to earn the fifth seed in the NBA Playoffs. They started the month with back-to-back wins, and ended the month with another two to edge out Sacramento for the 5 seed.\nLike last year, it wasn't the most prettiest season, but L.A. found a way to make the postseason and avoid the Play-In. However, they now host a San Antonio Spurs team which shocked the league this season. Can they defeat San Antonio, whose now led by second-year superstar Victor Wembanyama?\nNBA Playoffs First Round \u2013 vs. #4 San Antonio Spurs\nThe Lakers got off to a hot start in this series, but ultimately let the Spurs take a quick 2-1 lead in the series. However, LeBron buckled down, averaging a whopping 33 points per game to help the Lakers overcome the Spurs. However, there was one major problem the Lakers now had to deal with.\nAnthony Davis suffered an ankle injury which would cause him to miss at least the next round. Can the Lakers hold off the #1 Mavericks without him?\nNBA Playoffs QuarterFinals \u2013 vs. #1 Dallas Mavericks\nAccording to NBA 2K25, the Los Angeles Lakers will lose to the Dallas Mavericks in the Quarterfinals of the NBA Playoffs. Due to Anthony Davis' injury, the team suffered a serious collapse, failing to score and rebound throughout the contest. LeBron also faltered, now averaging just 23 points per game in the series.\nAlthough they made it farther than they did last season, the Lakers were still hoping to reach the NBA Finals again. As long as LeBron is still playing at an All-Star level, the team can definitely make a big push this year. Unfortunately, NBA 2K25 doesn't think they'll go that far.\nOverall, that wraps up the Los Angeles Lakers 2024-2025 Season Results according to NBA 2K25. We hope you enjoyed reading. We also look forward to another exciting NBA Season, which begins in October.\nFor more gaming and NBA news, visit ClutchPoints.

Where does everyone else land?\nShare this story\n\nShare\nAll sharing options for:\nReport card: grading each member of the Celtics through 55 games\n\nThe All-Star break is an ideal time to take a step back, catch our collective breath and analyze what we\u2019ve seen to this point.\nIt\u2019s also a fun time to dish out some grades. The Celtics are 43-12, so naturally most of these grades are going to be favorable, but the minuses and pluses are sure to spark some debate. Here we go:\nJayson Tatum: A\nTatum is the best player on the best team. Forget the Most Valuable Player talk for a second. He probably won\u2019t win it, and that\u2019s OK; he\u2019s the head of the snake and has reached a new level as a leader this year with Marcus Smart gone. \nHe\u2019s taking even more accountability defensively, minimizing poor shooting nights and complaining about calls a little less (I said a little). If he\u2019s not careful, he might become the face of the league in June.\nJayson Tatum is confident he's the NBA's top player   pic.twitter.com/UBL5SyCaZu\nJaylen Brown: B+\nBrown has had some moments of brilliance and some head-scratchers along the way. He\u2019s capable of dropping 30-plus any night, but he\u2019s also capable of dropping 10 or fewer. The most important thing for him (now that he appears to possess a left hand) is consistency. \nHe\u2019s shooting a career-high 49.2 percent from the floor, but just 34.2 percent from 3-point range. His defense and passing have improved, but he\u2019s averaging his fewest rebounds (5.5) since 2018-19. When Brown is elite, the Celtics are essentially unbeatable.\nKristaps Porzingis: A\nIt\u2019s hard to remember a situation since Kevin Garnett where a player adjusted so seamlessly and immediately felt like the missing piece. Porzingis has been insanely efficient on post-ups, excelling in an area the Celtics dramatically needed him to.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively and is more capable of guarding shorter players than I realized. The only small critiques are that he should shoot a smidgen more 2s and a smidgen fewer 3s. I mean, the guy\u2019s 7\u20192 with the touch of an angel.\nMost points per possession on post-ups this season (min. 75 FGA): 1.42 - Kristaps Porzingis 1.17 - Joel Embiid 1.17 - Myles Turner 1.16 - Jayson Tatum1.15 - Jonas Valanciunas 1.14 - Nikola Jokic 1.12 - Anthony Davis 1.11 - Karl-Anthony TownsKP in a league of his own   pic.twitter.com/I58XI7K17E\nJrue Holiday: A-\nHoliday\u2019s 3-point shooting has exceeded expectations (career-high 44 percent), and he sets the tone defensively every night. He always finds clever ways to contribute, whether he takes 20 shots or five. \nHis maturity, consistency and poise set him apart. One area I\u2019d like to see a bit more is playmaking. He\u2019s averaging 4.8 assists \u2013 his lowest since 2011-12 \u2013 and I believe that number could be around 6. Obviously part of it is circumstantial, but I think putting the ball in his hands at the top of the key a bit more could be beneficial.\nDerrick White: A\nDon\u2019t worry, White gets an A. I\u2019m sure my colleagues would blast me if he didn\u2019t, but he truthfully does deserve one. He has career-highs in points (15.6), rebounds (3.9), blocks (1.2) and steals (1) and consistently plays his best in the fourth quarter.\nWhite is the consummate professional and has become a fan favorite. He can do no wrong in Celtics\u2019 fans eyes. Folks appreciate guys who hustle, make winning plays and exude charisma, and White embodies all those characteristics and then some.\nAl Horford: B+\nHorford is always ready, whether the Celtics need him to play 30 minutes or 15. At the moment, he gets a B+, but this grade is less relevant than some others. It\u2019s all about preserving him for the playoffs, and he\u2019s fully capable of upping his grade to an A then \u2013 particularly if Boston plays Philly.\nOne area Horford has really excelled this year is rebounding (6.7 a night). His 3-point shooting has naturally dipped a bit from last year, but it\u2019s still at 40.9 percent. I still want to see him attack the basket a bit more, but it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just not in his wheelhouse at this point.\nPayton Pritchard: A-\nThe Celtics were right to pay Pritchard, and overall, he\u2019s thrived in his expanded role. He\u2019s 15th in the league in assist-to-turnover ratio (4.81) and has excelled as a ball-handler and facilitator. \nHe\u2019s always locked in, whether he plays in the fourth quarter of a close game or garbage time (don\u2019t tell him it\u2019s garbage time). Pritchard fits in perfectly with this core.\nPayton Pritchard stats at the All-Star break:20.7 MPG8.1 PPG3.2 RPG2.8 APG44% FG38% 3FGHow are we feeling about the season so far @paytonpritch3?? pic.twitter.com/BC3DTIIaJo\nSam Hauser: A-\nHauser\u2019s shooting 41.2 percent from 3, which is great, but it\u2019s really his spacing that sets him apart. When Tatum, Brown and Porzingis have the ball, you really can\u2019t double. If you do, they\u2019ll find Hauser open for 3. He\u2019s solid with the bench unit, but he\u2019s even more lethal with the starters.\nHe\u2019s also been a pleasant surprise defensively, and his mid-range jumper\u2019s improved as well. It\u2019s easy to forget this is just his second season logging regular minutes.\nLuke Kornet: B+\nKornet\u2019s averages of 4.9 points and 4 rebounds aren\u2019t earth-shattering, but they\u2019re pretty solid when you consider that he plays 14.9 minutes per game. He\u2019s sneaky good in the pick-and-roll, an absolute goofball and excellent for team vibes. Rim protection is an area where he could improve.\nOshae Brissett: B\nIf Brissett can get that 3-point percentage up just a tick, from 29.3 to 33.3 or so, that would go a long way. He\u2019s long, athletic and has a good motor, but his shot makes him a bit of a liability at the moment.\nNeemias Queta: B+\nQueta is the definition of a \u201cfun project.\u201d You can sometimes see the lightbulb go off mid-game, which is pretty cool, and he\u2019s only getting better. The next steps are post moves, lateral quickness and defending without fouling.\n\n    More From\n    \n        CelticsBlog\n\n\n\n\n\n          Most Read\n        \n\n\n\nSign up for the\n          \n            newsletter\n          \n          Sign up for the Celtics Blog Daily Roundup newsletter!\n        \nCheck your inbox for a welcome email.\nOops.

The attached tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures. All earnings per share figures refer to diluted EPS.\n1Adjusted EPS, a non-GAAP financial measure, excludes the impact of certain discretely managed items. See the tables of this release for additional information about the items that have been excluded from Adjusted EPS.\n\"Our first quarter financial performance was in line with our expectations on both the top and bottom line, tracking the trajectory we outlined for this year and setting up a return to growth in the second quarter,\" said Brian Cornell, chair and chief executive of Target Corporation. \"Our topline performance improved for the third consecutive quarter, with growth in our digital business led by strength in our same-day fulfillment services. Consumers continue to respond to the newness and value that we offer across our shopping experience, and we're pleased with early results from the relaunch of Target Circle. Looking ahead, our team will deliver for our guests through lower prices, a seasonally relevant assortment, ease and convenience, as we keep investing in our strategy and efficiency initiatives to get back to growth and deliver on our longer-term financial goals.\"\nGuidance\nFor the second quarter, the Company expects a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $1.95 to $2.35.\nFor the full year, the Company continues to expect a 0 to 2 percent increase in its comparable sales, and GAAP and Adjusted EPS of $8.60 to $9.60.\nOperating Results\nComparable sales declined 3.7 percent in the first quarter, reflecting a comparable store sales decline of 4.8 percent partially offset by a comparable digital sales increase of 1.4 percent. Total revenue of $24.5 billion was 3.1 percent lower than last year, reflecting a total sales decline of 3.2 percent and a 3.9 percent increase in other revenue. First quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was 2.4 percent lower than last year, driven by lower sales volume.\nFirst\u00a0quarter operating income margin rate was 5.3 percent in 2024, compared with 5.2 percent in 2023. First quarter gross margin rate was 27.7 percent, compared with 26.3 percent in 2023, reflecting the net impact of merchandising activities, including cost improvements that more than offset higher promotional markdown rates, combined with favorable category mix and lower book to physical inventory adjustments as compared to the prior year.\u00a0 First quarter SG&A expense rate was 21.1 percent in 2024, compared with 19.8 percent in 2023, reflecting the combined impact of lower sales and higher costs, including continued investments in pay and benefits and marketing, partially offset by disciplined cost management.\nInterest Expense and Taxes\nThe Company's first quarter 2024 net interest expense was $106 million, compared with $147 million last year, primarily driven by an increase in interest income reflecting higher cash balances year-over-year.\nFirst\u00a0quarter 2024 effective income tax rate was 22.7 percent, compared with the prior year rate of 21.1 percent, reflecting lower discrete benefits as compared to the prior year.\nCapital Deployment and Return on Invested Capital\nThe Company paid dividends of $508 million in the first quarter, compared with $497 million last year, reflecting a 1.9 percent increase in the dividend per share.\nThe Company did not repurchase any stock in the first quarter.\u00a0 As of the end of the quarter, the Company had approximately $9.7 billion of remaining capacity under the repurchase program approved by Target's Board of Directors in August 2021.\nFor the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2024, after-tax return on invested capital (ROIC) was 15.4 percent, compared with 11.4 percent for the trailing twelve months through first quarter 2023. The increase in ROIC reflects higher operating income, partially offset by higher average invested capital. The tables in this release provide additional information about the Company's ROIC calculation.\nWebcast Details\nTarget will webcast its first quarter earnings conference call at 7:00 a.m. CT today.

    "Document1": "Amazon sales come up short, profits nearly double\nby Todd Bishop on August 1, 2024 at 1:21 pmAugust 1, 2024 at 5:30 pm\nIn-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant\u2019s hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.\nAmazon\u2019s sales fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates but profits exceeded expectations in the company\u2019s second quarter results, released Thursday afternoon for the three months ended June 30, 2024.\nThe tech giant reported a 10% increase in second-quarter revenue, to $147.98 billion, shy of expectations of $148.56 billion. Profits were $13.5 billion, or $1.26 per share, nearly double Amazon\u2019s profits in the same quarter a year ago, and surpassing expectations of $1.03 per share.\nSpeaking with reporters on a conference call, Brian Olsavsky, Amazon\u2019s chief financial officer, said average selling prices (ASP) are declining amid cautious consumer spending. Unit sales growth was strong, he said, and an increase in shipping speeds is prompting growth in purchasing of everyday essentials. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is really around ASP, and lower ASP in products selected by customers,\u201d Olsavsky said. \u201cThey are continuing to be cautious with their spending, trading down to lower ASP products. And even on the higher-ticket items \u2026 there\u2019s certainly a drop-off from probably more of a steady-state, thriving economy.\u201d\nAmazon is reportedly planning to launch a new storefront with lower-priced items and slower shipping, directly from Chinese suppliers, to compete with emerging rivals including Temu and Shein. Olsavsky declined to comment directly on those reports in response to a question on the media call.\nIn addition, Olsavsky said Amazon experienced a $1 billion headwind from foreign exchange rates, which was about $300 million higher than the company expected.\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence, Amazon is spending significant sums to expand its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure. Amazon\u2019s capital expenditures and equipment finance leases amounted to $30.5 billion for the first half of the year, and the number is expected to grow in the second half of the year, Olsavsky said.\n\u201cThe majority of the spend will be to support the growing need for AWS infrastructure, as we continue to see strong demand in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads,\u201d he said.\nHighlights from the company\u2019s business segments:\nIn its guidance for the current quarter, which began July 1, Amazon said it expects net sales between $154 billion and $158.5 billion, which translates into a midpoint of $156.25 billion, below the average estimate of $158.24 billion.\nOlsavsky said the current quarter was proving especially challenging to predict, due in part to consumers becoming distracted by news events, elections, and the Olympics, among other factors.\nShares fell 4% in initial after-hours trading. \nGeekWire Newsletters\nSubscribe to GeekWire's free newsletters to catch every headline\nSend Us a Tip\nHave a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

At the same time, not enough stock causes slow order fulfillment, the potential for missed sales, and lost revenue.\nReorder point (ROP) is a supply chain management technique that businesses can use to guide this delicate balancing act to improve inventory operations, avoid stockouts, and maintain ideal inventory levels.\nWhat is the reorder point?\nThe reorder point is the minimum number of units a company needs to have in stock to fill sales orders or meet production targets. Once inventory dips below the calculated reorder point, replenishment is triggered through a new purchase order.\nRegularly calculating reorder points removes the mystery from inventory cost control and helps your business maintain optimal service levels.\nWhy should your business know your reorder points?\nReorder points help to ensure products and cash flow in the right direction, at the right time. With accurate reorder points for all of your product SKUs, you can meet customer demand in a timely fashion to improve cash flow and avoid the bloated costs of overstock.\nPrimary business benefits of using reorder points include the following:\nCost control\nInventory\u00a0carrying costs\u00a0typically account for 15-30% of total inventory costs. This affects the profit margin on goods sold. By using the most optimal reorder levels, businesses can keep storage and warehousing costs low to protect profits. \nOptimal inventory levels\nBy reordering a predetermined amount of replenishment inventory according to demand forecasts, you can avoid sunk costs from inventory shrinkage and obsolescence.\nSupply chain optimization\n The reorder point calculation takes into account delivery lead time from suppliers. By keeping track of average delivery lead time, you can identify your most reliable and least reliable suppliers and make more informed\u00a0procurement decisions.\nImproved forecasting\nTo accurately calculate reorder points, you\u2019ll need to have strong records on sales volume and trends over a certain time period. As you build this body of data, you can improve forecasting to better meet customer demand.\nNow, let\u2019s see how to find the reorder point.\nHow does the reorder point formula work?\nThe reorder point formula takes into account three factors: average daily sales or usage, average delivery lead time, and safety stock.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nFirst, let\u2019s define all of the components that make up this equation.\nComponents of the reorder equation\nAverage daily sales or usage\n Average daily sales is the average number of units sold or used per day over a defined time period. Three months or 90 days is a good starting increment to use. A retailer would measure the average number of units sold, while a manufacturer would calculate the average number of components used per day. \nLet\u2019s say you sold 40 units of an item in March, 60 in April, and 46 in May.\nOver those three months (or 92 days) that averages out to 1.5 units sold on average per day.\nAverage delivery lead time\n Average delivery lead time is the average amount of time it takes for a shipment to arrive from the time the order was placed. Average delivery lead time changes with fluctuations in seasonal demand, the quantity ordered, and distance from the up-chain supplier. For a reasonable measure, take an average of the past three months of POs for the SKU item you want to set a reorder point for. If your sales cycle is longer or shorter, adjust accordingly. \nSafety stock\nSafety stock\u00a0is the amount of inventory a business holds to mitigate the risk of shortages or stockouts. The safety stock calculation is the difference between the maximum daily sales/usage and lead time, and the average daily usage and lead time. \n(Max. Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time)\n Let\u2019s say a manufacturer used 10 units of a component on their busiest day of production. The longest time it would take the supplier to deliver this component is 15 days. And let\u2019s assume that the average daily use is 1.5 units, and the average lead time is 12 days. \n(10 x 15) \u2013 (1.5 x 12)\n150 \u2013 18 = 132\u00a0\nThe manufacturer should hold 132 safety stock units to avoid bottlenecks in production.\nThe reorder point formula in action\nNow we\u2019ve got all reorder point sub-metrics ready. Let\u2019s continue with the manufacturer example and calculate the reorder point.\nReorder Point = (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock\nAverage daily usage = 1.5 units\nAverage lead team = 12 days\nSafety stock = 132 units\n(1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150\nTherefore, the manufacturer should reorder this component when stock falls to 150 units. By doing so, the company can prevent stockouts and avoid dipping into safety stock while they wait for new stock to arrive.\nHow to start using the reorder point formula in your business\nIf you have at least one procurement cycle and one sales cycle worth of data, you can start using the reorder point formula to improve your inventory operations.\nBusinesses with a limited number of products can start with excel spreadsheets and format cells to turn red when inventory levels reach the reorder point.\nFor growing\u00a0retailers,\u00a0manufacturers, or\u00a0wholesalers, working with dozens or hundreds of spreadsheets can be time-consuming and error-prone. If your business falls into this category, consider the benefits of\u00a0inventory management software.\n A modern inventory management system can bring greater efficiency to inventory processes through automation and digital tools. For example, real-time inventory tracking allows staff to see what\u2019s in stock, what\u2019s on order, and where each item is located. Software tools can also collect and present data on purchase orders, sales fulfillment, and demand forecasting on a single user dashboard. \n With this information readily available, inventory managers can avoid wasting time manually searching through spreadsheets and crunching numbers. Some inventory management tools also enable businesses to generate customized reports on inventory stock by item, vendor, delivery date, assembly, and more. Rich inventory insights like these empower businesses to fine-tune their reorder points and overall inventory management processes. \nFinal thoughts\nKeep in mind, reorder points are not static. Sales volumes fluctuate, and supply delivery times vary. Demand for certain product lines may grow or fall.\nTo maintain an accurate reorder point, check the underlying metrics \u2014 average daily sales/usage and average lead time \u2014 at least once per quarter. If you have a high season and low season, or seasonal bad weather that slows down deliveries, factor this in.\nAn effective reorder point ensures that your business keeps flowing\u2014 it helps you fulfill orders quickly, protects your margins, and keeps customers happy.\nRecommended for you\nMidsize business\nWhat is the safety stock formula?

Daily Usage x Maximum Lead Time) \u2013 (Average Daily Usage x Average Lead Time).For example, if a manufacturer uses 1.5 units daily on average, with an average lead time of 12 days and a safety stock of 132 units, the reorder point would be (1.5 x 12) + 132 = 150 units.

Small businesses might use spreadsheets, while larger operations may benefit from inventory management software for greater efficiency and accuracy.

Small businesses that use FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges jump to $1.60 in Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 period, as well as through the Dec. 11 to Jan. 14 time frame, an increase from $1.50 in the comparable periods last year. The surcharges will escalate to $2.60 in the more hectic periods of the season, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, up from $2.50 in the comparable period last year.\n\n\tThe demand surcharges also apply to packages that are large, oversized or require additional handling via U.S. Ground and U.S. Express.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe \u201cadditional handling\u201d surcharges were increased to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, while oversize charges jumped from $68.75 to $73. Ground unauthorized package charges\u2014fees for packages that are so big that FedEx Ground has the discretion to refuse, return to the shipper or dispose of them\u2014are now $410, up from $385 in the year prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nFedEx is also implementing surcharges that target larger shippers\u2019 volume spikes during the holidays to mitigate strain on its network. Starting Oct. 30, enterprise-level customers shipping more than 20,000 residential and FedEx Ground Economy packages will be subject to the company\u2019s \u201cresidential delivery charge.\u201d\n\n\tThis charge can range from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package, and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. The amount depends on how much more the customer is shipping compared to their weekly average residential and FedEx Ground Economy volume from June 5 to July 2. FedEx calls that increase a shipper\u2019s \u201cpeaking factor.\u201d\n\n\tFedEx will calculate the peaking factor each week from Oct. 9-15 to Dec. 18-24, with a week\u2019s charge being applied three weeks later. This means that a customer that ships 20 percent more volume the week starting Nov. 6 than they did from June 5 to July 2 will see an added $1.35 charge for each applicable FedEx Ground package shipped the week starting Nov. 27.\n\n\tTommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at Insight Sourcing Group, said FedEx and UPS have both gotten increasingly creative in their residential delivery surcharges as they have expanded their networks.\n\n\t\u201cOutside metro areas, costs get more expensive because the density of delivery is not as prevalent,\u201d Storch previously told Sourcing Journal. \u201cFedEx and UPS are very good at always creating new charges\u2026It\u2019s so complex, and they only make it more complex every single year. It\u2019s really something that if a shipper is not managing on a monthly basis, you can all of a sudden have your costs explode on you.\u201d\n\n\tAs of Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates 5.9 percent on average across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase an undisclosed amount.\n\n\tThe average annual rate increases are one percentage point lower than last year\u2019s general rate increase (GRI) of 6.9 percent. But the higher rates came when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5 percent, well above the July 2023 inflation number of 3.2 percent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to FedEx, the price adjustments reflect incremental costs associated with the current operating environment, while also accounting for the investments the company has made in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations \u201cand other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\tUPS has yet to unveil its 2024 GRI, but it has traditionally hiked rates directly in line with FedEx, which raised its rates 6.9 percent for 2023. Both companies raised GRI 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.9 percent each year from 2012-2021.\n\n\tThe only reason this year could be different is based on speculation that UPS could decide to pass on the higher costs to customers after 340,000 unionized employees secured a new contract worth \u201c$30 billion in new money\u201d over five years.\n\n\tFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent dependent on the customer\u2019s transportation rate scale. This change applies to shipments within the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\n\tDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7, the package delivery company says.\n\n\tAlso effective Jan. 1, FedEx will be increasing customs clearance service fees on imports.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

    "Document2": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalmart supply chain and logistics chief talks about challenges, lessons learned\nby Kim Souza\u00a0([email\u00a0protected])  December 1, 2021 6:59 pm 7,266 views\u00a0\nTim Cooper, senior vice president of supply chain and grocery and reverse logistics at Walmart, spoke Wednesday (Dec. 1) about lessons learned in the past 20 months since the COVID-19 pandemic gripped the nation.\nHe made his comments at the WalStreet Speaker Series, a virtual event presented by the Greater Bentonville Area Chamber of Commerce.\nCooper said Walmart has learned a lot about the supply chain since the spring of 2020 and now operates differently in reaction to the pandemic. Cooper said Walmart has an end-to-end grocery supply chain that includes an upstream grocery network of 13 import, storage and consolidation centers and a grocery distribution network that has 47 grocery distribution centers (DCs).\nHe said there is inbound freight from suppliers that go into the Walmart distribution centers and then Walmart trucks send that outbound freight to Walmart\u2019s stores and clubs \u2013 and now to customer homes in some cases. Cooper also oversees a reverse network of reusable pallets, recalls and defective products.\nHe said the upstream business consists of consolidation volume from smaller suppliers which is about 80% of the intakes. He said fresh and repack volumes amount to about 14% of the freight and imports are 6% of the volume. Upstream volume has grown from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. He said returns and mailbacks are up with more groceries being purchased online in the past two years. Defective and recalled items have decreased 20% from 2019.\nAll the extra freight meant Walmart delivered 104 million more pallets. If all the pallets were lined up end to end they would circle the earth 6.5 times, Cooper said.\nHe said it was daunting to see empty shelves in Walmart stores nationwide in March 2020 and subsequent months. Cooper said Walmart has done a better job this year keeping shelves stocked despite a period of record buying. He said winter storms in Texas rendered 16 DCs closed for several days and that was unprecedented for the center of the country where Walmart has a huge store presence.\n\u201cWe also pulled through 5 tropical storms and hurricanes late last year and one grocery DC in Louisiana is still struggling to get back online,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in 2020, Walmart\u2019s supply chain division saw a massive decline in workforce numbers despite hiring events, added incentives and wage increases.\n\u201cFor four straight months last year, we had more exits than hires which equated to net negatives in just about all of our facilities. It was a dire situation for several months, but another round of wage increases and two national hiring events helped the DCs get staffed back up,\u201d Cooper added.\nCooper said Walmart added 2,600 net hires so far in 2021 bringing the grocery supply workforce up to 36,400. He said the employees work in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. Walmart grocery is on track in 2021 to ship 4.99 billion cases, up from 4.39 billion in 2018 and 4.64 billion in 2019. Last year, Walmart shipped 4.87 billion cases which equals the output of an additional DC in two years. Cooper said the retailer only added one DC, an indication that each DC was running more efficiently. The highest week of output in 2020 was 106.8 million cases that occurred in March of that year as the country began to shut down.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think that record would ever be broken, but the week before Thanksgiving this year it was topped with 108.5 million cases shipped to stores,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThe difference was that in 2020 we were scrambling, running with smaller crews, somewhat exhausted. This year our changes in operations, more automation and better staffing we could have shipped more, except the store operators told us they had nowhere to put more product. This is a great place to be when you run a supply chain,\u201d Cooper said.\nAlso in the busiest week of 2021, Cooper said Walmart made 117,000 discreet truck deliveries to U.S. stores with a 98.7% on-time performance.\u00a0Cooper said Walmart will continue to add automation to its legacy fulfillment and distribution centers. He said micro-fulfillment centers are also a way Walmart is getting consumable inventory closer to the consumers.\nHe said the automation going into DCs and fulfillment operations remove some redundant tasks. He said average warehouse workers would walk an average of 10 miles a day, stooping and bending for 10 hours and lifting a total of roughly 50,000 pounds throughout their shifts.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s hard to keep people in these roles. But automating those tasks we can use the employee in more important ways running these machines and adding more efficiency to the operations. An automated facility can do almost double the output of a traditional legacy facility,\u201d Cooper said.\nHe said the path to the consumer is also becoming more complex. Cooper said there is a wider assortment of products than ever before and there are some distinct logistics requirements depending on the item. He said grocery and cold chain foods will most likely continue to be purchased in stores and via online grocery pickup and delivery via last-mile partners.\nBut shelf-stable foods have more possibilities with direct shipping to homes from the fulfillment centers, automated replenishment, store delivery for in-store shoppers, curbside pickups and final-mile deliveries with various partners like DoorDash and Walmart\u2019s Spark drivers. Cooper said the supply chain for grocery continues to evolve as the message from consumers is clear.\n\u201cThey want what they want when they want it and where they want it and it\u2019s up to Walmart to respond to their demands. We have learned so much in the past 18 months and we continue to invest for the future with automation, building a strong workforce and continue to manage the costs of our end-to-end supply chain which is best-in-class,\u201d Cooper said.\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon took part this week with the Biden administration\u2019s meeting on supply chain. McMillon said Walmart is seeing a 51% increase in throughput at the congested San Pedro Bay ports in the past month after shifting to 24/7 shipping. Walmart has moved cargo 26% faster nationally \u201cin terms of getting containers through ports\u201d over the last four weeks, McMillon said.\n\u201cWe have more inventory than we did a year ago and have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business. And we are seeing progress. The port and transit delays are improving,\u201d McMillon said.\nRelated\nRead the Digital Issue\nSubscribe Now\nFollow NWABJ on Facebook\nSearch Talk Business & Politics\n Talk Business & Politics by email\nArkansas headlines delivered to you on demand\nFollow TBP Everywhere\n\n\n\nTalk Business & Politics is a news website that covers business, politics and culture in Arkansas.

    "Summarized_Document1": "FedEx is increasing surcharges for the 2023 peak season and has announced its general rate increase (GRI) for 2024. The company aims to boost profitability and cut $4 billion in costs by the end of its 2025 financial year. The surcharges, now called 'demand' surcharges, will apply during any period of elevated demand, not just the holiday season. Key surcharge changes include: \n\n- Small businesses using FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges rise to $1.60 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 and Dec. 11 to Jan. 14, up from $1.50 last year. During the peak period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, surcharges will increase to $2.60 from $2.50. \n- 'Additional handling' surcharges will increase to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, and oversize charges will rise from $68.75 to $73. \n- Ground unauthorized package charges will jump to $410 from $385. \n\nFedEx is also targeting larger shippers' volume spikes during the holidays with a 'residential delivery charge' ranging from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. This charge depends on the customer's shipping volume compared to their weekly average from June 5 to July 2. \n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates by an average of 5.9% across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Home Delivery services.

Walmart's end-to-end grocery supply chain includes 13 import, storage, and consolidation centers and 47 grocery distribution centers (DCs). The company has seen significant changes in its operations since 2020, including an increase in upstream volume from 228 million pallets in 2019 to 235 million in 2020. Despite challenges like winter storms and workforce shortages, Walmart managed to keep shelves stocked and improve efficiency. In 2021, Walmart added 2,600 net hires, bringing the grocery supply workforce to 36,400 employees working in 36.3 million square feet of DC space. The company shipped 4.99 billion cases in 2021, up from 4.87 billion in 2020. Automation has played a key role in increasing efficiency, with automated facilities nearly doubling the output of traditional ones. Walmart's supply chain continues to evolve to meet consumer demands, with a focus on automation, workforce development, and cost management. CEO Doug McMillon noted improvements in port and transit delays, with a 51% increase in throughput at the San Pedro Bay ports and a 26% faster national cargo movement over the last four weeks.",

Small businesses that use FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges jump to $1.60 in Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 period, as well as through the Dec. 11 to Jan. 14 time frame, an increase from $1.50 in the comparable periods last year. The surcharges will escalate to $2.60 in the more hectic periods of the season, from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, up from $2.50 in the comparable period last year.\n\n\tThe demand surcharges also apply to packages that are large, oversized or require additional handling via U.S. Ground and U.S. Express.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tThe \u201cadditional handling\u201d surcharges were increased to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, while oversize charges jumped from $68.75 to $73. Ground unauthorized package charges\u2014fees for packages that are so big that FedEx Ground has the discretion to refuse, return to the shipper or dispose of them\u2014are now $410, up from $385 in the year prior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tTopics\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025 Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmazon Hikes Hourly Warehouse, Delivery Minimum Wage to $22\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\nFedEx is also implementing surcharges that target larger shippers\u2019 volume spikes during the holidays to mitigate strain on its network. Starting Oct. 30, enterprise-level customers shipping more than 20,000 residential and FedEx Ground Economy packages will be subject to the company\u2019s \u201cresidential delivery charge.\u201d\n\n\tThis charge can range from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package, and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. The amount depends on how much more the customer is shipping compared to their weekly average residential and FedEx Ground Economy volume from June 5 to July 2. FedEx calls that increase a shipper\u2019s \u201cpeaking factor.\u201d\n\n\tFedEx will calculate the peaking factor each week from Oct. 9-15 to Dec. 18-24, with a week\u2019s charge being applied three weeks later. This means that a customer that ships 20 percent more volume the week starting Nov. 6 than they did from June 5 to July 2 will see an added $1.35 charge for each applicable FedEx Ground package shipped the week starting Nov. 27.\n\n\tTommy Storch, a transportation procurement expert at Insight Sourcing Group, said FedEx and UPS have both gotten increasingly creative in their residential delivery surcharges as they have expanded their networks.\n\n\t\u201cOutside metro areas, costs get more expensive because the density of delivery is not as prevalent,\u201d Storch previously told Sourcing Journal. \u201cFedEx and UPS are very good at always creating new charges\u2026It\u2019s so complex, and they only make it more complex every single year. It\u2019s really something that if a shipper is not managing on a monthly basis, you can all of a sudden have your costs explode on you.\u201d\n\n\tAs of Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates 5.9 percent on average across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase an undisclosed amount.\n\n\tThe average annual rate increases are one percentage point lower than last year\u2019s general rate increase (GRI) of 6.9 percent. But the higher rates came when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 6.5 percent, well above the July 2023 inflation number of 3.2 percent.\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\tAccording to FedEx, the price adjustments reflect incremental costs associated with the current operating environment, while also accounting for the investments the company has made in service enhancement, fleet maintenance, technology innovations \u201cand other areas to serve customers more effectively and efficiently.\u201d\n\n\tUPS has yet to unveil its 2024 GRI, but it has traditionally hiked rates directly in line with FedEx, which raised its rates 6.9 percent for 2023. Both companies raised GRI 5.9 percent in 2022, and 4.9 percent each year from 2012-2021.\n\n\tThe only reason this year could be different is based on speculation that UPS could decide to pass on the higher costs to customers after 340,000 unionized employees secured a new contract worth \u201c$30 billion in new money\u201d over five years.\n\n\tFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by an average of 5.9 percent to 6.9 percent dependent on the customer\u2019s transportation rate scale. This change applies to shipments within the U.S. (including Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada.\n\n\tDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7, the package delivery company says.\n\n\tAlso effective Jan. 1, FedEx will be increasing customs clearance service fees on imports.\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Newsletters\n\t\n\t\nReceive Our Daily Newsletter & Special Offers\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSJ Recommends\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAAFA Calls on Biden to Intervene in East Coast Port\u00a0Talks\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChain Reaction: John Singleton of Wen-Parker Logistics on Navigating Post-Pandemic Supply Chain\u00a0Disruptions\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018A Very Difficult Moment\u2019 for Retail: How Could A Change to De Minimis Impact Shippers\u2019\u00a0Costs?\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFedEx Posts Disappointing Q1 Results; Revises Fiscal 2025\u00a0Outlook\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSJ Newsletters\t\t\n\t\n\nGet the news straight to your inbox\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVideos\n\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs Your Cotton Safe?

This website is not intended for users located within the European Economic Area.\nUSPS addresses delay \u2018hotspots\u2019 amid network modernization, but faces year-end challenges\nPostal experts say USPS improvements to on-time delivery are needed, and must continue, for Congress to allow these plans to keep moving forward.\nThe Postal Service is addressing mail delays in parts of the country where it launched the first wave of its network modernization plans.\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy told members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in April that USPS would correct a decline in on-time deliveries in areas where the agency opened the first of its regional mail processing mega-centers, called Regional Processing and Distribution Centers (RPDCs).\nThese large facilities serve as hubs for long-distance transportation, where USPS employees sort mail and packages coming from and going to other regions.\n\u201cIn regards to service deteriorating, we recognize that, and we apologize to the constituents that have received that service,\u201d DeJoy told the committee on April 16. \u201cBut in the long term, if we don\u2019t make these changes, that will be every day, everywhere around the nation.\u201d\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Join us on Oct. 1 and 2 for Federal News Network's Cyber Leader Exchange where we'll dive into how agencies are strengthening federal cyber capabilities.\nLawmakers in regions hardest hit by regional delays \u2014 such as Atlanta\u00a0and\u00a0Richmond, Virginia\u00a0\u2014 say on-time performance is improving.\nSen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), one of the most vocal critics of recent USPS delays,\u00a0 met with DeJoy last month to discuss the agency\u2019s improved performance in his state. In a press release following the meeting, Ossoff said that \u201cwhile data has shown improvement, there is still more needed.\u201d\n\u201cFor months I have sustained relentless pressure on USPS management to fully resolve disastrous performance failures impacting my constituents in Georgia. I\u2019m still hearing from Georgia families and businesses about the difficulty they continue to face sending and receiving their mail,\u201d Ossoff said in a statement.\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), who also met with DeJoy last month, said service in his state is improving after USPS opened a large regional mail processing plant in Richmond.\n\u201cWhile we are glad to see some gains in the on-time delivery rate in Virginia, there\u2019s much more work to do. We will continue to press for increased transparency, greater engagement with the public, and a higher standard of service for communities across Virginia,\u201d Warner said in a statement last month.\nUSPS spokesman Dave Walton told Federal News Network that the agency is \u201cdedicated to maintaining the positive advancements observed in the Richmond and Atlanta areas.\u201d\nFor the week ending Aug. 2, USPS delivered about 95% of first-class mail within six days.\nThe agency considers first-class mail delivered on time within five days, but also tracks its \u201cplus-one day\u201d performance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Read more: Agency Oversight \nIn Virginia, USPS also delivered more than 95% of first-class mail within six days.\n\u201cWe continue to enhance employee availability, provide comprehensive training for management, address operational and maintenance challenges, and have implemented new transportation schedules,\u201d Walton said.\n\u2018Back to normal\u2019\nEdmund Carley, national president of United Postmasters and Managers of America (UPMA), said Richmond is \u201cback to normal,\u201d after dealing with some issues, such as challenges with employee availability.\n\u201cEverybody was mad, it was chaos. We didn\u2019t know when the trucks were running. We didn\u2019t implement the change. It\u2019s better than it was a year ago, with a much more efficient process. But it takes a while for it to work out,\u201d Carley said.\nUSPS is shaking up its nationwide delivery network to save money in the long term. Carley said the status quo is unsustainable for USPS, which is more than a third of the way through a 10-year plan to regain its financial footing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while for the savings and efficiencies to come back after the implementation,\u201d he added. \u201cBut you can\u2019t compare it to perfect. You can\u2019t compare the Richmond plants and its performance today to perfect. You\u2019ve got to compare it to what it was before the change. And as long as it\u2019s better, and we\u2019re using a lot less hours, it\u2019s a success. I don\u2019t think anybody steps back and allows us the room to do that.\u201d\nPostal experts say USPS improvements to on-time delivery are needed, and must continue, for Congress to allow these plans to keep moving forward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Want to stay up to date with the latest federal news and information from all your devices? Download the revamped Federal News Network app\n\u2018Steady decline over three years\u2019\nWhile USPS is addressing regional hotspots with the most severe delays, its data shows mail delivery is slowing year-over-year at a national level.\nDave Lewis, president of the postal metrics company SnailWorks, said USPS delivered about 93.6% of first-class mail on time in 2022 \u2014 but that so far in fiscal 2024, the agency is delivering about 81% of first-class mail on time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a steady decline over three years. And those aren\u2019t fluky numbers. You see it week after week. So they have deteriorated, and it is a general deterioration,\u201d Lewis said in a recent interview.\nSource: SnailWorks. 2024 data is for the year so far.\nAccording to SnailWorks data, a first-class letter took 2.96 days to get delivered on average, in 2022.\u00a0So far in 2024, USPS is taking about 3.76 days to deliver that same letter.\n\u201cYou go, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a day. That\u2019s not that big a deal.\u2019 But these are averages. [On] the bad end, anecdotally, I just hear a lot of really nightmare stories. It\u2019s just things taking weeks to deliver. The bulk of it goes kind of slower, that\u2019s not that big a deal. But at the fringes, I think it\u2019s worse than it looks there.\u201d\nThroughout the year, those outliers included Atlanta, Houston and Richmond, Virginia. Lewis said USPS service is improving in \u201chotspots\u201d that saw the worst declines in on-time delivery.\nIn the Atlanta metro area, USPS took about 10-12 days to deliver a first-class letter at the worst point of its regional delays\u2014 \u201cway beyond the norm,\u201d Lewis said.\n\u201cIt has normalized now. Now it\u2019s down to about four days, which is kind of average. It falls in the middle of the pack,\u201d he said.\nLewis said USPS is also stabilizing service in Houston, another previous hotspot of service problems. The regional plant dealt with equipment changes, as well as a recent major storm that knocked out power for the region for about two or three days.\n\u201cIt just fell apart,\u201d Lewis said about the launch of a new RPDC in Houston. \u201cA lot of mailers were complaining that they couldn\u2019t even get their trucks into the facilities. They were just jammed up. They\u2019re relatively back to normal.\u201d\nUSPS is improving on-time delivery in these hotspots. However, Lewis attributed part of the Postal Service\u2019s improved service delivery to a relatively low volume of mail during the summer.\nThe agency, however, will see its workload grow in the leadup to Election Day in November and the agency\u2019s peak season at the end of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s slow right now, it\u2019s summertime, there\u2019s not much mail volume. This service is kind of consistent,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBut I do worry that, because they are planning on rolling out more of these network updates in the coming months, and the volume is going to be much, much heavier. At the end of August, it will be flooded with political mail. And I am concerned that there\u2019s going to be places where mail just may get stuck and may not move.\u201d\n\u201cFor the second half of 2024, I think we will see serious declines. I think there will be some serious issues, because I think the volume of mail will be very heavy,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Something\u2019s going wrong\u2019\nThomas Day, vice chairman of the Postal Regulatory Commission, said USPS is addressing regional delays, but performance still isn\u2019t back to where it was before the agency made its network modernization changes.\n\u201cThey can\u2019t seem to get it back. They can\u2019t even match prior performance,\u201d Day said. \u201cSomething\u2019s going wrong, and I don\u2019t know what the something is. I find it very, very confusing.\u201d\nFor the week of Aug. 3, USPS delivered about nearly 87% of mail in Georgia on time \u2014 and got 95% of mail to its destination a day past its maximum five-day window of being on time.\n\u201cIf the scores had dropped from 90% down to in the mid-80s, and then after a month or two, you bring it back up to 90%, close to 95%, that\u2019s a reasonable disruption. We\u2019re seeing much broader declines,\u201d Day said. \u201cAnd the other thing that\u2019s troubling to me is that this is prolonged. This is not a couple of weeks of adjustment, getting the staff up to speed on how to do it. This is month after month of performance that is just unacceptable.\u201d\nDay, a former USPS executive with 35 years of experience, oversaw the opening of major facilities during his tenure. He said the opening of Atlanta\u2019s Regional Processing and Distribution Center was the \u201cworst implementation of a new postal facility I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d\nRather than take a gradual approach, Day said USPS \u201cflipped the switch\u201d on Feb. 24 and \u201cmoved everything at once.\u201d\n\u201cI have never heard of something like that being done. That\u2019s not the way things are done. You don\u2019t just flip the switch and everything starts up. You do gradual build-ups to make sure things are working. And once you\u2019ve got stability, bring in some more. You want to take advantage of the new facility, but you\u2019ve got to take several weeks, a month or more, to gradually build it up,\u201d Day said.\n\u201cIn Atlanta, because of the way they did it, they have spent so much more money on trying to clean up the mess, than anything they would have lost in savings opportunity, by just doing a gradual opening over weeks or even a couple of months,\u201d he added. \u201cThis isn\u2019t even postal operations. This is a lack of understanding of basic operational concepts.\u201d\n\u2018It just continues to decline year over year\u2019\nWhile USPS remains in the early stages of its network modernization plans, Lewis said the strategy so far has yet to meet its goals of lowering operations costs and reliable services.\n\u201cThe optimist says that, \u2018Well, that just takes time to get these changes adapted, and then they\u2019ll start to improve.\u2019 The evidence I\u2019ve seen so far is that it just continues to decline year over year. If had to bet the house, I would say I don\u2019t see any reason why they won\u2019t continue declining next year. I\u2019m hopeful l see otherwise, but that\u2019s certainly been the pattern so far,\u201d Lewis said.\nDay said scrutiny of USPS performance in Atlanta isn\u2019t just about the on-time metrics.\nUnlike other parts of the country, where USPS is retrofitting existing facilities and turning them into RPDCs, the large mail processing hub it opened in Atlanta was brand-new construction and a model of what USPS management envisioned from its new facilities.\n\u201cThere was a building that was constructed exactly to what they wanted and equipped with exactly what they wanted inside it with all the transport people, you name it. It was to be the crowning glory of what RPDC was to be all about. It was terrible,\u201d Day said.\nDay said the best USPS scores in the country are in the parts of the network that are still operating under the old system for mail processing.\n\u201cUnfortunately, that has not worked, at least from a service standpoint \u2014 although I should say I\u2019m not seeing a financial standpoint either,\u201d he said.\nCarley said DeJoy\u2019s network modernization plans are looking to achieve what USPS sought under another reform plan that began more than a decade ago \u2014 and was halted by Congress.\n\u201cSome of the stuff he\u2019s doing now with those plants is what should have been done 10 years ago,\u201d Carley said. \u201cThe idea is that you have 300-some-odd plants across the country, when you could have 60 larger facilities and 150 small facilities. In essence, it logically makes sense, and it\u2019s where we would have been, if we hadn\u2019t had the political pressure in 2014.\u201d\nCarley said that some parts of the latest USPS reforms haven\u2019t gone according to plan, but DeJoy has made adjustments when\u00a0implementation falls short of expectations.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for the plan being flexible. You have a game plan, and you realize you miscalculated something, we\u2019re going to modify the plan,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m grateful for is the idea that, \u2018OK, we screwed that up. Let\u2019s stop and think what went wrong,'\u201d he added. \u201cYears before, we would\u2019ve just plowed ahead \u2014 \u2018We don\u2019t care, we\u2019re going to keep doing it. Round peg, square hole, we\u2019re going to keep doing it.\u2019\u201d\nBy all accounts, some elements of these reforms are paying off. USPS is saving about $1 billion annually by moving more mail and packages on trucks, rather than paying contractors to fly them across the country.\n\u201cHe made a critical decision, and he saved a lot of money by doing it,\u201d Day said. \u201c[It\u2019s] consistency of service, and you save money.\u201d\nHowever, Day said USPS can \u2014 and should \u2014 improve service while also cutting costs.\n\u201cWhen you do the right steps to achieve consistent, reliable service performance, what you\u2019re going to do is follow a process in an orderly manner, which also is cost-efficient. So when you provide top-quality service, you\u2019re also going to provide the lowest possible cost, because the efficiencies come together,\u201d Day said. \u201cThere\u2019s this mistaken belief that if we let mail go slower, we save money. No, you don\u2019t. That is absolutely false.\u201d\nNetwork modernization continues\nAside from a summertime drop in mail volume, USPS was able to address regional delays because it\u2019s putting some of its network modernization changes on hold until at least January 2025,\u00a0at the urging of lawmakers\nHowever, USPS is still moving ahead with some projects that are already in the works.\n\u201cAt first, the industry was overjoyed to hear that. It looked like they were stopping, but they really aren\u2019t,\u201d Lewis said.\nUSPS plans to launch 15 new Sorting and Delivery Centers (S&DCs) across the U.S. on Sept. 7.\u00a0 S&DCs are smaller versions of Regional Processing and Distribution Centers.\nThe agency will open these new hubs in Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Louisiana, Florida and Pennsylvania.\n\u201cThe Postal Service has targeted key markets where it is beneficial to aggregate delivery units into fewer, larger, centrally located S&DCs \u2014 leveraging both repurposed and new facilities \u2014 to simplify the entire network and create a more reliable and efficient Postal Service,\u201d USPS wrote in an industry notice obtained by Federal News Network.\nCarley said the pause of some network modernization is about \u201cperfecting the implementation.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not slowing down. Nothing has slowed down here. The planning is still ongoing. I think they\u2019ll hopefully have a better handle on the implementation, come 2025. I don\u2019t think, by the end of 2025, they\u2019re going to have any fewer facilities implemented than they would have done without the pause,\u201d he said.\nWhile USPS has seen service degrade in some spots where it\u2019s rolled out its network modernization plans, Carley said USPS is also shaking up its network in places where there aren\u2019t\u00a0complaints about on-time delivery.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put 53 of these S&DCs together. Atlanta\u2019s the only one you hear about,\u201d he said. \u201cAre the other 52 perfect? Probably not, but they\u2019re at least not getting in the newspaper.\u201d\nMarketing mail holds steady\nWhile first-class mail service deteriorated in areas where USPS first rolled out its network modernization plans, performance for marketing mail remains consistent.\n\u201cThat service has not deteriorated in three years. It\u2019s exactly the same. In fact, it\u2019s gotten a little bit better for flat-size mail,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis suspects marketing mail performance is holding steady, because USPS discounts prices for marketers who drop off their mail to a facility that\u2019s closer to the area in which it will be delivered.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last mile, and they\u2019re really good at that. And that has not gotten worse. It\u2019s the getting it to the last mile seems to be where they\u2019re really struggling.\u201d\nIn other words, first-class mail is moving slower when coming in and out of a state or metropolitan area.\n\u201cThat transportation element, that\u2019s really the heart of what they\u2019re trying to change with this network. And the transportation piece just doesn\u2019t seem to be working. That\u2019s where the first-class mail is. The marketing mail, knock on wood, is doing very well for that same time period,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis said flagging USPS service may drive away customers, particularly as the agency keeps raising prices. USPS raised the price of a first-class stamp from 68 to 73 cents in July.\n\u201cThe prices just go up and up and up, and then the prices drive more mail out of the system,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBanks are going crazy trying to get people to go paperless, way more than they have in the past. They really don\u2019t want people using the mail for that.\u201d\nElection mail challenges\nLewis said USPS is well positioned to handle mail-in ballots ahead of Election Day. It\u2019s everything else broadly categorized as \u201celection mail\u201d that may put a strain on the agency.\nLewis said his company tracked more than a billion pieces of election mail USPS delivered in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\u201cThat means, the \u2018Vote for me\u2019\u2019 stuff the candidates mail, and that will be billions and billions of pieces mailed in the next three months,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThere are billions of pieces of that, and that\u2019s what\u2019s clogs the system up. That may get in the way of some of the ballots. That concerns me.\u201d\nUSPS relies on tried-and-true \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to expedite the delivery of ballots to election officials They include extra deliveries and collections, arranging special pickups, expanding hours at processing facilities and bypassing some standard mail processing procedures to fast-track ballots to election officials.\nLewis said the agency can automatically sort out and fast-track the delivery of ballots because of an intelligent mail barcode that goes on every piece of commercial mail.\n\u201cThat indicates that it\u2019s ballot mail. So the machines can automatically identify ballot mail as it goes through. And the point of that is so the Postal Service, as the election nears, they can identify where that mail is and pull it out and make sure it gets delivered on time, and they\u2019ve done a very good job of that in the past,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be terrible,\u201d Lewis added about the agency\u2019s performance ahead of Election Day. \u201cI think ballots will be well delivered. The Post Service understands the importance, and they have something in place to identify that and give it the special handling that it needs.\nDay said recent USPS performance in Atlanta raises legitimate concerns about whether state election officials will receive mail-in ballots in time to be counted. \u201c\nAt the very least, a great deal of caution has to be shown about how mail-in ballots are going to be handled in the Atlanta area. Just to be very, very safe and make sure everything gets counted,\u201d he said.\nSome states count mail-in ballots after Election Day, as long as the ballot is postmarked before the election. However, Georgia has stricter rules and will accept ballots no later than Election Day.\nDay advised Georgia voters voting by mail to drop off their ballot about 10 days in advance of Election Day, \u201cjust to be safe.\u201d\n\u201cGeorgia is a swing state, not the place you want to have problems with mail-in balance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s going to have to be a real concern about how people are advised in the state of Georgia.\u201d\nCopyright\n                            \u00a9\u00a02024 Federal News Network.

    "Summarized_Document1": "FedEx is increasing surcharges for the 2023 peak season and has announced its general rate increase (GRI) for 2024. The company aims to boost profitability and cut $4 billion in costs by the end of its 2025 financial year. The surcharges, now called 'demand' surcharges, will apply during any period of elevated demand, not just the holiday season. Key surcharge changes include: \n\n- Small businesses using FedEx Ground Economy will see surcharges rise to $1.60 from Oct. 30 to Nov. 26 and Dec. 11 to Jan. 14, up from $1.50 last year. During the peak period from Nov. 27 to Dec. 10, surcharges will increase to $2.60 from $2.50. \n- 'Additional handling' surcharges will increase to $6.95 from $6.55 per package, and oversize charges will rise from $68.75 to $73. \n- Ground unauthorized package charges will jump to $410 from $385. \n\nFedEx is also targeting larger shippers' volume spikes during the holidays with a 'residential delivery charge' ranging from $1.35 to $6.35 per FedEx Ground package and $2.40 to $7.40 per FedEx Express package. This charge depends on the customer's shipping volume compared to their weekly average from June 5 to July 2. \n\nStarting Jan. 1, 2024, FedEx will raise shipping rates by an average of 5.9% across its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Home Delivery services. FedEx Ground Economy shipping rates will also increase by an undisclosed amount. This rate increase is one percentage point lower than last year's 6.9% GRI. \n\nFedEx Freight shipping rates will increase by 5.9% to 6.9%, depending on the customer's transportation rate scale. This applies to shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. \n\nDetails of all changes to rates, surcharges, and fees will be available on Sept. 7. Additionally, FedEx will increase customs clearance service fees on imports starting Jan. 1, 2024.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The USPS is addressing mail delays in regions where it launched its network modernization plans, including the opening of Regional Processing and Distribution Centers (RPDCs). Postmaster General Louis DeJoy acknowledged service deterioration but emphasized the necessity of these changes for long-term improvements. Lawmakers from affected areas like Atlanta and Richmond, Virginia, noted some improvements but stressed the need for continued efforts. For the week ending Aug. 2, USPS delivered about 95% of first-class mail within six days, with similar performance in Virginia. However, national on-time delivery rates have declined from 93.6% in 2022 to about 81% in fiscal 2024. The average delivery time for a first-class letter increased from 2.96 days in 2022 to 3.76 days in 2024. Regional hotspots like Atlanta and Houston have seen improvements, but concerns remain about the USPS's ability to handle increased mail volumes during peak seasons, including the lead-up to Election Day. The USPS is also launching 15 new Sorting and Delivery Centers (S&DCs) in various states. Despite some successes, the overall performance has not met the goals of lowering costs and improving reliability. The USPS is saving about $1 billion annually by moving more mail via trucks instead of air transport. Marketing mail performance has remained consistent, but first-class mail service has deteriorated. The USPS is preparing for the upcoming election mail surge, with measures in place to expedite ballot delivery. However, concerns persist about the timely delivery of mail-in ballots, especially in swing states like Georgia.",

    "Document1": "Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever in 2023\u2014and is working to get even faster in 2024\nOne thing we\u2019ve learned about customers over the years is the importance they place on delivery speed. The faster we can get products to customers, the more likely they are to buy them.\nTo that end, we reached an important delivery speed milestone in 2023: Amazon delivered to Prime members at the fastest speeds ever globally, with more than 7 billion units arriving the same or next day, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe.\nThis is a massive accomplishment, and I want to thank the Amazon employees and partners who continue to rethink and reinvent how we get packages to customers.\nFastest speeds ever in 2023\nWe achieved our fastest-ever global shipping speeds last year by focusing on a few key initiatives\u2014shortening the distance our deliveries had to travel to reach customers, improving our inventory placement, and building out our Same-Day Delivery service.\nIn the U.S., for example, we regionalized our operations and transportation networks across the country, dividing them into smaller, easier-to-serve regions. That allowed us to better leverage the in-region inventory for customers and ship nearly 600 million more items from in-region fulfillment centers year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023. Shipping from in-region fulfillment centers to our delivery stations also helped reduce the stops per package and decrease our reliance on air transportation. In Europe, we shortened the average distance each package traveled within our middle mile network by 25 kilometers in 2023 compared to 2022.\nWe focused on inventory placement around the world and worked to stock more of the products our customers want locally, and we expanded our capacity to place these products in the right fulfillment centers in each respective region. This allows us to maintain the broadest selection of products available and enhances our ability to fulfill a customer\u2019s entire order at one time from the Amazon location closest to them.\nAnd we continued to invest in our Same-Day Delivery service, adding nine new dedicated sites and serving 18 additional U.S. cities over the course of the year. We shared our plans last year to double the number of sites in the coming years and currently operate more than 55 dedicated Same-Day sites across the U.S. These smaller sites are hybrid\u2014part fulfillment center, part delivery station. They allow us to fulfill, sort, and deliver products all from one site so we can get products out to our customers even quicker. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight in the U.S. by more than 65% year over year. In the UK, more than 70% of Prime member orders arrived the same or next day in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nEven faster delivery speeds in 2024\nAfter reaching our fastest delivery speeds ever in 2023, we\u2019re working to get even faster in 2024. We\u2019re continuing to reimagine our operations network, harnessing the power of AI to place even more items in just the right places to anticipate and meet customer demand. We also plan to further expand our Same-Day Delivery service to reach more customers. Delivering packages faster isn\u2019t a matter of moving faster within our facilities\u2014it\u2019s being smarter about our structure and product placement. We\u2019ll continue to make our workplaces safer, even as we get faster. Our recordable incident rate continues to improve year over year and is down double-digit percentages since 2019.\nHere\u2019s a bit more detail about how we\u2019re working toward making 2024 our fastest year ever:\n1. Shipping more products from locations closer to customers\nWe\u2019ll continue to optimize our operations network with the goal of shipping more products from locations closer to customers, helping to not only speed up deliveries, but also reduce the travel distance and stops per package. In the U.S., we\u2019ll refine our regionalization model, making sure each region is the right size, efficient, and operating smoothly. This will require tweaks and adjustments over time, especially as our fulfillment network and delivery options grow.\nLast year, we also introduced a robotics storage system called Sequoia to a fulfillment center in Houston, Texas. Sequoia allows Amazon to identify and store inventory up to 75% faster and, when integrated with other technologies, will reduce order process time by up to 25%. The system also supports employee safety by collecting inventory into totes and bringing the totes to newly designed ergonomic workstations, reducing how often employees have to reach or squat down to pick customer orders. We look forward to rolling out this robotics storage system at more facilities in 2024.\nAround the world, we\u2019re working to make sure more of the products our customers want are stocked locally and in the right buildings within each region. With the help of AI, we\u2019re able to expand the selection of products that we keep as close as possible to customers, stocking more everyday essentials that our customers order and re-order consistently (think paper towels and dog food). This means more customers can get the items they want most frequently even faster.\nAs part of this, we\u2019re evolving how products come into our fulfillment centers from vendors and our selling partners. In 2023, we spent a lot of time making sure the products that leave our buildings get out faster and more efficiently. This year, we\u2019re making sure the same is true for the products coming in. The goal is for our operations teams to have a better sense of what inventory\u2014and how much of it\u2014is coming in, which will allow them to align that inventory to what customers in that particular region want and need, helping to make our whole process more efficient.\n2.\u00a0Growing our Same-Day Delivery service globally\nAmazon now offers Same-Day Delivery in more than 110 U.S. metro areas, from San Francisco, Boston, and Atlanta to Cedar Rapids, Daytona Beach, and Baton Rouge, and in more than 135 cities and towns across Europe, from London, Paris, and Berlin to Glasgow, Lille and Bremen. This year, we also plan to add sites across a variety of U.S. metro areas, and, around the world, we aim to offer more products customers want and need the same or next day.\nWe know these fast-turn deliveries are important for customers. The last Same-Day Delivery order on Christmas Eve was placed at 5:00 p.m. PT in Orange County, California\u2014for a toddler\u2019s counting and color-sorting set\u2014and it was delivered less than three hours later, at 7:35 p.m. PT.\nIn December, we also celebrated the delivery of our billionth package from a Same-Day site in the U.S.\u2014wireless noise-cancelling earbuds for a customer in Mahwah, New Jersey.\nFor services like Amazon Pharmacy (for which I\u2019m an active and happy customer) we have Same-Day Delivery available in Seattle, Austin, Indianapolis, Miami, and Phoenix.\n3. Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies\nWe\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas.\nWe\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location.\nMany years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.\nSign up for the weekly Amazon newsletter\nWhat is Amazon Day Delivery?

    "Document2": "How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? [DHL Delivery Time]\nEvery time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver?\nDHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites.\nRead on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it.\nHow Long Does DHL Take to Deliver?\nDHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites.\nDHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily.\nThis logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments.\nDHL Delivery Times\nTo answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines:\nThe process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them.\nUnder this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support.\nWith the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this.\nAs for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them.\nDHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping.\nHow long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days.\nHowever, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month.\nAside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time.

Again, the delivery time depends on several factors.\nDHL Delivery Delays\nDHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others.\nWhen these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

Expanding our delivery network to reach more geographies We\u2019re always innovating to reach customers where they are, regardless of location. That includes expanding our Amazon logistics delivery network to reach more rural customers, and tailoring our delivery modes in more densely populated areas to include bikes, walkers, and deliveries from local businesses such as bodegas. We\u2019ve also made exciting progress on our Prime Air drone delivery program: At our facility in College Station, Texas, our fastest click-to-delivery time in the fourth quarter of 2023 was 15 minutes and 29 seconds, for a box of Annie\u2019s Cocoa and Vanilla Bunny Cookies. This year, we\u2019re looking forward to expanding Prime Air to the UK, Italy, and a new U.S. location. Many years ago, I remember Jeff Bezos talking about the difference between a leader and a caretaker. Put simply, he said, a leader is going to keep pushing to make something better, instead of maintaining the status quo. A leader is going to try new, innovative ideas, even though they\u2019re challenging or time consuming or seem confusing at first. This is very much how I think about what we\u2019re doing right now with speed. We\u2019re immensely proud of our progress so far, but we aren\u2019t satisfied and know there\u2019s more we can do. Our work on delivery speeds is global, multi-year effort, and we know has massive runway for us to continue delivering ever faster for customers.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Every time you need to deliver a package, DHL never fails to come to mind. It\u2019s because DHL is a global leader in the logistics industry. But how long does DHL take to deliver? DHL\u2019s delivery time varies because it greatly depends on several factors. Among these are the type of product to deliver and the destination. For neighboring countries, delivery time can take 2 to 3 days. Whereas, for countries with long distances, it can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services typically indicate the expected delivery time on their websites. Read on to learn more about how long does DHL take to deliver and other topics related to it. How Long Does DHL Take to Deliver? DHL delivery for neighboring countries usually takes 2 to 3 days. DHL delivery for countries with long distances can take up to 20 days. Merchants who use DHL services normally post the expected delivery time on their websites. DHL International GmbH, or simply DHL, is a global express mail, package delivery, and courier service. It delivers more than a billion parcels annually and ships to over 200 countries daily. This logistics company is greatly recognized for its reliability in delivering products and services. It is also known for offering competitive rates in terms of international shipments. DHL Delivery Times To answer your question on how long does DHL Express take to deliver, they follow three timelines: The process for all these timelines is basically the same. But let me briefly explain each one of them. Under this timeline, DHL Express performs a door-to-door delivery on or before 9:00 AM. If you don\u2019t receive the package, you have the right to get your money back. All you have to do is to coordinate with DHL Express Customer Support. With the DHL Express at 10:30, expect a door-to-door delivery on or before 10:30 AM. So, if the package does not arrive, you have the right to get your money back. Contact DHL Customer Support to know how to go about this. As for the DHL Express 12:00, you will receive your door-to-door delivery package on or before 12:00 noon. Similarly, you have the right to get your money back if the package is not delivered to you. All you have to do is to contact DHL Customer Support and coordinate with them. DHL follows a strict process before parcels are delivered. The delivery time depends on the place of origin and the destination of the delivery. Also, before delivering the package, DHL practices due diligence to ensure that the items to be delivered are all legal. They then determine the exact cost of the package and then queue it for shipping. How long does DHL Express take to deliver? In most cases, it takes them 4 to 5 days to deliver an international package. But if you\u2019re wondering how long it takes DHL to ship from China to the United States, it usually takes 2 to 3 days. However, in case you don\u2019t want to get the express services of DHL, the delivery time will be a little longer. Some deliveries can take up to 20 days or even a month. Aside from the place of origin and destination, there are other factors affecting delivery time. These include the shape, size, and type of the item inside the package. Suffice it to say that these are also the factors affecting delivery cost. DHL Domestic and International Shipping Time For domestic deliveries, shipping typically takes roughly 3 to 8 business days. This applies to standard shipping. As for DHL\u2019s international shipping, the standard shipping takes approximately 1 to 3 weeks. At the same time, its expedited shipping takes 4 to 12 business days. Again, the delivery time depends on several factors. DHL Delivery Delays DHL follows strict timelines to make sure that all packages are delivered on time. However, there are unavoidable circumstances that cause delays in deliveries. These circumstances include bad weather conditions and traffic, among others. When these situations occur, DHL makes sure that its customers are informed and are warned that there may be some delays.

The most significant have included the US-China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic-era consumer goods boom and the Russia-Ukraine war. Supply chain disruptions have also included a variety of natural disasters, financial failures and operational difficulties.\nSupply chain activity has normalized in operational terms during 2023, but there are significant risks across the industrial policy, labor action and environmental policy implementation spheres heading into 2024.\nSupply chains need to be more resilient, but questions remain over whether corporations and their investors are willing to make the investments necessary to fortify them.\nThe Take\nGlobal supply chains largely normalized in 2023 after years of disruption, and the need for resilience is clear. The willingness of corporations to build that resiliency is not.\nFalling operating margins and higher interest rates may be leading companies to cut their inventory balances and reverse recent supplier diversification increases.\nThere is no shortage of technology available to enable supply chain resilience, with generative AI as the latest example. Most companies need to see short-term returns on investment, and recent experiences with blockchain, for instance, are leaving some hesitant.\nOrganizational alignments are necessary to ensure continuing supply chain resilience. Tools for success include increased engagement with labor unions, geographic diversification with an eye to mitigating operational risk, closer tracking of environment profiles, reshoring and enhanced supplier engagement to manage tariff and geopolitical risk.\nPaying for Resilience in a High-Cost Environment\nS&P Global Market Intelligence data indicates that gross operating profit margins for manufacturers globally are expected to fall to 10.4% of sales in 2024 from 10.7% in 2022. The decline is expected to be particularly stark for the computing and electronics sector and domestic appliance manufacturing. At the same time, capital expenditures are forecast to exceed gross operating profits by 5% in 2024 after being equal to them in 2022. Reinvesting in capital stock may take priority over spending on supply chains.\nEmpty shelves were one of the most tangible signs of supply chain challenges during the pandemic era. The shortage of inventories, whether of toilet paper or computer chips, led many companies to over-order and subsequently cut stock levels in late 2022 and into 2023.\nData from the S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) indicates that manufacturing stocks of finished goods were in retreat for eight of the first nine months of 2023. Destocking has been particularly notable in computing, which has been going on for 27 months while the downturn in consumer goods has been more sporadic.\nThe evidence from corporate financial data is mixed. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the Russell 3000 group of manufacturers and retailers of goods was 54.1% on a trailing three-month basis as of Sept. 30 compared to 50.1% on average for the 2016 to 2019 period. The elevated level is not necessarily evidence of a change in inventory patterns, as it is below the 54.8% peak reached in March.\nThe increase is also caused by just a handful of sectors. The apparel sector has an inventory-to-sales ratio of 74.7% versus 68.6% historically, while electronics excluding semiconductors stands at 39.1% versus its historical average of 29.9%.\nSectors with longer sales cycles are closer to balance. In the case of household durable goods, the inventory-to-sales ratio of 55.0% in September is well below the 64.7% peak of a 2022 and in line with the 54.9% historic average.\nDiversification of suppliers and reshoring are not the same thing. Both can reduce the inherent risk of a supply chain, and they often go hand-in-hand. However, diversification of suppliers can come in and out of fashion depending on the need for cost reductions.\nWith a focus on cost cutting in 2024, there may be less diversification as companies seek to shorten their supplier lists by pushing more orders to fewer suppliers to get better prices.\nThe number of suppliers per ultimate consignee for US seaborne imports for all industrial companies \u2014 nonfinancial, logistics or services \u2014 among the top 500 US importers increased by 13% in 2021 compared to 2019, indicating the use of more suppliers to deal with disruptions.\nThat increase in suppliers broadly started to reverse in 2022 and fell below pre-pandemic levels in the 12 months through Sept. 30, 2023. At a sector level, consumer goods companies registered one of the steepest drop-offs in suppliers. Similarly, the pool of suppliers for consumer durables companies \u2014 including furniture, appliances and leisure goods \u2014 expanded through 2021 but has contracted since then, dropping below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe auto industry\u2019s supplier pool has crested but remained elevated, potentially reflecting the secular shift to electric auto production while maintaining internal combustion engine production. Electronics has also remained elevated after a drop in 2022.\nChris Rogers is the Head of Supply Chain Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nMark Fontecchio is a Research Analyst, covering the Internet of Things, 451 Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nAmy Chang is the Lead Analyst at Panjiva, S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nEmilee Nason is a Data Scientist at Panjiva, S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nTo read the full report, click here.\nContact\nWashington International Trade Association (WITA)\nRonald Reagan Building and International Trade Center\n1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Suite G-329\nWashington, DC 20004\nwita@wita.org\nT (202) 312-1600\nF (202) 312-1601\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024.

No matter where, no matter when, there is always something that could and likely will impact the group\u2019s supply chain.\nMotter\u2019s predecessors at Group Logistics also dealt with disruptions. Employees at Volkswagen Konzernlogistik, as it is incorporated in Germany, have long worked in close collaboration with plants, brand logistics, procurement and manufacturing teams to keep delivery and production stable. Group Logistics was also already responsible for prioritising and allocating critical inventory, when necessary, where decisions needed to be made across plants and brands.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions.\u201d\u2013Simon Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nHowever, scarcity in supply and capacity has intensified the need for this central steering and collaboration. At the worst points of supply shortages, Group Logistics was orchestrating daily supply and production decisions, notably in a taskforce for semiconductors. Motter says that extreme volatility has turned \u201ccrisis management into day-to-day operations\u201d for his team and all logistics functions in the group. They now have a better grip on key supply chain requirements and have adapted processes and tools to support them, even taking direct control of transport capacity where required.\nAnd the results have paid off. Whilst there are still risks in semiconductor supply, the situation is much more stable. For vehicle logistics, which has faced more than 18 months of bottlenecks, delivery performance in Europe has considerably improved, helping the Volkswagen Group to a strong delivery volume at the end of 2023.\n\nDigitalising and designing the supply chain\nSource: Volkswagen\nGroup Logistics is helping to lead on strategic initiatives, including automating and digitalising processes, and influencing supplier, sourcing and manufacturing decisions\nMeanwhile, crises which would have previously caused production stoppages and delivery shortages, including widespread transport-related strikes in Germany and diversions from Red Sea shipping routes, have led to few disruptions thus far. Motter credits these results to better anticipation and finding alternatives earlier in production, supply and transport, as well as better communication with stakeholders. For vehicle logistics, Group Logistics has worked with its partners to secure more capacity directly where needed. In the response to the Red Sea issues, the company has not only diverted ships \u2013 material for Volkswagen factories has even been trucked from China to Europe.\nBut whilst this task-force orientation has brought Group Logistics deeper into the layers of the supply chain, Simon Motter knows that it will be just as important to keep Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain resilient over the long term. Motter believes strongly that logistics should be involved at the earliest stages of product and sourcing decisions, and thus help to ensure that changes to the production network avoid unnecessary cost, risk and emissions.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions,\u201d he says.\nThat influence has been increasingly evident across strategic priorities, including ramping up battery electric vehicle volumes, meeting sustainability targets and controlling costs. For example, Group Logistics has worked with plants in Zwickau and Braunschweig, Germany and Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic to develop and implement an automated loading system to handle and transport battery modules by rail, which it will expand this year. Experts from Group Logistics have also worked closely with the carmaker\u2019s PowerCo battery cell subsidiary, helping to choose locations and develop the infrastructure and requirements for the gigafactory it is building in Salzgitter and those it has confirmed to launch in Spain and Canada.\n\u201cThat is one of the best things that can happen for us as a logistics organisation \u2013 that we are able to redesign something, and that is exactly what we are doing for electrification and batteries with our production network, our processes and technologies,\u201d says Motter.\n\nSecuring a sustainable future\nSource: MAN\nVolkswagen Group Logistics is working with partners, including group truckmaker MAN and its logistics providers, to implement the first electric trucks into its logistics network in Germany this year\nGroup Logistics is also using lower emission transport and encouraging logistics providers to use greener technology and alternative fuels. This year it will see the first full electric trucks go into operation for Volkswagen\u2019s material logistics in its collecting service network, which for example will see one of its partner in Germany, Duvenbeck, using e-trucks from MAN, also part of the Volkswagen Group.\nAlong with zero emission technology, Motter emphasises \u2018defossilisaiton\u2019 of its logistics operations, including for deep-sea shipping. This year, Group Logistics, which has long-term charters of pure-car-and-truck carriers (PCTCs), will continue to bring into operation in total four new dual fuel LNG ships, which will also have capabilities to use other, lower emission technology and fuels.\nDigitalisation has also been one of Motter\u2019s strategic pillars for gaining supply chain resilience, whether implementing microservices in transport systems, analysing the potential of artificial intelligence applications or leading on enterprise-wide changes. For example, Group Logistics is deeply involved in moving from legacy systems in inbound logistics to a cloud-based, SAP 4/Hana ERP that will eventually cover operations such as transport order management, warehouse, yard and plant logistics. Group Logistics is leading on the project, called \u2018ONE Log\u2019, which includes more than 200 cross-functional employees on the integration across production, plant logistics, IT and finance.\nMotter is also looking at global opportunities to improve logistics performance. In North America, where Volkswagen is adding new products across existing operations in the US and Mexico and new plants both for PowerCo and its new EV truck brand, Scout, he has supported initiatives with local brand entities to deepen existing synergies in the region.\n\nOliver Bronder, head of vehicle logistics at Volkswagen Group Logistics, will be a keynote speaker at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Europe, March 19-21 in Bonn, Germany. The conference will feature major OEMs, suppliers and industry experts discussing how to leverage logistics as a competitive advantage.

With uncertainty in the economy and the pace of EV demand, and rising competition among established and newer players in Europe, including from China, carmakers like Volkswagen will have to make considerable savings to remain competitive. Motter admits that will include significant efforts to reduce logistics costs.\nBut he also sees this objective as an opportunity for supply chain leaders to exert greater influence on strategic decision, including where it makes sense to localise supply chains. \u201cIf the individual logistics costs rise, as they have in almost every index across the industry including for Volkswagen, then we have to think about different levers, from the choice of transport carriers to sourcing,\u201d he says.\nGroup Logistics is increasingly involved in identifying those levers. For new products and projects, it now develops what it calls \u2018ideal logistics\u2019 \u2013 an outline of what the most efficient supply chain and infrastructure would look like for an efficient logistics flow. This \u2018ideal\u2019 then becomes a basis to measure and compare with other objectives across procurement, finance and production. \u201cWe then go into discussion. For example, logistics would want to ensure that we have large modules located in a park that is connected to the assembly line with conveyor technology, or to have key suppliers able to deliver from close distances,\u201d Motter says.\nCompromises are always necessary, however the arguments for localisation and other logistics considerations are coming to the fore. \u201cThere are costs and efficiency reasons to consider, but increasingly also sustainability and resiliency reasons \u2013 and on these points our voice is being heard,\u201d Motter says.\nGroup Logistics: seeking synergies, governing standards, building consensus\n Volkswagen Konzernlogistik GmbH, or Group Logistics, is a limited liability company based in Wolfsburg, Germany, wholly owned by Volkswagen Group. With more than 800 employees, it is the central and coordinating organisation of the group\u2019s logistics, but with a special set of functions ranging from the highly operational \u2013 including managing PCTC fleets and a returnable packaging network \u2013 to setting processes and standards across the entire group\u2019s logistics.\n\nSimon Motter, head of Volkswagen Group Logistics\u00a0\nSource: Volkswagen\nSimon Motter took over as managing director of Volkswagen Konzernlogistik (Group Logistics) in January 2021 after working across logistics and plant functions since 1999, mainly with Audi\nSimon Motter has been managing director and head of Group Logistics since January 2021, leading the full scope of the organisation. He previously held a range of logistics roles at Audi, including as head of international logistics, material logistics at Audi\u2019s engine plant in Hungary, and most recently as head of plant logistics for the carmaker\u2019s plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Motter reports to Christian Vollmer, board member for production at Volkswagen.\nEach brand of the Volkswagen Group is responsible for programme planning and logistics flows across their own plants, with factories usually responsible for plant logistics. Group Logistics, meanwhile, manages international material and vehicle logistics, along with synergies across multiple brands and shared suppliers. In Europe, where the group has the most plants and largest volume, Group Logistics operates material logistics, container management and vehicle logistics as a joint network, including cross-brand network design and forward planning, and the use of logistics digitalisation tools. Group Logistics also manages cross-company steering of critical parts and inventory. During the chip crisis, for example, it allocated chip supply based on company-wide priorities.\nAs a limited company, Group Logistics is responsible for purchasing and contracting for material and vehicle logistics services across Europe, and cross-regional flows. It also directly charters ro-ro ships, especially for Europe-North America trade.\nIt is a scope that continues to evolve. Recently, Group Logistics incorporated used car logistics into its European operations. During recent vehicle logistics capacity shortages, it chartered and commissioned vehicle logistics carriers across the continent as well.\nMotter emphasises the \u2018governance\u2019 role among the most important for Group Logistics, such as setting network structures, standards and best practice, as well as coordinating cross-brand and functional projects. \u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task,\u201d says Motter.\n\u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task.\u201d \u2013Simon\u00a0Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nThis cooperation is often developed in working groups, in which a Group Logistics manager brings together leaders and experts from brand logistics, plants and other functions in a \u2018group management circle\u2019. These groups meet regularly to align on synergies and opportunities, as well as to settle political and technical issues. It\u2019s a consensus-building body, but also one that uses tools and data to advise and take critical decisions where necessary, for example on logistics infrastructure, inventory and network design.\nWhile the group has direct responsible for international transports, it does not usually take operational roles in global regions. Here, however, the governance role is important for developing standards and sharing best practice across entities. However, with the growth of key overseas regions, Group Logistics and its partner entities are aligning more closely.\n\nDeveloping global synergies\nSource: Volkswagen\nWhilst in Europe Group Logistics take direct resonsibilities for many areas of material, vehicle logistics and packaging, globally it has more of a governance role. However, it is increasingly working with regions and local entities to collaborate across the network\nIn China, for example, where Volkswagen Group operates across joint ventures with different Chinese companies, there is no single, countrywide shared logistics network. However, its JVs are exploring common logistics efficiencies, including establishing a returnable container management network closely modelled on the setup and system that Group Logistics runs in Europe, according to Motter.\nIn North America, Motter and Group Logistics are directly supporting regional efforts to find cross-brand and cross-country synergies. Volkswagen Group companies are building new factories, including for the Scout EV truck brand in South Carolina and battery cell maker PowerCo in Canada. Volkswagen Group is also investing across existing factories in the US and Mexico for Volkswagen and Audi, as well as commercial vehicle brands Navistar and Volkswagen Truck & Bus.\nWhilst regional logistics and brand teams remain responsible for logistics in these regions, Group Logistics has done network studies on the region\u2019s material logistics and production networks. At the Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Mexico conference in November 2023, leaders from regional logistics leaders, together with Group Logistics head of global transport networks Christoph Hartmann, highlighted opportunities including cross-border flows, crossdocking, less-than-truckload and container management. The regional brands are currently planning tenders for some combined logistics services in the region.\n\u201cIt is precisely our job in Group Logistics to exercise global governance on the one hand, and to leverage synergies concretely,\u201d says Motter.\nThe synergy analysis is currently focused on material logistics and containers, but could expand to vehicle logistics within North America, where there are shared responsibilities between Volkswagen Group of America, and different brands in Mexico. But the company has yet to determine the pace of such developments, says Motter.\u00a0\nHe also does not rule out the possibility that the group would eventually incorporate an entity in North America like Group Logistics in Germany, which could bundle certain services together. \u201cThe question arises, of course, but there is no definitive answer yet, as the business model may need to be different,\u201d Motter says. \u201cBut we believe that sharing networks, as we do here in Europe, makes sense in North America.\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important to take the first steps and to get concrete results, and then go forward from there,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nTopics\nVolkswagen Group Logistics series: Simon Motter on securing the supply chain\nHow Group Logistics is overcoming crises and shaping Volkswagen's future supply chain\nReady for any crisis, anywhere in Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain\nThe electrifying influence of logistics\nThe many roads, fuels and tech leading to zero emission logistics at Volkswagen Group\nThe quest for one source of truth in Volkswagen Group\u2019s digital supply chain\nRelated articles\n\nVolkswagen Group\u2019s North America vehicle logistics approach saves cost and delivery time\n\n\n2024-06-17T14:04:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nVolkswagen relies on localisation in Europe for EV project\n\n\n2024-06-03T11:11:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nHoerndlein to lead vehicle logistics for Volkswagen Group Logistics; Bronder moves to SAIC JV\n\n\n2024-05-29T15:43:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nOn the right track for rail investment\n\n\n2024-05-03T15:08:00Z\n\n\nBy Marcus Williams\n\n\nDuvenbeck switches to biogas for ZF\n\n\n2024-03-12T10:49:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nDuvenbeck expands into Benelux through Schotpoort Logistics takeover\n\n\n2024-03-04T15:30:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nMore Volkswagen\n\nLogistics in another dimension for SAIC VW in China\n\n\n2022-06-06T21:00:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams and  Christopher Ludwig\n\nSusanne Lehmann, who leads logistics at SAIC Volkswagen, reveals how the JV has managed lockdowns in China and is advancing digitalisation and supply partnerships\n\nVW opens IT centre in Dresden\n\n\n2019-06-26T10:41:00Z\nBy Steve Garnsey\n\nGerman carmaker\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0(VW)\u00a0has opened a new\u00a0production software development centre (SDC) at\u00a0its\u00a0showcase\u00a0Gl\u00e4serne Manufaktur\u00a0site in Dresden\u2026\n\nVolkswagen Group part 2: Talking \u2018then and now\u2019 with head of group logistics, Thomas Zernechel\n\n\n2017-10-10T13:09:00Z\nBy Christopher Ludwig\n\nThe group\u2019s head of group logistics talks about the major changes seen over the past two decades \u2013 and why he is optimistic about the future of logistics\nAutomotive Logistics is the leading resource for automotive logistics and supply chain professionals globally.\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\nYour free registration includes:\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud\n",
    "Summarized_Document1": "Global supply chains have faced numerous disruptions over the past decade, including the US-China trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine war. Natural disasters, financial failures, and operational difficulties have also played a role. While supply chain activity normalized in 2023, significant risks remain in industrial policy, labor action, and environmental policy implementation as we head into 2024. The need for resilient supply chains is clear, but corporations and investors may be hesitant to make the necessary investments due to falling operating margins and higher interest rates. S&P Global Market Intelligence data shows that gross operating profit margins for manufacturers globally are expected to fall to 10.4% of sales in 2024 from 10.7% in 2022. This decline is particularly stark for the computing and electronics sector and domestic appliance manufacturing. Capital expenditures are forecast to exceed gross operating profits by 5% in 2024, indicating a priority on reinvesting in capital stock over supply chains. Empty shelves were a common sight during the pandemic, leading many companies to over-order and subsequently cut stock levels in late 2022 and into 2023. The S&P Global Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) indicates that manufacturing stocks of finished goods were in retreat for eight of the first nine months of 2023. Destocking has been particularly notable in computing, ongoing for 27 months, while the downturn in consumer goods has been more sporadic. Corporate financial data shows mixed evidence. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the Russell 3000 group of manufacturers and retailers was 54.1% on a trailing three-month basis as of Sept. 30, compared to 50.1% on average for the 2016 to 2019 period. The elevated level is not necessarily a change in inventory patterns, as it is below the 54.8% peak reached in March. The increase is driven by a few sectors, with apparel having an inventory-to-sales ratio of 74.7% versus 68.6% historically, and electronics excluding semiconductors at 39.1% versus a historical average of 29.9%. Sectors with longer sales cycles are closer to balance. Household durable goods had an inventory-to-sales ratio of 55.0% in September, well below the 64.7% peak of 2022 and in line with the 54.9% historic average. Supplier diversification and reshoring are strategies to reduce supply chain risk, but they are not the same. Diversification can come in and out of fashion depending on cost reduction needs. In 2024, there may be less diversification as companies push more orders to fewer suppliers for better prices. The number of suppliers per ultimate consignee for US seaborne imports increased by 13% in 2021 compared to 2019 but started to reverse in 2022, falling below pre-pandemic levels by Sept. 30, 2023. Consumer goods and consumer durables companies saw significant drops in suppliers. The auto industry\u2019s supplier pool has remained elevated, reflecting the shift to electric auto production. Electronics also remained elevated after a drop in 2022.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Volkswagen Group Logistics, under the leadership of Simon Motter since January 2021, has significantly improved its resilience to supply chain disruptions. The company has faced numerous crises, including semiconductor shortages, shipping schedule misalignments, and supplier impacts due to geopolitical events. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen has managed to stabilize its supply chain through digitalization, investment, and effective partner management. The company operates across 115 plants and collaborates with 8,100 suppliers globally.Key strategies include the digitalization of processes, direct control of transport capacity, and better communication with stakeholders. For instance, during the semiconductor shortage, Volkswagen's Group Logistics orchestrated daily supply and production decisions, which helped stabilize the situation. The company has also implemented automated loading systems for battery modules and is working on electrification and sustainability initiatives, such as introducing electric trucks and dual-fuel LNG ships.Group Logistics plays a crucial role in strategic decisions, influencing costs, emissions, and supply chain stability. The organization is involved in early stages of product and sourcing decisions to avoid unnecessary risks and costs. It also focuses on 'defossilization' of logistics operations and is exploring the use of artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems for better supply chain management.In North America, Volkswagen is expanding its operations with new factories and investments in existing ones. Group Logistics is supporting these efforts by identifying synergies and optimizing logistics networks. The company is also exploring the possibility of establishing a similar logistics entity in North America to bundle services and improve efficiency.Overall, Volkswagen Group Logistics has become more relevant in influencing strategic decisions, ensuring stability, and controlling costs and emissions. The organization continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies and practices to maintain a resilient and efficient supply chain.",

No matter where, no matter when, there is always something that could and likely will impact the group\u2019s supply chain.\nMotter\u2019s predecessors at Group Logistics also dealt with disruptions. Employees at Volkswagen Konzernlogistik, as it is incorporated in Germany, have long worked in close collaboration with plants, brand logistics, procurement and manufacturing teams to keep delivery and production stable. Group Logistics was also already responsible for prioritising and allocating critical inventory, when necessary, where decisions needed to be made across plants and brands.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions.\u201d\u2013Simon Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nHowever, scarcity in supply and capacity has intensified the need for this central steering and collaboration. At the worst points of supply shortages, Group Logistics was orchestrating daily supply and production decisions, notably in a taskforce for semiconductors. Motter says that extreme volatility has turned \u201ccrisis management into day-to-day operations\u201d for his team and all logistics functions in the group. They now have a better grip on key supply chain requirements and have adapted processes and tools to support them, even taking direct control of transport capacity where required.\nAnd the results have paid off. Whilst there are still risks in semiconductor supply, the situation is much more stable. For vehicle logistics, which has faced more than 18 months of bottlenecks, delivery performance in Europe has considerably improved, helping the Volkswagen Group to a strong delivery volume at the end of 2023.\n\nDigitalising and designing the supply chain\nSource: Volkswagen\nGroup Logistics is helping to lead on strategic initiatives, including automating and digitalising processes, and influencing supplier, sourcing and manufacturing decisions\nMeanwhile, crises which would have previously caused production stoppages and delivery shortages, including widespread transport-related strikes in Germany and diversions from Red Sea shipping routes, have led to few disruptions thus far. Motter credits these results to better anticipation and finding alternatives earlier in production, supply and transport, as well as better communication with stakeholders. For vehicle logistics, Group Logistics has worked with its partners to secure more capacity directly where needed. In the response to the Red Sea issues, the company has not only diverted ships \u2013 material for Volkswagen factories has even been trucked from China to Europe.\nBut whilst this task-force orientation has brought Group Logistics deeper into the layers of the supply chain, Simon Motter knows that it will be just as important to keep Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain resilient over the long term. Motter believes strongly that logistics should be involved at the earliest stages of product and sourcing decisions, and thus help to ensure that changes to the production network avoid unnecessary cost, risk and emissions.\n\u201cIn logistics, we have become more relevant and able to influence decisions, both in terms of ensuring stability, but also in terms of costs and emissions,\u201d he says.\nThat influence has been increasingly evident across strategic priorities, including ramping up battery electric vehicle volumes, meeting sustainability targets and controlling costs. For example, Group Logistics has worked with plants in Zwickau and Braunschweig, Germany and Mlada Boleslav, Czech Republic to develop and implement an automated loading system to handle and transport battery modules by rail, which it will expand this year. Experts from Group Logistics have also worked closely with the carmaker\u2019s PowerCo battery cell subsidiary, helping to choose locations and develop the infrastructure and requirements for the gigafactory it is building in Salzgitter and those it has confirmed to launch in Spain and Canada.\n\u201cThat is one of the best things that can happen for us as a logistics organisation \u2013 that we are able to redesign something, and that is exactly what we are doing for electrification and batteries with our production network, our processes and technologies,\u201d says Motter.\n\nSecuring a sustainable future\nSource: MAN\nVolkswagen Group Logistics is working with partners, including group truckmaker MAN and its logistics providers, to implement the first electric trucks into its logistics network in Germany this year\nGroup Logistics is also using lower emission transport and encouraging logistics providers to use greener technology and alternative fuels. This year it will see the first full electric trucks go into operation for Volkswagen\u2019s material logistics in its collecting service network, which for example will see one of its partner in Germany, Duvenbeck, using e-trucks from MAN, also part of the Volkswagen Group.\nAlong with zero emission technology, Motter emphasises \u2018defossilisaiton\u2019 of its logistics operations, including for deep-sea shipping. This year, Group Logistics, which has long-term charters of pure-car-and-truck carriers (PCTCs), will continue to bring into operation in total four new dual fuel LNG ships, which will also have capabilities to use other, lower emission technology and fuels.\nDigitalisation has also been one of Motter\u2019s strategic pillars for gaining supply chain resilience, whether implementing microservices in transport systems, analysing the potential of artificial intelligence applications or leading on enterprise-wide changes. For example, Group Logistics is deeply involved in moving from legacy systems in inbound logistics to a cloud-based, SAP 4/Hana ERP that will eventually cover operations such as transport order management, warehouse, yard and plant logistics. Group Logistics is leading on the project, called \u2018ONE Log\u2019, which includes more than 200 cross-functional employees on the integration across production, plant logistics, IT and finance.\nMotter is also looking at global opportunities to improve logistics performance. In North America, where Volkswagen is adding new products across existing operations in the US and Mexico and new plants both for PowerCo and its new EV truck brand, Scout, he has supported initiatives with local brand entities to deepen existing synergies in the region.\n\nOliver Bronder, head of vehicle logistics at Volkswagen Group Logistics, will be a keynote speaker at Automotive Logistics and Supply Chain Europe, March 19-21 in Bonn, Germany. The conference will feature major OEMs, suppliers and industry experts discussing how to leverage logistics as a competitive advantage.

With uncertainty in the economy and the pace of EV demand, and rising competition among established and newer players in Europe, including from China, carmakers like Volkswagen will have to make considerable savings to remain competitive. Motter admits that will include significant efforts to reduce logistics costs.\nBut he also sees this objective as an opportunity for supply chain leaders to exert greater influence on strategic decision, including where it makes sense to localise supply chains. \u201cIf the individual logistics costs rise, as they have in almost every index across the industry including for Volkswagen, then we have to think about different levers, from the choice of transport carriers to sourcing,\u201d he says.\nGroup Logistics is increasingly involved in identifying those levers. For new products and projects, it now develops what it calls \u2018ideal logistics\u2019 \u2013 an outline of what the most efficient supply chain and infrastructure would look like for an efficient logistics flow. This \u2018ideal\u2019 then becomes a basis to measure and compare with other objectives across procurement, finance and production. \u201cWe then go into discussion. For example, logistics would want to ensure that we have large modules located in a park that is connected to the assembly line with conveyor technology, or to have key suppliers able to deliver from close distances,\u201d Motter says.\nCompromises are always necessary, however the arguments for localisation and other logistics considerations are coming to the fore. \u201cThere are costs and efficiency reasons to consider, but increasingly also sustainability and resiliency reasons \u2013 and on these points our voice is being heard,\u201d Motter says.\nGroup Logistics: seeking synergies, governing standards, building consensus\n Volkswagen Konzernlogistik GmbH, or Group Logistics, is a limited liability company based in Wolfsburg, Germany, wholly owned by Volkswagen Group. With more than 800 employees, it is the central and coordinating organisation of the group\u2019s logistics, but with a special set of functions ranging from the highly operational \u2013 including managing PCTC fleets and a returnable packaging network \u2013 to setting processes and standards across the entire group\u2019s logistics.\n\nSimon Motter, head of Volkswagen Group Logistics\u00a0\nSource: Volkswagen\nSimon Motter took over as managing director of Volkswagen Konzernlogistik (Group Logistics) in January 2021 after working across logistics and plant functions since 1999, mainly with Audi\nSimon Motter has been managing director and head of Group Logistics since January 2021, leading the full scope of the organisation. He previously held a range of logistics roles at Audi, including as head of international logistics, material logistics at Audi\u2019s engine plant in Hungary, and most recently as head of plant logistics for the carmaker\u2019s plant in Ingolstadt, Germany. Motter reports to Christian Vollmer, board member for production at Volkswagen.\nEach brand of the Volkswagen Group is responsible for programme planning and logistics flows across their own plants, with factories usually responsible for plant logistics. Group Logistics, meanwhile, manages international material and vehicle logistics, along with synergies across multiple brands and shared suppliers. In Europe, where the group has the most plants and largest volume, Group Logistics operates material logistics, container management and vehicle logistics as a joint network, including cross-brand network design and forward planning, and the use of logistics digitalisation tools. Group Logistics also manages cross-company steering of critical parts and inventory. During the chip crisis, for example, it allocated chip supply based on company-wide priorities.\nAs a limited company, Group Logistics is responsible for purchasing and contracting for material and vehicle logistics services across Europe, and cross-regional flows. It also directly charters ro-ro ships, especially for Europe-North America trade.\nIt is a scope that continues to evolve. Recently, Group Logistics incorporated used car logistics into its European operations. During recent vehicle logistics capacity shortages, it chartered and commissioned vehicle logistics carriers across the continent as well.\nMotter emphasises the \u2018governance\u2019 role among the most important for Group Logistics, such as setting network structures, standards and best practice, as well as coordinating cross-brand and functional projects. \u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task,\u201d says Motter.\n\u201cIt makes absolute sense that our brands and plants have their own logistics, but we want to find synergies, and to do that we need to find cooperation models to define common standards, which is such an important task.\u201d \u2013Simon\u00a0Motter, Volkswagen Group Logistics\nThis cooperation is often developed in working groups, in which a Group Logistics manager brings together leaders and experts from brand logistics, plants and other functions in a \u2018group management circle\u2019. These groups meet regularly to align on synergies and opportunities, as well as to settle political and technical issues. It\u2019s a consensus-building body, but also one that uses tools and data to advise and take critical decisions where necessary, for example on logistics infrastructure, inventory and network design.\nWhile the group has direct responsible for international transports, it does not usually take operational roles in global regions. Here, however, the governance role is important for developing standards and sharing best practice across entities. However, with the growth of key overseas regions, Group Logistics and its partner entities are aligning more closely.\n\nDeveloping global synergies\nSource: Volkswagen\nWhilst in Europe Group Logistics take direct resonsibilities for many areas of material, vehicle logistics and packaging, globally it has more of a governance role. However, it is increasingly working with regions and local entities to collaborate across the network\nIn China, for example, where Volkswagen Group operates across joint ventures with different Chinese companies, there is no single, countrywide shared logistics network. However, its JVs are exploring common logistics efficiencies, including establishing a returnable container management network closely modelled on the setup and system that Group Logistics runs in Europe, according to Motter.\nIn North America, Motter and Group Logistics are directly supporting regional efforts to find cross-brand and cross-country synergies. Volkswagen Group companies are building new factories, including for the Scout EV truck brand in South Carolina and battery cell maker PowerCo in Canada. Volkswagen Group is also investing across existing factories in the US and Mexico for Volkswagen and Audi, as well as commercial vehicle brands Navistar and Volkswagen Truck & Bus.\nWhilst regional logistics and brand teams remain responsible for logistics in these regions, Group Logistics has done network studies on the region\u2019s material logistics and production networks. At the Automotive Logistics & Supply Chain Mexico conference in November 2023, leaders from regional logistics leaders, together with Group Logistics head of global transport networks Christoph Hartmann, highlighted opportunities including cross-border flows, crossdocking, less-than-truckload and container management. The regional brands are currently planning tenders for some combined logistics services in the region.\n\u201cIt is precisely our job in Group Logistics to exercise global governance on the one hand, and to leverage synergies concretely,\u201d says Motter.\nThe synergy analysis is currently focused on material logistics and containers, but could expand to vehicle logistics within North America, where there are shared responsibilities between Volkswagen Group of America, and different brands in Mexico. But the company has yet to determine the pace of such developments, says Motter.\u00a0\nHe also does not rule out the possibility that the group would eventually incorporate an entity in North America like Group Logistics in Germany, which could bundle certain services together. \u201cThe question arises, of course, but there is no definitive answer yet, as the business model may need to be different,\u201d Motter says. \u201cBut we believe that sharing networks, as we do here in Europe, makes sense in North America.\n\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s important to take the first steps and to get concrete results, and then go forward from there,\u201d he says.\u00a0\nTopics\nVolkswagen Group Logistics series: Simon Motter on securing the supply chain\nHow Group Logistics is overcoming crises and shaping Volkswagen's future supply chain\nReady for any crisis, anywhere in Volkswagen Group\u2019s supply chain\nThe electrifying influence of logistics\nThe many roads, fuels and tech leading to zero emission logistics at Volkswagen Group\nThe quest for one source of truth in Volkswagen Group\u2019s digital supply chain\nRelated articles\n\nVolkswagen Group\u2019s North America vehicle logistics approach saves cost and delivery time\n\n\n2024-06-17T14:04:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nVolkswagen relies on localisation in Europe for EV project\n\n\n2024-06-03T11:11:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nHoerndlein to lead vehicle logistics for Volkswagen Group Logistics; Bronder moves to SAIC JV\n\n\n2024-05-29T15:43:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nOn the right track for rail investment\n\n\n2024-05-03T15:08:00Z\n\n\nBy Marcus Williams\n\n\nDuvenbeck switches to biogas for ZF\n\n\n2024-03-12T10:49:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\n\nDuvenbeck expands into Benelux through Schotpoort Logistics takeover\n\n\n2024-03-04T15:30:00Z\n\n\nBy Megan Kelly\n\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nMore Volkswagen\n\nLogistics in another dimension for SAIC VW in China\n\n\n2022-06-06T21:00:00Z\nBy Marcus Williams and  Christopher Ludwig\n\nSusanne Lehmann, who leads logistics at SAIC Volkswagen, reveals how the JV has managed lockdowns in China and is advancing digitalisation and supply partnerships\n\nVW opens IT centre in Dresden\n\n\n2019-06-26T10:41:00Z\nBy Steve Garnsey\n\nGerman carmaker\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0(VW)\u00a0has opened a new\u00a0production software development centre (SDC) at\u00a0its\u00a0showcase\u00a0Gl\u00e4serne Manufaktur\u00a0site in Dresden\u2026\n\nVolkswagen Group part 2: Talking \u2018then and now\u2019 with head of group logistics, Thomas Zernechel\n\n\n2017-10-10T13:09:00Z\nBy Christopher Ludwig\n\nThe group\u2019s head of group logistics talks about the major changes seen over the past two decades \u2013 and why he is optimistic about the future of logistics\nAutomotive Logistics is the leading resource for automotive logistics and supply chain professionals globally.\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\n\nJoin today to access Automotive Logistics\u2019 wealth of global news, insights, intelligence and to make important connections across the automotive industry.\n\nYour free registration includes:\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud\n",

    "Summarized_Document2": "Volkswagen Group Logistics, under the leadership of Simon Motter since January 2021, has significantly improved its resilience to supply chain disruptions. The company has faced numerous crises, including semiconductor shortages, shipping schedule misalignments, and supplier impacts due to geopolitical events. Despite these challenges, Volkswagen has managed to stabilize its supply chain through digitalization, investment, and effective partner management. The company operates across 115 plants and collaborates with 8,100 suppliers globally.Key strategies include the digitalization of processes, direct control of transport capacity, and better communication with stakeholders. For instance, during the semiconductor shortage, Volkswagen's Group Logistics orchestrated daily supply and production decisions, which helped stabilize the situation. The company has also implemented automated loading systems for battery modules and is working on electrification and sustainability initiatives, such as introducing electric trucks and dual-fuel LNG ships.Group Logistics plays a crucial role in strategic decisions, influencing costs, emissions, and supply chain stability. The organization is involved in early stages of product and sourcing decisions to avoid unnecessary risks and costs. It also focuses on 'defossilization' of logistics operations and is exploring the use of artificial intelligence and cloud-based systems for better supply chain management.In North America, Volkswagen is expanding its operations with new factories and investments in existing ones. Group Logistics is supporting these efforts by identifying synergies and optimizing logistics networks. The company is also exploring the possibility of establishing a similar logistics entity in North America to bundle services and improve efficiency.Overall, Volkswagen Group Logistics has become more relevant in influencing strategic decisions, ensuring stability, and controlling costs and emissions. The organization continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies and practices to maintain a resilient and efficient supply chain.",

We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California\nApartments for Rent in San Diego\nThinking about moving to San Diego, but not sure what you're in for as a renter? We wrote this guide to demystify renting in the area and help you discover whether San Diego is the place for you.\nYou've probably heard a lot about the challenges of housing in California. The SD market isn\u2019t cutthroat like the Bay Area or NYC, but it\u2019s still what you would expect from a growing SoCal metropolis. That said, approach hunting like a job interview: do your homework on neighborhoods and complexes you like, bring the necessary documentation (proof of income, driver\u2019s license, checkbook for a deposit, etc.), and\u2014most importantly\u2014be flexible. There may be features you won\u2019t budge on (proximity to the beach, say), but keep those to a minimum and you\u2019ll have an easier go of it.\nApartment living in SD comes in three forms: your larger, clean and contemporary buildings (expect efficiency but not personality), your smallish, mom-n-pop complexes (think The Big Lebowski), and the classic California cottage (tiny and moldy, but perfect for the Kerouac in all of us). A subcategory might be the \u201cresort-style\u201d or \u201cgated\u201d complex, but these are mainly gobbled up by the retired vacation home demographic in SD.\nSeasonal economic shifts in SD means lots of complexes offer month-to-month leasing options. This is fabulous news for you, dear renter! But there are heaps of other details you\u2019ll need to be privy to. For instance, in most cases, the deposit required depends on your credit report (yes, credit reports are inevitable). An average Joe with good credit typically puts $500 down on an apartment in America\u2019s Finest City; if you\u2019re nervous about credit, don\u2019t turn tail yet\u2014you just may have to pay a higher deposit. Finally, most leases have utilities included (sans gas and electric) and accept pets (either with a flat pet deposit\u2014say, $300\u2014or monthly pet rent, such as $40/month).\nPopular Types of Apartments in San Diego\nCottages ($$$$) are the most expensive and deal mainly in the quaintness department. The floor plans are almost exclusively 1BR/1BA, and you\u2019ll have to elbow out the vacation rental crowd to secure a permanent spot in these babies, but it\u2019s well worth it.\nImportant perks large complexes ($$$) boast are garage parking and a recreational pool that isn't filled with water from old dog bowls. They also offer sundry floor plans: studio, 1BR/1BA, 2BR/1BA, 2BR/2BA, and so on. Typically built in the 90s and 2000s, such behemoths are found nearest large shopping complexes and commercial strips\u2014busy places, in other words. That thick concrete will keep the noise down to a minimum, but you should love the action if you choose to live here.\nThe motel-like mom-n-pop joints ($$) consist of mainly budget 1BR/1BA and 2BR/1BA options\u2014but don\u2019t overlook them. On the off chance the owners have actually renovated the place since the 80s, you can find a pretty rockin\u2019 unit for half the price of the flashy alternative. Plus, you\u2019re more likely to get not only a bed, but also a community (and sometimes, a commune\u2026) out of these arrangements! If you're after an inexpensive apartment in San Diego, start here.\nAverage Rent in San Diego\nThe following rent averages come from current listings on our website.

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions from people who are moving to the city for the first time:\nIs San Diego expensive to rent in?\nAt a median rate of $1,954 for a one-bedroom, San Diego is an expensive city for renters. Using a budgeting rule that says rent should not be more than 30% of your income, we estimate you would need to earn around $90,000 a year to comfortably afford a one-bedroom in the city.\nHow much do you need to make to rent an apartment in San Diego?\nMost landlords require that you earn 2.5x your rent in income. That means you would need to earn at least $4,885 a month, or just under $59,000 a year, to be approved for a one-bedroom at San Diego's current median rate of $1,954.\nIs rent cheaper in LA or San Diego?\nAs of April 2024, San Diego's overall median rent was slightly higher than LA at $2,293 (SD) compared to $2,083 (LA). Rent prices in LA have also fallen by 3.4% while they've only fallen 2.5% in San Diego over the previous year.\nSan Diego Neighborhoods\nPicking a neighborhood in SD is like participating in an NFL draft. Weigh your options: if you use that early-round selection, make sure it\u2019s for something that can deliver. Alternatively, hold out for something still available in a later round\u2014something less flashy, but nevertheless team-oriented and solid beneath the surface.\nDowntown San Diego\nThis is your star wide receiver. He\u2019s consistently a first-round pick. He\u2019ll make some beautiful catches\u2014but he\u2019s fragile, high-maintenance, and pricey. We reckon you\u2019ll be hard-pressed (and that doesn\u2019t have to do with wine\u2026 or olives) to find a studio in the Gaslamp District for less than $2000/month.\nHillcrest\nThe market hits the national average in this area. Think of Hillcrest as the first-string center. He\u2019s well built. He\u2019s got the quarterback\u2019s back if poop hits the fan. But no one notices him until the dog pile clears. If you can manage being more than fifteen blocks from the water, consider a 1BR for $850/month or a 2BR for $1250/month overlooking Balboa Park.\nPoint Loma\nA running back is your most diverse player in football; quick to adapt to new circumstances, he can ensure success\u2014but he takes a serious beating along the way. That\u2019s Point Loma. From the yachts of Harbor Island to the strip of Midway, this place has extremities in spades. Dig diversity? Move here. 1BR/1BAs start at $1000/month, 2BR/1BAs at $1500/month. Oh, and you\u2019d better board that Pomeranian.\nMission Bay/Pacific Beach\nEvery team has its special element. The fireworks component, let\u2019s call it. In football, that means the kicker. These guys send up that gorgeous arc to score the final meager\u2014but crucial!\u2014 field goal. You get the analogy, right? Mission Bay and Pacific Beach bring the funky boardwalk culture to SD. It\u2019s not necessarily an all-the-time kinda sector (well, unless you\u2019re a street mime), but it would be sweet to say you live two blocks from Shamu. Studios can be found for under $1000/month, but you\u2019re more likely to see 1BR/1BA condos ($1400/month) and 2 and 3BR beach houses ($1800/month and $2100/month, respectively).\nOld Town\nAha! Finally. The quarterback. Where all (offensive) plays begin and end. Old Town claims SDSU, Qualcomm Stadium, major shopping complexes, and historic architecture. Downtown has glitz; Old Town has all-around charm. The lack of oceanfront real estate makes this central sector of town a bit less expensive: expect studios and 1BRs for under $1000/month and 2BR/1BAs for around $1500/month.\nLa Jolla\nYeah, yeah\u2014we know we gots to say something about La Jolla, but what? Hmm, let\u2019s see. There\u2019s some beaches there? UCSD? What do you want, people? La Jolla is your second-string kicker, alright?! More of the same funky beach stuff. (But without Shamu; drat!) The market\u2019s gutted here because everyone and their mom think LJ is synonymous with SD. The students help, though: one can find some decent 1BR condos around the university for under $1000/month, but head toward the water and you\u2019ll easily double that.\nGot your pick? Terrific. Now pick garage parking or street. Then upstairs or ground level. Then full bath or 1 1/2. Keep going and you\u2019ll have your fantasy league in no time. Just remember to bring your sunscreen.

    "Document1": "Three ways bikeshare can be more equitable in\u00a0DC\nBicyclingBy Yipeng Su (Urban Institute),\u00a0Robin Wang (Urban Institute) February 15, 2019\u00a021\n CaBi in Petworth by Bekah Richards licensed under Creative Commons.\nThis article was first published by the Urban Institute on February 11, 2019.\nBikesharing has gained popularity in US cities as concerns about health, congestion, and climate change have increased. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America. Since then, Capital Bikeshare users have generated millions of rides, but use and station placement varies around the city.\nThe DC Department of Transportation clearly considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, and the department used online crowdsourcing to allow residents to vote on new station placement. But is bikesharing reinforcing DC\u2019s existing disparities, or is it effectively acting to reverse them?\nTo answer this question, we need data. Unlike many privately owned, dockless bike or scooter sharing services, Capital Bikeshare makes anonymized ridership data available online. We focused our analysis only on registered members (who account for three-quarters of the total trips in DC, compared with casual nonmember users) because these riders are more likely to be local residents. View our methodology (PDF) here.\nWith funding support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we took a closer look at Capital Bikeshare\u2019s potential to address the city\u2019s racial and economic disparities. We placed the 2017 data in the context of DC\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics to identify challenges and opportunities for developing bikeshare equitably. Our analysis revealed two primary challenges.\n1. Station placement isn\u2019t equitable and follows patterns of existing infrastructure.\nDC has 276 Capital Bikeshare stations, distributed in 118 of 179 census tracts (66% of tracts in DC). The density of bikeshare stations varies across neighborhoods. Census tracts with the most stations are generally near popular destinations for tourists and residents, like the National Mall.\nAreas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment tend to have more stations available. On average, tracts in the top quartile in terms of share of white population and income level have more than twice the amount of bike share stations available, compared to tracts in the bottom quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBikeshare station placement generally follows existing transportation infrastructure, such as Metro and Metrobus stations. About 67% of bikeshare stations are located within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% of bikeshare stations are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop.\nRiders also seem to appreciate stations that are closer to a Metro station. Bike stations within a half mile of a Metro station (185 stations) generate 82% of trips, on average.\n2. Station use differs by neighborhood.\nA single bikeshare station at Union Station saw an impressive 60,371 member rides in 2017, but another station near Capitol Heights (61st Street and Banks PIace NE) generated only 51 member rides.\nThe most popular centers during noncommute hours are concentrated in neighborhoods that have low unemployment rates, high income levels, more people with a college degree, and fewer people of color. This trend is consistent with findings from a 2016 survey (PDF) that found 80% of bikeshare members are white.\nUse is clustered in high-income neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes:\u00a0Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nSuch racial disparity is also reflected by the east-west divide made by the Anacostia River. We grouped DC stations by east and west of the river and looked at bikeshare stations and use, and the equity gap is huge. Wards 7 and 8 (east of the Anacostia river), which are predominately black, accounted for 10% of DC\u2019s total stations, but they generated only 0.5% of the total trips in 2017. While 37% of the trips generated from east of the Anacostia ended up across the river, only 0.1% of trips generated from west of the river ended up east of the Anacostia.\nUse is clustered in less diverse neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes: Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nThese data suggest that people lack incentive to use bikeshare services in these neighborhoods, even when stations are available. The five stations that members used the least in 2017 are all stations added to Wards 7 and 8 toward the end of the year as part of the mayor\u2019s effort to expand DC\u2019s bike network. But even excluding these stations, four of the five least-used stations are still east of the Anacostia.\nHow can the city use bikeshare service to support its equity goals?\nBikeshare service could improve mobility and connectivity across DC\u2019s racial and socioeconomic boundaries. But our analysis shows that people don\u2019t use bikeshares more just because they are available, raising perhaps the most important question for planners and decisionmakers: what provides incentive for communities to use bikeshares, and what are the barriers diminishing the incentives for certain communities?\nDrawing from best practices and studies on potential barriers for accessing bikeshares, here are some ideas policymakers should consider.\n1. Promote transparent decisionmaking and access to data.\nCapital Bikeshare conducts a user survey every two years that reveals user demographics but doesn\u2019t share individual-level trip data, making it hard to analyze trip patterns by different types of users.\nGPS data, also not included in the survey, could show whether certain neighborhoods are attracting trips by revealing routes and speeds through different neighborhoods. More nuanced data should be collected to boost understanding of how people use bikeshare service.\nClarity in the decisionmaking process for future stations could also be a major step toward involving the community and ensuring equitable growth.\nAllowing people to vote online for future stations is a good start, but it doesn\u2019t ensure equitable development. Communities that need stations and better overall transportation access often also lack internet access and the ability to weigh in on how new infrastructure is built.\nLike New York and Chicago, DC does not specify how stations are selected based on input from locals, so a thorough community engagement plan is crucial for equitable decisionmaking. (Capital Bikeshare is a public-private partnership venture, and DC\u2019s Department of Planning is actively involved in the planning process. View its development plan here.)\n2. Develop infrastructure equitably.\nHistoric disinvestment certainly contributed to the lack of bikeshare use by people of color in low-income neighborhoods. Lack of designated bike lanes in Wards 7 and 8 could also deter people from biking around their neighborhoods.\nIf public infrastructure like roads, bike lanes, bus stops, and train stations are not evenly developed, Capital Bikeshare will likely only reinforce the existing divides of poverty and economic opportunity.\n3. Ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities.\nUnderbanked communities also face barriers to accessing bikeshare service. Capital Bikeshare does not provide cash payment options at docks, so users must sign up for memberships online or pay with credit card and make a $100 deposit. Lacking a credit card or a smartphone could be a barrier for some DC residents seeking to integrate bikeshare service into their travel.\nCapital Bikeshare already offers financial assistance programs like cash payment options and heavily discounted memberships, but it\u2019s unclear if communities in need are aware of these programs, and data on their success aren\u2019t available.\nPhiladelphia adopted an innovative program to remove these financial barriers that showed promising results. Communities in the city also had bikeshare ambassadors to promote bikeshare use in underserved areas. In Boston, doctors are \u201cprescribing\u201d heavily subsidized bikeshare memberships to people in communities where bikeshare memberships are unaffordable but whose health could benefit the most from greater use.\nDC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with more than 30 community groups to offer need-based $5 annual membership. Such programs are promising for serving disadvantaged communities in DC, but better understanding of the demographics of bikeshare users and barriers to to the uptake of reduced-price memberships could help improve outcomes. In an upcoming blog post, we analyze trip destinations and different diversity measures to gather a picture of travel patterns in DC.\nContinue the conversation about urbanism in the Washington region and support GGWash\u2019s news and advocacy when you\u00a0join the GGWash Neighborhood!\nYipeng Su is a research analyst in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

DART faces uncertain future as North Texas cities try to cut funding\nCity officials say poor service and a lack of transparency underlie recent votes to cap funding to the agency. \nBy Amber GaudetTransportation and mobility reporter\nTransportation and mobility reporter\n6:00 AM on Aug 9, 2024 CDT\nDallas Area Rapid Transit, the region\u2019s largest mass transit agency ferrying nearly 50 million passengers last year, could lose $6 billion in funding during the next two decades if cities that pay the bulk of its budget get their wish.\nSix of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June in support of cutting sales tax contributions to the transit agency by a quarter. Another member city, Dallas, has discussed doing the same.\nSince DART was formed in 1983, participating cities have paid a penny sales tax \u2014 a 1% tax on every dollar spent \u2014 to DART. Sales tax revenue represents about 70% of the transit agency\u2019s overall budget. Other revenue sources include fares, federal funds, interest and debt issuances. Plano and Irving, two of DART\u2019s biggest sources of sales tax revenue, would each save about $30 million annually by cutting contributions by a quarter.\nDART leaders have said that would cripple the agency, leading to deep service cuts throughout the region. Member cities, however, say they\u2019ve waited years to get answers from DART about where their dollars are going \u2014 and are ready to take the fight over funding to the Texas Legislature to change the laws governing regional transit agencies.\nGet the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.\nOr with: \nBy signing up you agree to our\u00a0Terms of Service\u00a0and\u00a0Privacy Policy\nDART\u2019s system services about 700 square miles in Dallas-Fort Worth, operating 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country. The urban rail and bus network is the primary source of transportation for thousands of area residents traversing the sprawling metroplex. The usefulness and scope of that system is now in question by cities looking to claw back millions of dollars in contributions, which have grown to $870 million a year.\nHow DART was formed and funded\nIn August 1983, voters in 14 cities in Dallas-Fort Worth cast ballots in favor of forming a regional transportation authority that collected a 1-cent sales tax from member cities. Seven suburban cities voted against the proposal.\nThat support led to the creation of DART. It was the second attempt to form a regional transit authority supported by a 1-cent sales tax.\nAs early as 1988, according to The Dallas Morning News archives, some local officials and residents were expressing doubts about the newly formed DART, complaining of poor system design, excessive costs and mismanaged funds.\nIt\u2019s long been common for transportation agencies to be the subject of poor public opinion, according to Michael Walk, a researcher at the Texas A&M Transportation Institute.\n\u201cThe norm for transit systems, particularly across the U.S., is to struggle with public perception, whether it\u2019s the riders themselves being maybe dissatisfied with the way the routes work or with safety or cleanliness of systems or nonriders seeing public transit as a less desirable service,\u201d Walk said. \u201cSo I think it\u2019s an ongoing challenge to correct those perceptions or to mitigate the ramifications of them.\u201d\nThe state\u2019s Transportation Code gives transportation agency boards the authority to voluntarily ask the state comptroller to collect sales taxes at a lower rate than what the public authorized when DART was formed. If the DART Board of Directors does not do that on its own as member cities that have passed resolutions want, officials would be forced to ask the legislature to change the code to create another avenue to cut funding.\nAs cities demand answers, riders fear cuts\nWhen Dallas resident Alexander Dunn heard Plano passed a resolution in June to cut their contributions to DART, he started organizing. On a Saturday afternoon in late July, Dunn and about 50 other DART riders and advocates gathered in a small community room in downtown Dallas to discuss how to respond.\n\u201cPeople are really keyed into the fact that this is an existential fight for the future of DART,\u201d Dunn said.\nDunn\u2019s group, Dallas Area Transit Alliance, says riders will ultimately pay the price for funding reductions. Although he\u2019s a casual user of DART who owns a car, he knows many rely on the system as their sole source of transportation.\nAlthough exactly what cuts would happen would be determined if funding reductions were finalized, they could include less frequent buses, cuts to paratransit service for disabled riders, workforce reductions and deferred maintenance.\n\u201cMany options from my personal perspective exist including consolidation of bus routes, increased schedule intervals for buses, light rail and commuter rail, as well as the reduction up to removal of GoLink service,\u201d DART board member Randall Bryant said in a public statement. Bryant represents Dallas on the board.\nThe alliance launched an online petition objecting to the cuts that has collected more than 1,400 signatures as of Aug. 6.\n\u201cAll of the progress DART\u2019s been making over the past year, more than a year, with regards to security, cleanliness, maintenance, reliability, frequency \u2014 all of that would go away if DART loses a quarter of its sales tax revenue,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd even beyond that, we now have to be starting to work from the bottom trying to get back to that [current service levels] before we can even think about improvements.\u201d\nOfficials say they empathize with riders and are advocating to make the system they rely on better.\n\u201cPlano is very pro-transit \u2014 I think that gets lost in some of the discussions and media surrounding the discussion,\u201d said Plano director of government relations Andrew Fortune. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion around, \u2018Oh, my goodness, this is going to harm riders or it\u2019s going to cut services\u2019 and that\u2019s really not the proposal.\u2019\u201d\nRowlett Mayor Blake Margolis said he understands riders\u2019 concerns and does not want to see service in his city reduced.\n\u201cWe support transit,\u201d Margolis said. \u201cWe want to see DART perform well, we want to see trains be clean and safe, and we want to see ridership go up. But we also know that just the way that the business is functioning today is not working in the best interest of DART member cities.\n\u201cAnd if we want to see this transit system grow regionally, then  something of some kind needs to change with this structure.\u201d\n\u2018Rendering the entire system useless\u2019\nLeaders at the mass transit agency say reduced contributions would mean significant cuts to the frequency and number of critical routes. Service frequency could be cut back from 15 minutes to as much as one hour on some routes, and paratransit services for disabled residents would also be cut back to federally mandated minimums, DART CEO Nadine Lee said.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re getting to those levels of service on your best lines, best corridors, you\u2019re really rendering the entire system useless,\u201d Lee said.\nThe agency would also have to halt or delay maintenance and modernization projects. Those include efforts to upgrade original rail signal systems, infrastructure and vehicles and to modernize passenger amenities and facilities.\n\u201cBoth the light rail fleet as well as the bus fleet is ending its useful life or reaching the end of its useful life,\u201d Lee said.\n\u201cWe know that we need to program a tremendous amount of money to modernize our system because it is aging and because it is becoming increasingly more expensive for us to maintain what we have because of the age of our assets. And so the spending that we\u2019re doing is prudent.\u201d\nThe agency hopes to expand services as the region contends with a growing population.\nGrowing contributions means more accountability\nSeveral member cities that have publicly supported capping DART contributions have said they do not want service cuts and the recent resolutions were an attempt to get answers from the agency. Top officials from three member cities said they have been asking DART for years to provide a detailed breakdown of what services the cities get for their dollars, along with local ridership numbers.\n\u201cWe continue to look at how much revenue is increasing year over year, and still can\u2019t get an accounting of what it costs to provide services in Plano, so that really became a driving aspect,\u201d Plano City Manager Mark Israelson said. \u201cI think Plano has been very patient in waiting for some of those answers over these years, and we\u2019re at that point of really wanting to know what that provides to our community.\u201d\nThe agency provided a cost allocation report by city in 2022, DART chief financial officer Jamie Adelman said.\n\u201cThere were three or four attempts that we made to try to allocate the cost by city in order to answer the question that we were hearing from the cities, and I will tell you that every time we turned something in to the cities for their review, they were not happy with it, [but] they were not clear about what they weren\u2019t happy with,\u201d DART CEO Lee said.\nFiguring out how to break down systemwide costs like light rail by city has remained a challenge, according to Lee.\nDART has commissioned a study examining the return on investment for each city by Ernst & Young, results of which are expected in September.\nAlso expected in the fall is the Transit 2.0 report, a study commissioned by the North Central Texas Council of Governments to examine regional transportation needs, including DART funding, through 2050. Lee and North Central Texas Council of Governments Regional Transportation Council director Michael Morris have separately urged cities to wait for the results of the studies before taking action.\n\u201cThe resolutions that the cities are taking are premature and the reason why they\u2019re premature is we\u2019ve already outlined the process to get their questions answered,\u201d Morris said.\nAmong other top issues for member cities is service. Officials from cities voting to cut funding have said they regularly hear complaints from residents about poor system design, crime and unclean buses and trains. Meanwhile, the dollar amount of tax contributions by member cities to DART has grown for the past 10 years and is expected to increase about 4.5% in fiscal year 2025.\n\u201cWhat would have the most impact positively toward their ridership is to enhance their basic services, making sure their trains and busses are clean, making sure that there\u2019s proper fare enforcement, making sure that people feel safe while riding public transportation, which has been a plague on the system and which my constituents tell me is the reason why they don\u2019t feel safe riding the train anymore,\u201d Rowlett\u2019s Margolis said. \u201cThis is about saying, \u2018Hey, wake up, let\u2019s refocus back on the important things that DART needs to focus on and get right.\u2019\u201d\nNot all member cities think DART is doing a bad job. Officials in Garland and Richardson have expressed support for DART in public meetings, though none have taken formal action in support of the agency.\nDART said they have tried to engage with city leaders about how to meet the needs of each community, but often haven\u2019t gotten clear answers on what those needs are. Some member cities haven\u2019t engaged at all, staff said during a committee meeting earlier this month, though the agency keeps trying.\nDART, cities face revenue pressures\nMember cities have pointed to low ridership as a reason to cut funds. DART says ridership has recovered about 83% since the COVID-19 pandemic, ahead of the national average, though they did not specify what metrics they use for the figure. Online ridership data shows fiscal year-to-date ridership through June 2024 is at 41.4 million compared to 52.8 million in June 2019, about 22% lower than during the pre-pandemic measure. DART\u2019s fiscal year runs October through September.\n\u201cWe spend ... this year the projections are $108 million \u2014 that\u2019s more money than we spend on anything,\u201d Irving Mayor and DART board member Rick Stopfer said. \u201cAnd what are our residents getting for it? Are they really getting the service that $100 million deserves?\u201d\nBoard member Patrick Kennedy, who represents Dallas, said cities should be looking to increase density around stations to encourage ridership.\n\u201cLike 80% of where ridership comes from is the built environment and land use patterns,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe should be going pedal to the metal for the next 10 years doing that rather than trying to take away revenue.\u201d\nLike other organizations, transit agencies have been subject to inflationary pressures that have squeezed finances, according to transportation researcher Walk.\n\u201cIn addition to just general inflation and labor costs increases, it\u2019s been a very big challenge to keep the workforce and to then have to pay them what they need in order to stay in a very difficult job,\u201d Walk said. \u201cJust like the rest of the industry, and every person is experiencing, whether it\u2019s parts or fuel, or supplies, professional services, everything has been going up recently, and so transit agencies feel those pressures, just like every other business and company.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not to say every transit agency is 100% efficient, Walk said. There are significant maintenance and operational costs to running a large transit system that might be difficult to communicate in a direct service-for-dollars way that cities desire. Those cost pressures can get in the way of investing in service upgrades like frequency increases.\nCity leaders from Rowlett, Plano and Irving have complained the DART system is a magnet for crime and the service is losing money because residents with other options are choosing not to ride DART.\nDART crime reports increased 18% for the second quarter of 2024 over the same time last year. DART says that is because of increased efforts to be proactive in addressing issues. The agency has added more than 100 armed security officers to address crime and partnered with Parkland Health for homeless and mental health outreach.\nMargolis has pointed to fare evasion as an area where DART could shore up funds. Fares generally make up a small percentage of overall revenue, and things like day passes and federally mandated discount fares for certain groups complicate the fare picture, Lee said.\nThe agency had 73 fare enforcement officers last year. Increasing enforcement through a wider deployment of officers would result in more costs than returns, according to Lee.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a perception that we\u2019re missing out on a significant amount of fares, and I don\u2019t think that that is accurate,\u201d Lee said.\nDART has said cutting funding would only introduce more issues into the system.\n\u201cThat means now you don\u2019t have money to do the repairs on a 40-year-old system that needs to be done to keep the system up to date, and you keep making the entire system worse and worse,\u201d DART spokesperson Jeamy Molina said in July.\nLooking to Austin for answers\nAny reduction to the 1-cent tax could potentially put DART in default with bondholders, staff told the board during a committee meeting earlier this month. About 25% of what DART spends every year is on debt service.\nMember cities say they are dealing with their own budget constraints. Dallas has discussed whether to divert DART funds to deal with its pension crisis, though only the DART board or the Texas Legislature can trigger changes to DART\u2019s funding structure. Officials have pointed to a 2019 state law that capped local government property tax increases at 3.5% without voter approval.\n\u201cWe had that implemented, and we had to adjust very quickly,\u201d Plano\u2019s Israelson said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an extended period to be able to do that. So we\u2019ve learned to live with revenue caps. We think DART can, too.\u201d\nIsraelson said the goal is to lower the city\u2019s sales tax contribution to .75 cents per dollar. A revenue cap could also have incremental growth baked in to account for inflation.\n\u201cRight now, we would challenge the discussion that if they are fully funded at the dollar amount that they have this year and going forward they have a revenue cap that has some sort of increment of growth in it, I would challenge the question, tell us how that\u2019s a service reduction versus the current service level,\u201d Israelson said.\nPlano and Irving send more than $100 million a year to DART. The $30 million or more that would be saved under their funding cut requests could provide relief to city budgets struggling to pay for other services.\nIsraelson said it would be up to Plano voters how those dollars are spent. In Irving, Stopfer said he would keep that money focused on getting residents where they need to go \u2014 though he isn\u2019t sure what that might look like. Bus stops, sidewalks and streets all need attention in Irving\u2019s DART service areas, he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of dollars that need to be spent so that the individuals that are using these buses  are in a clean, safe, accessible environment,\u201d Stopfer said.\nWith the DART board not expected to offer a resolution to reduce funding, cities are weighing their options ahead of the next legislative session.\n\u201cIf we really want to deal with these issues, it\u2019s going to require legislation,\u201d Stopfer said.\nA proposal being considered by Plano officials would amend the Texas Transportation Code to restrict the issuance of future debt pledges to 3/4 a cent of tax revenue and \u201cimmediately\u201d institute a revenue cap equivalent to DART\u2019s sales tax projections for fiscal year 2024. An annual 2% growth index from sales tax revenue would be allowed for one-time expenditures, with any growth above 2% dedicated to paying off debt faster.\nThe proposal is a starting place for discussions and is the result of a consensus among member cities that passed resolutions supporting DART revenue caps, according to Plano\u2019s Fortune.\nMost of the items in Plano\u2019s proposal can be accomplished by the DART board without legislative action, which Plano officials still hope for, Fortune said. But if DART doesn\u2019t come to the table, officials will take the fight to Austin.\nPlano will likely finalize its legislative program in October.\nStopfer said he would like to see legislative action to allow cities to join DART for less than a full penny and to allow funds in excess of a capped amount to be returned to member cities.\n\u201cI think that there\u2019s got to be a certain amount of transparency on how the dollars are spent, [and] I think that there\u2019s got to be some correlation between ridership and dollars spent,\u201d Stopfer said. \u201cI think that if you\u2019re truly going to bring other people on board, in addition to lowering the percentage, you\u2019re going to have to change the makeup of the board because no one is going to come on a board that they can\u2019t have a voice on.\u201d\nBoard members are appointed based on a member city\u2019s population, giving Dallas eight representatives on the board. Other cities have at most two each.\nRowlett is also thinking about contingencies, according to Margolis, though he said it was too early to share specifics.\n\u201cConversations are happening more and more between a coalition of member cities \u2014 we\u2019re working on our next steps and formulating that and getting ready,\u201d Margolis said.\nDART is considering its own legislative priorities. The board recently postponed a vote to finalize a legislative agenda that included language opposing \u201clegislation that could detrimentally impact DART\u2019s mission, finances, governance or operations, including changes to DART\u2019s sales tax statute.\u201d\nThe board will revisit the issue in September.\nDART wants to keep talks about how to move transit forward local, Lee said, and continue discussions with member cities about how to meet the unique needs of each area through its area planning process.\n\u201cWe have had conversations with each individual city about their vision for the future,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to accomplish in the future, where they see development patterns happening, where they see their major travel corridors where we can add that travel capacity for them. How we incorporate transit as more of an essential piece of the fabric of their cities.\n\u201cThose are the conversations I want to be having instead of trying to fight something down in Austin.\u201d\nAmber is a staff writer for The Dallas Morning News.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Bikesharing has gained popularity in US cities due to concerns about health, congestion, and climate change. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America, Capital Bikeshare. Despite its success, the distribution and usage of bikeshare stations in Washington D.C. reveal significant disparities. The DC Department of Transportation considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, using online crowdsourcing for station placement. However, data shows that bikeshare station placement and usage are not equitable. Stations are more densely located in areas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment. About 67% of bikeshare stations are within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop. Stations near Metro stations generate 82% of trips. In 2017, a station at Union Station saw 60,371 member rides, while a station near Capitol Heights generated only 51 rides. The most popular stations are in high-income neighborhoods with low unemployment rates and more college-educated residents. Wards 7 and 8, predominantly black areas east of the Anacostia River, have only 10% of DC\u2019s stations but generated just 0.5% of total trips in 2017. To address these disparities, policymakers should promote transparent decision-making, develop infrastructure equitably, and ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities. Capital Bikeshare offers financial assistance programs, but awareness and data on their success are limited. Innovative programs in other cities, like Philadelphia and Boston, show promising results in removing financial barriers and promoting bikeshare use in underserved areas. DC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with community groups to offer need-based $5 annual memberships, but better understanding of user demographics and barriers is needed to improve outcomes.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), the largest mass transit agency in North Texas, is facing potential funding cuts that could total $6 billion over the next two decades. Six of DART\u2019s 13 member cities have passed resolutions since June 2024 to reduce their sales tax contributions by a quarter, with Dallas also considering similar measures. This sales tax, a 1% levy on every dollar spent, constitutes about 70% of DART\u2019s budget. Plano and Irving, two major contributors, would each save about $30 million annually with the proposed cuts.DART, which services 700 square miles in the Dallas-Fort Worth area with 692 buses and one of the longest light rail systems in the country, argues that these cuts would severely impact service, including less frequent buses, reduced paratransit services, workforce reductions, and deferred maintenance. The agency's ridership has recovered to about 83% of pre-pandemic levels, with fiscal year-to-date ridership at 41.4 million through June 2024, compared to 52.8 million in June 2019.The funding cuts are driven by member cities' demands for greater transparency and accountability from DART. Cities like Plano and Irving have been asking for detailed breakdowns of services and local ridership numbers for years. DART has attempted to provide cost allocation reports, but cities have found them unsatisfactory. A study by Ernst & Young on the return on investment for each city is expected in September 2024, along with the Transit 2.0 report examining regional transportation needs through 2050.Riders and advocates, like the Dallas Area Transit Alliance, fear that funding reductions will lead to significant service cuts, affecting thousands who rely on DART as their primary mode of transportation. An online petition against the cuts has garnered over 1,400 signatures.City officials argue that the current system is inefficient and plagued by issues such as crime, poor design, and uncleanliness. They believe that reducing contributions will force DART to improve its services. However, DART officials warn that such cuts would only exacerbate existing problems, making it harder to maintain and modernize the aging system.The debate over DART\u2019s funding is expected to continue, with cities potentially taking their case to the Texas Legislature. Proposals include amending the Texas Transportation Code to cap future debt pledges and institute a revenue cap. DART, on the other hand, aims to keep discussions local and work with member cities to address their unique needs.In summary, the implementation of the new light rail line in Dallas in June 2024 has been overshadowed by the broader issue of funding cuts and their potential impact on public transportation usage. While the new line may have contributed to the 83% recovery in ridership, the looming financial challenges and service reductions pose significant risks to the future of DART and its ability to serve the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.",

July 6, 1990\nWhen it comes to transportation in San Francisco, the cable cars and streetcars understandably get all the glory. But the bus has played an important role in San Francisco's history too. There's a folder in the photo archives devoted to San Francisco buses. The earliest one dates from 1918, showing the first gasoline bus introduced by The San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency. It crossed Golden Gate Park. There aren't any bus photos in the folder from the Twenties or Thirties, I had to get them from another source. But, every other decade was well represented.\u00a0\nThe photo from 1918 was used in an article that was published in 1962. Fifty years earlier, San Francisco launched as what Muni describes as \"the first major, publicly owned, land-based transit agency in the United States.\" On that day, an open end streetcar, which came to be known as \"Old Number One,\" slid smoothly and sleekly out of the barn and headed east down Geary Street at noon, on December 28.\"\u00a0\nMore For You\nRare unseen downtown San Francisco photos show city life in the 1930s and 1940s\nSave the Palace of Fine Arts?

Today, that same ride will cost adults $2.25. In 1912, San Francisco's mayor, \"Sunny Jim\" Rolph, placed the first nickel in Muni's first coin box. The Chronicle article at the time stated that the coin was one of the first 40 minted at the Old Mint at Fifth and Mission Streets.\u00a0\nMayor Rolph hoped the launching of the transit system would be without much fanfare. But, by the time the streetcar reached Market Street, just off Geary, it was met by a mob of about 50,000 people, almost causing a riot. Souvenir hunters placed coins on the tracks to flatten them. In the first 12 hours, fifteen thousand people jammed onto the 10 new streetcars, earning Muni a handsome $750.\u00a0\nThe video below shows what Market Street was like in 1912, just prior to the Muni's founding.\nBob Bragman is a producer for SFGATE.

    "Document2": "Three ways bikeshare can be more equitable in\u00a0DC\nBicyclingBy Yipeng Su (Urban Institute),\u00a0Robin Wang (Urban Institute) February 15, 2019\u00a021\n CaBi in Petworth by Bekah Richards licensed under Creative Commons.\nThis article was first published by the Urban Institute on February 11, 2019.\nBikesharing has gained popularity in US cities as concerns about health, congestion, and climate change have increased. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America. Since then, Capital Bikeshare users have generated millions of rides, but use and station placement varies around the city.\nThe DC Department of Transportation clearly considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, and the department used online crowdsourcing to allow residents to vote on new station placement. But is bikesharing reinforcing DC\u2019s existing disparities, or is it effectively acting to reverse them?\nTo answer this question, we need data. Unlike many privately owned, dockless bike or scooter sharing services, Capital Bikeshare makes anonymized ridership data available online. We focused our analysis only on registered members (who account for three-quarters of the total trips in DC, compared with casual nonmember users) because these riders are more likely to be local residents. View our methodology (PDF) here.\nWith funding support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we took a closer look at Capital Bikeshare\u2019s potential to address the city\u2019s racial and economic disparities. We placed the 2017 data in the context of DC\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics to identify challenges and opportunities for developing bikeshare equitably. Our analysis revealed two primary challenges.\n1. Station placement isn\u2019t equitable and follows patterns of existing infrastructure.\nDC has 276 Capital Bikeshare stations, distributed in 118 of 179 census tracts (66% of tracts in DC). The density of bikeshare stations varies across neighborhoods. Census tracts with the most stations are generally near popular destinations for tourists and residents, like the National Mall.\nAreas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment tend to have more stations available. On average, tracts in the top quartile in terms of share of white population and income level have more than twice the amount of bike share stations available, compared to tracts in the bottom quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBikeshare station placement generally follows existing transportation infrastructure, such as Metro and Metrobus stations. About 67% of bikeshare stations are located within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% of bikeshare stations are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop.\nRiders also seem to appreciate stations that are closer to a Metro station. Bike stations within a half mile of a Metro station (185 stations) generate 82% of trips, on average.\n2. Station use differs by neighborhood.\nA single bikeshare station at Union Station saw an impressive 60,371 member rides in 2017, but another station near Capitol Heights (61st Street and Banks PIace NE) generated only 51 member rides.\nThe most popular centers during noncommute hours are concentrated in neighborhoods that have low unemployment rates, high income levels, more people with a college degree, and fewer people of color. This trend is consistent with findings from a 2016 survey (PDF) that found 80% of bikeshare members are white.\nUse is clustered in high-income neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes:\u00a0Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nSuch racial disparity is also reflected by the east-west divide made by the Anacostia River. We grouped DC stations by east and west of the river and looked at bikeshare stations and use, and the equity gap is huge. Wards 7 and 8 (east of the Anacostia river), which are predominately black, accounted for 10% of DC\u2019s total stations, but they generated only 0.5% of the total trips in 2017. While 37% of the trips generated from east of the Anacostia ended up across the river, only 0.1% of trips generated from west of the river ended up east of the Anacostia.\nUse is clustered in less diverse neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes: Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nThese data suggest that people lack incentive to use bikeshare services in these neighborhoods, even when stations are available. The five stations that members used the least in 2017 are all stations added to Wards 7 and 8 toward the end of the year as part of the mayor\u2019s effort to expand DC\u2019s bike network. But even excluding these stations, four of the five least-used stations are still east of the Anacostia.\nHow can the city use bikeshare service to support its equity goals?\nBikeshare service could improve mobility and connectivity across DC\u2019s racial and socioeconomic boundaries. But our analysis shows that people don\u2019t use bikeshares more just because they are available, raising perhaps the most important question for planners and decisionmakers: what provides incentive for communities to use bikeshares, and what are the barriers diminishing the incentives for certain communities?\nDrawing from best practices and studies on potential barriers for accessing bikeshares, here are some ideas policymakers should consider.\n1. Promote transparent decisionmaking and access to data.\nCapital Bikeshare conducts a user survey every two years that reveals user demographics but doesn\u2019t share individual-level trip data, making it hard to analyze trip patterns by different types of users.\nGPS data, also not included in the survey, could show whether certain neighborhoods are attracting trips by revealing routes and speeds through different neighborhoods. More nuanced data should be collected to boost understanding of how people use bikeshare service.\nClarity in the decisionmaking process for future stations could also be a major step toward involving the community and ensuring equitable growth.\nAllowing people to vote online for future stations is a good start, but it doesn\u2019t ensure equitable development. Communities that need stations and better overall transportation access often also lack internet access and the ability to weigh in on how new infrastructure is built.\nLike New York and Chicago, DC does not specify how stations are selected based on input from locals, so a thorough community engagement plan is crucial for equitable decisionmaking. (Capital Bikeshare is a public-private partnership venture, and DC\u2019s Department of Planning is actively involved in the planning process. View its development plan here.)\n2. Develop infrastructure equitably.\nHistoric disinvestment certainly contributed to the lack of bikeshare use by people of color in low-income neighborhoods. Lack of designated bike lanes in Wards 7 and 8 could also deter people from biking around their neighborhoods.\nIf public infrastructure like roads, bike lanes, bus stops, and train stations are not evenly developed, Capital Bikeshare will likely only reinforce the existing divides of poverty and economic opportunity.\n3. Ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities.\nUnderbanked communities also face barriers to accessing bikeshare service. Capital Bikeshare does not provide cash payment options at docks, so users must sign up for memberships online or pay with credit card and make a $100 deposit. Lacking a credit card or a smartphone could be a barrier for some DC residents seeking to integrate bikeshare service into their travel.\nCapital Bikeshare already offers financial assistance programs like cash payment options and heavily discounted memberships, but it\u2019s unclear if communities in need are aware of these programs, and data on their success aren\u2019t available.\nPhiladelphia adopted an innovative program to remove these financial barriers that showed promising results. Communities in the city also had bikeshare ambassadors to promote bikeshare use in underserved areas. In Boston, doctors are \u201cprescribing\u201d heavily subsidized bikeshare memberships to people in communities where bikeshare memberships are unaffordable but whose health could benefit the most from greater use.\nDC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with more than 30 community groups to offer need-based $5 annual membership. Such programs are promising for serving disadvantaged communities in DC, but better understanding of the demographics of bikeshare users and barriers to to the uptake of reduced-price memberships could help improve outcomes. In an upcoming blog post, we analyze trip destinations and different diversity measures to gather a picture of travel patterns in DC.\nContinue the conversation about urbanism in the Washington region and support GGWash\u2019s news and advocacy when you\u00a0join the GGWash Neighborhood!\nYipeng Su is a research analyst in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

    "Document1": "Subway and bus ridership for 2023\n2023 ridership reflects continued growth\nIn 2023, subway ridership posted a 14% annual increase to 1.15 billion annual paid rides, hitting the billion-ride milestone six weeks earlier than in 2022.\nRidership patterns have shifted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, with discretionary travel becoming more popular than commutation travel. Increased telecommuting and more flexible work-from-home policies have made traditional five-day commuting less common. Commutation ridership is now highest on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Overall subway ridership is now at 68% of 2019 levels. At 77%, weekend recovery is higher than the weekday recovery of 66%. Paid ridership has also benefited from a slightly lower fare evasion rate in 2023, as the MTA continues to combat subway fare evasion.\nBus ridership experienced a modest annual increase of 0.3% to 426 million rides, 63% of the 2019 level. This was slower than the 11% growth observed in 2022. Significant factors contributing to slower growth include rising bus fare evasion and the introduction of a fare-free pilot program on five bus routes starting in September 2023.\nOverview of New York City\u2019s transit system\nWe operate the largest public transportation agency in North America and one of the largest in the world.\nThe subway has a daily ridership of approximately 3.6 million and buses have a daily ridership of 1.4 million, representing 68% and 63%, respectively, of pre-pandemic ridership levels.\nOur system includes:\nHow we calculate ridership\nSubways\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nBuses\nWe include:\nWe do not include:\nAverage weekday, Saturday, and Sunday ridership includes every weekday, Saturday, and Sunday in the year, except major holidays and days when the subway system was closed or operated fare-free.\nAverage weekend ridership is the two-day sum of average Saturday plus average Sunday ridership.

Note that our table lists 424 stations. We combined ridership data for station complexes, where stations are connected by transfer passageways. (We can't accurately allocate ridership to each station in a complex.) For example, the 14 St\u00a0\u200b\u200b\u200b\u00a0station is combined with the 8 Av\u00a0\u200b\u00a0station.\nThe station names and lines stopping at each station reflect service at the end of 2023.\nIn our spreadsheet, stations are listed alphabetically by borough, and the rankings are by 2023 ridership. The \u201csystemwide adjustment\u201d accounts for miscellaneous ridership and other adjustments that are not allocated by station.\nIn our tables, stations that were temporarily closed (either fully or partially) are denoted with asterisks; go to the \u201cClosures\u201d tab for the closure dates. For these stations, zero ridership was included in the averages for any days when the station was closed, except for the days when the entire subway was closed or fare-free.\nSummary of bus ridership (New York City Transit)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n1,811,605\n1,122,626\n868,057\n1,990,683\n569,361,220\n2019\n1,770,394\n1,108,809\n847,931\n1,956,740\n557,036,504\n2020\n980,374\n671,835\n532,002\n1,203,837\n316,768,454\n2021\n984,865\n646,302\n482,090\n1,128,392\n311,893,583\n2022\n1,094,415\n662,179\n523,178\n1,185,357\n343,092,963\n2023\n1,082,428\n670,755\n535,911\n1,206,666\n340,766,398\nSummary of bus ridership (MTA Bus Company)\nYear\nAverage weekday\nAverage Saturday\nAverage Sunday\nAverage weekend\nAnnual total\n2018\n392,617\n224,751\n170,892\n395,643\n121,448,276\n2019\n388,075\n228,364\n171,762\n400,126\n120,551,580\n2020\n207,042\n132,387\n99,713\n232,100\n65,655,990\n2021\n228,425\n142,112\n102,744\n244,856\n71,431,466\n2022\n268,124\n150,399\n113,157\n263,556\n82,609,386\n2023\n279,247\n159,451\n121,069\n280,520\n86,216,666\nTop 10 busiest bus routes by ridership in 2023\nRank\nRoute\nBorough\nRidership\n1\nM15 Local/SBS\nManhattan\n10,468,682\n2\nQ58\nQueens\n7,119,884\n3\nB6\nBrooklyn\n6,049,383\n4\nBx12 Local/SBS\nBronx\n5,900,063\n5\nB82 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,647,706\n6\nB46 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,547,520\n7\nB44 Local/SBS\nBrooklyn\n5,468,965\n8\nQ27\nQueens\n5,414,302\n9\nB41\nBrooklyn\n4,759,664\n10\nQ44\nQueens\n4,715,292\nAbout our bus data\nLocal routes begin with one or two letters corresponding to the major borough of operation (B = Brooklyn, Bx = Bronx, M = Manhattan, Q = Queens, S = Staten Island).

    "Document2": "Three ways bikeshare can be more equitable in\u00a0DC\nBicyclingBy Yipeng Su (Urban Institute),\u00a0Robin Wang (Urban Institute) February 15, 2019\u00a021\n CaBi in Petworth by Bekah Richards licensed under Creative Commons.\nThis article was first published by the Urban Institute on February 11, 2019.\nBikesharing has gained popularity in US cities as concerns about health, congestion, and climate change have increased. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America. Since then, Capital Bikeshare users have generated millions of rides, but use and station placement varies around the city.\nThe DC Department of Transportation clearly considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, and the department used online crowdsourcing to allow residents to vote on new station placement. But is bikesharing reinforcing DC\u2019s existing disparities, or is it effectively acting to reverse them?\nTo answer this question, we need data. Unlike many privately owned, dockless bike or scooter sharing services, Capital Bikeshare makes anonymized ridership data available online. We focused our analysis only on registered members (who account for three-quarters of the total trips in DC, compared with casual nonmember users) because these riders are more likely to be local residents. View our methodology (PDF) here.\nWith funding support from the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, we took a closer look at Capital Bikeshare\u2019s potential to address the city\u2019s racial and economic disparities. We placed the 2017 data in the context of DC\u2019s socioeconomic characteristics to identify challenges and opportunities for developing bikeshare equitably. Our analysis revealed two primary challenges.\n1. Station placement isn\u2019t equitable and follows patterns of existing infrastructure.\nDC has 276 Capital Bikeshare stations, distributed in 118 of 179 census tracts (66% of tracts in DC). The density of bikeshare stations varies across neighborhoods. Census tracts with the most stations are generally near popular destinations for tourists and residents, like the National Mall.\nAreas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment tend to have more stations available. On average, tracts in the top quartile in terms of share of white population and income level have more than twice the amount of bike share stations available, compared to tracts in the bottom quartile\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nBikeshare station placement generally follows existing transportation infrastructure, such as Metro and Metrobus stations. About 67% of bikeshare stations are located within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% of bikeshare stations are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop.\nRiders also seem to appreciate stations that are closer to a Metro station. Bike stations within a half mile of a Metro station (185 stations) generate 82% of trips, on average.\n2. Station use differs by neighborhood.\nA single bikeshare station at Union Station saw an impressive 60,371 member rides in 2017, but another station near Capitol Heights (61st Street and Banks PIace NE) generated only 51 member rides.\nThe most popular centers during noncommute hours are concentrated in neighborhoods that have low unemployment rates, high income levels, more people with a college degree, and fewer people of color. This trend is consistent with findings from a 2016 survey (PDF) that found 80% of bikeshare members are white.\nUse is clustered in high-income neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes:\u00a0Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nSuch racial disparity is also reflected by the east-west divide made by the Anacostia River. We grouped DC stations by east and west of the river and looked at bikeshare stations and use, and the equity gap is huge. Wards 7 and 8 (east of the Anacostia river), which are predominately black, accounted for 10% of DC\u2019s total stations, but they generated only 0.5% of the total trips in 2017. While 37% of the trips generated from east of the Anacostia ended up across the river, only 0.1% of trips generated from west of the river ended up east of the Anacostia.\nUse is clustered in less diverse neighborhoods\nSource: American Community Survey five-year Estimates 2012-2016 and 2017 Capital Bikeshare Trip History Data.\u00a0Notes: Only bike share stations located in DC are kept in our analysis and maps; as a result, bike trips originating from or traveling to locations outside DC are not included. Neighborhood information for census tract 006202 (Potomac Parks and National Mall) is not presented due to very small numbers of residents living in the area. \nThese data suggest that people lack incentive to use bikeshare services in these neighborhoods, even when stations are available. The five stations that members used the least in 2017 are all stations added to Wards 7 and 8 toward the end of the year as part of the mayor\u2019s effort to expand DC\u2019s bike network. But even excluding these stations, four of the five least-used stations are still east of the Anacostia.\nHow can the city use bikeshare service to support its equity goals?\nBikeshare service could improve mobility and connectivity across DC\u2019s racial and socioeconomic boundaries. But our analysis shows that people don\u2019t use bikeshares more just because they are available, raising perhaps the most important question for planners and decisionmakers: what provides incentive for communities to use bikeshares, and what are the barriers diminishing the incentives for certain communities?\nDrawing from best practices and studies on potential barriers for accessing bikeshares, here are some ideas policymakers should consider.\n1. Promote transparent decisionmaking and access to data.\nCapital Bikeshare conducts a user survey every two years that reveals user demographics but doesn\u2019t share individual-level trip data, making it hard to analyze trip patterns by different types of users.\nGPS data, also not included in the survey, could show whether certain neighborhoods are attracting trips by revealing routes and speeds through different neighborhoods. More nuanced data should be collected to boost understanding of how people use bikeshare service.\nClarity in the decisionmaking process for future stations could also be a major step toward involving the community and ensuring equitable growth.\nAllowing people to vote online for future stations is a good start, but it doesn\u2019t ensure equitable development. Communities that need stations and better overall transportation access often also lack internet access and the ability to weigh in on how new infrastructure is built.\nLike New York and Chicago, DC does not specify how stations are selected based on input from locals, so a thorough community engagement plan is crucial for equitable decisionmaking. (Capital Bikeshare is a public-private partnership venture, and DC\u2019s Department of Planning is actively involved in the planning process. View its development plan here.)\n2. Develop infrastructure equitably.\nHistoric disinvestment certainly contributed to the lack of bikeshare use by people of color in low-income neighborhoods. Lack of designated bike lanes in Wards 7 and 8 could also deter people from biking around their neighborhoods.\nIf public infrastructure like roads, bike lanes, bus stops, and train stations are not evenly developed, Capital Bikeshare will likely only reinforce the existing divides of poverty and economic opportunity.\n3. Ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities.\nUnderbanked communities also face barriers to accessing bikeshare service. Capital Bikeshare does not provide cash payment options at docks, so users must sign up for memberships online or pay with credit card and make a $100 deposit. Lacking a credit card or a smartphone could be a barrier for some DC residents seeking to integrate bikeshare service into their travel.\nCapital Bikeshare already offers financial assistance programs like cash payment options and heavily discounted memberships, but it\u2019s unclear if communities in need are aware of these programs, and data on their success aren\u2019t available.\nPhiladelphia adopted an innovative program to remove these financial barriers that showed promising results. Communities in the city also had bikeshare ambassadors to promote bikeshare use in underserved areas. In Boston, doctors are \u201cprescribing\u201d heavily subsidized bikeshare memberships to people in communities where bikeshare memberships are unaffordable but whose health could benefit the most from greater use.\nDC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with more than 30 community groups to offer need-based $5 annual membership. Such programs are promising for serving disadvantaged communities in DC, but better understanding of the demographics of bikeshare users and barriers to to the uptake of reduced-price memberships could help improve outcomes. In an upcoming blog post, we analyze trip destinations and different diversity measures to gather a picture of travel patterns in DC.\nContinue the conversation about urbanism in the Washington region and support GGWash\u2019s news and advocacy when you\u00a0join the GGWash Neighborhood!\nYipeng Su is a research analyst in the Metropolitan Housing and Communities Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

    "Summarized_Document2": "Bikesharing has gained popularity in US cities due to concerns about health, congestion, and climate change. In 2010, the DC Department of Transportation introduced the first city-operated bikesharing system in North America, Capital Bikeshare. Despite its success, the distribution and usage of bikeshare stations in Washington D.C. reveal significant disparities. The DC Department of Transportation considers equity in its bikeshare development plan, using online crowdsourcing for station placement. However, data shows that bikeshare station placement and usage are not equitable. Stations are more densely located in areas with higher shares of white residents, lower poverty rates, higher income, and higher college attainment. About 67% of bikeshare stations are within half a mile of a Metro station, and 99% are within a half mile of a Metrobus stop. Stations near Metro stations generate 82% of trips. In 2017, a station at Union Station saw 60,371 member rides, while a station near Capitol Heights generated only 51 rides. The most popular stations are in high-income neighborhoods with low unemployment rates and more college-educated residents. Wards 7 and 8, predominantly black areas east of the Anacostia River, have only 10% of DC\u2019s stations but generated just 0.5% of total trips in 2017. To address these disparities, policymakers should promote transparent decision-making, develop infrastructure equitably, and ease barriers to access for disadvantaged communities. Capital Bikeshare offers financial assistance programs, but awareness and data on their success are limited. Innovative programs in other cities, like Philadelphia and Boston, show promising results in removing financial barriers and promoting bikeshare use in underserved areas. DC\u2019s Capital Bikeshare has partnered with community groups to offer need-based $5 annual memberships, but better understanding of user demographics and barriers is needed to improve outcomes.",

    "Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\nWhile traffic congestion plagues many cities, Los Angeles stands apart. The Texas Transportation Institute tracks congestion statistics for U.S. metropolitan areas on an annual basis, and Los Angeles routinely ranks first for both total and per-capita congestion delays. Considering the value of wasted time and fuel, TTI estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at close to $10 billion.\nThe map in Figure 1, based on 2006 Caltrans sensor data, illustrates the weekday pattern of traffic congestion on the LA freeway network. Congestion is pervasive throughout much of the county; most freeways have segments on which traffic averages less than 35 mph at least two hours per day, and many bottlenecks are congested at least four hours per day.\nFigure 1. Traffic Conditions on the LA Freeway Network\nConditions on the surface streets are not much better. The map in Figure 2, based on 2004 volume-to-capacity (V/C) estimates from SCAG, depicts the pattern of afternoon traffic congestion on the county\u2019s largest arterials. Here again it is evident that traffic congestion is broadly dispersed, yet the pattern is particularly intense between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\nFigure 2. Traffic Conditions on LA Surface Streets\nWith the recent run-up in fuel prices followed by a severe recession, total travel in Los Angeles has declined over the past two years, and congestion has correspondingly eased. Yet if past trends hold, this reprieve is likely to be fleeting. Should the region\u2019s economy and population grow in the coming decades, as some forecasts predict, the probable outcome is even more vehicle travel and in turn more intense congestion.\nControversial Solutions for a Daunting Problem\nResearchers at the RAND Corporation were asked to recommend strategies capable of reducing LA traffic within five years or less (the short timeframe rules out land-use reforms along with major infrastructure investments). The resulting report, Moving Los Angeles: Short-Term Policy Options for Improving Transportation, offers recommendations at once controversial and likely inescapable. To achieve lasting traffic relief, it will be necessary to manage the demand for travel through pricing reforms (e.g., congestion tolls) that increase the cost of driving and parking in the busiest corridors and areas during peak travel hours. Other measures\u2014better transit service, ridesharing programs, traffic signal synchronization, and the like\u2014can complement pricing, but are not on their own sufficient to stem current and projected future traffic congestion.\nFew Strategies Offer Much Promise\nJust why should this be so? Consider, first, that traffic congestion results from an imbalance between the supply of roads and peak-hour automotive travel. In fact, congestion can be viewed as a solution (though an unpleasant one) to this imbalance; when demand exceeds supply, congestion makes us wait our turn for available road space to balance the equation. Over the past several decades, the gap between supply and demand has widened considerably; population growth, economic expansion, and rising incomes have fueled the demand for more vehicle travel, while road construction has stagnated. We have therefore been relying, more and more, on congestion to resolve this imbalance.\nOne response would be to build or expand more roads to accommodate additional vehicle travel. Setting aside policy concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy security, the prospects for \u201cbuilding our way out of congestion\u201d are limited. To begin with, there simply isn\u2019t much space to build new roads in Los Angeles, particularly in the most densely developed urban areas. As shown in Figure 3, the density of the road network in the greater Los Angeles region, measured in lane miles per square mile, is already far greater than in any other large metropolitan area in the country.\nFigure 3. Road Network Density in Major Metropolitan Areas\nWe also lack the resources to engage in an extensive road building spree. In recent decades, federal and state elected officials have failed to increase fuel taxes enough to offset the effects of inflation and improved fuel economy, thus hobbling the major source of funding for road construction and repairs.\nEven if we could expand the road network, though, the benefits would be limited by a phenomenon described as \u201ctriple convergence.\u201d Congestion has been a problem for years, and many individuals deliberately alter their travel patterns to avoid severe traffic. When an investment in road capacity reduces peak-hour congestion, many will conclude that they no longer need to go out of their way to avoid congestion delays and will thus \u201cconverge\u201d on the improvement from (a) other times, (b) other routes, or (c) other modes of travel. The net effect is that the initial traffic-reduction benefits will usually not last over time. This is why we often see, for instance, that the improved traffic flow resulting from a new freeway lane does not last for more than a couple of years.\nIf supply-side remedies do not create sustainable reductions in traffic, it becomes necessary to examine ways of reducing peak-hour travel demand. Commonly employed options include improved transit service, voluntary ridesharing programs, flexible work hours, and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the congestion-reduction benefits of these strategies are likewise undermined by triple convergence. If a new subway line induces some peak-hour drivers to switch to transit, other drivers will soon converge on more freely flowing roads to take their place. Indeed, the effects of triple convergence explain why traffic congestion has grown steadily worse despite considerable state and local investment in a broad range of congestion-reduction strategies.\nOnly Pricing Strategies Promise Sustainable Reductions in Traffic Congestion\nThis brings us to the rationale for pricing strategies. Among the many possible options for reducing traffic congestion, only pricing resist the effects of triple convergence. By increasing the cost of driving or parking in the busiest areas or corridors during the busiest times of day, pricing measures manage the demand for peak-hour travel, in turn reducing congestion. Once traffic flow improves, the prices remain in place, thus deterring excessive convergence on the newly freed capacity.\nPricing strategies offer two additional benefits. First, pricing generates revenue to support needed transportation investments. And in comparison to sales taxes, a common option for raising local transportation revenue, pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups (though wealthier individuals consume more taxable goods than their less-affluent counterparts, to an even greater extent they (a) drive more, (b) are more likely to travel during peak hours, and (c) are more likely to pay peak-hour tolls rather than alter their travel choices). Second, pricing enables more efficient use of the road capacity that we already have, because roads on which traffic flows smoothly (at roughly 40 mph or higher) can carry far more vehicles per lane per hour than roads snarled in stop-and-go congestion. Paradoxically, then, we see that the introduction of pricing enables roads to accommodate more peak-hour trips. It is therefore useful to think of pricing as a means of managing peak-hour travel demand rather than reducing it.\nPricing Strategies Will Be Particularly Valuable in Los Angeles\nPricing holds promise for most major cities, but the case in Los Angeles is especially compelling. To understand why, it is necessary to consider the interactions between population density and travel behavior, factors that help to explain the severity of LA traffic.\nContrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale. Downtown Los Angeles isn't as dense as, say, Manhattan or central Chicago, but the suburbs surrounding Los Angeles are much denser than the typical suburb, leading to high aggregate density on a regional basis.\nAs population density increases, individuals tend to drive less on a per-capita basis. Trip origins and destinations are closer together, leading to shorter car trips, and in dense neighborhoods people can rely on alternatives such as walking, biking, or transit for a larger share of trips. Yet this can be overwhelmed by the fact that there are also more drivers competing for the same road space within a given area, thus intensifying traffic congestion. The net effect is that greater population density tends to exacerbate congestion\u2014think downtown Manhattan.\nLA traffic congestion is further exacerbated by the fact that Angelinos do not curtail their driving as much as one would expect in response to higher population density. Figure 4 compares per-capita vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and population density for the 14 largest metropolitan regions in the country.\nFigure 4. Population Density vs. Per-Capita VMT for the 14 Largest U.S. Metropolitan Regions\nLooking across the different regions, there is a fairly consistent relationship in which per-capita VMT declines with regional density. Los Angeles, though, bucks this trend. The only other metropolitan regions with higher per-capita VMT (Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Detroit) are all much less dense than Los Angeles. For regions in which the level of density approaches that of Los Angeles (San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York), per-capita VMT is much lower.\nIn short, we see a confluence of three density-related factors that combine to explain the severity of congestion in Los Angeles: (1) congestion is likely to rise with increased population density; (2) Los Angeles is much denser than its peers at the regional level; and (3) Los Angeles exhibits a surprisingly high level of per-capita VMT relative to its density. The third of these underscores the importance of pricing strategies as a means of managing the demand for automotive travel in Los Angeles.\nIn the end only pricing strategies promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Other measures \u2013 including improvements in alternative transportation modes \u2013 can be beneficial, but none will be nearly as effective as pricing. This recommendation will no doubt stir controversy, but pricing offers the only realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in the most traffic-choked of American metropolises.\nDr. Paul Sorensen is an operations researcher at the RAND Corporation, wherehe serves as Associate Director of the Transportation, Space, and Technology program.\nDr. Sorensen has published peer-reviewed studies in the areas of geographic information analysis, location optimization modeling, emergency response logistics, and transportation finance policy, and he also holds aU.S. patent on a methodology for forecasting the demand for ambulance services.

they do not allow region-wide comparisons.\nAnother measure that could be used to compare inter-regional conditions is VMT*PCE per lane mile of freeways, highways, or both.\nTruck Logistics\nTruck logistics in LA are \u201cimperfect\u201d/faulty.\nA geographical illustration of these logistics can be found on a map of warehousing, SCAG P&P TAC meeting of 8/11/10, \u201cGoods Movement Update\u201d, page 4.\nThe region cannot afford to build-up on the logistics.\nNew approach needs to be developed.\nFirstly, analysis of truck operations should be broken into three trip categories: (a) local/delivery trips, (b) out-of-region trips, and (c) in-transit/through trips.\nThen, one shall develop brand new logistics for the future and compare them to those currently projected.\nFinally, a realistic evaluation should be made - what can and what cannot be changed of the projected logistics.\nThe evaluation should be based on real and inclusive cost-benefit analysis.\nDifferent objectives can be set for each of truck trip category.\nFor example: for delivery trucks one may want to minimize VMT or, potentially, minimize VMT of goods transported.\nThe current trend of delivering more and more goods by super-heavy duty trucks circling the city and delivering a \u201ccase of beer\u201d per destination should be reversed.\nThe region needs more, smaller warehouses located in close distance to the customer.\nThen, smaller trucks can deliver \u201cretail\u201d orders, minimizing miles traveled.\nSpecific, more focused objectives can be set for the other categories.\nTraffic Congestion Geography\nThe freeway congestion, shown on Figure 1, indicates a radial pattern with a center in Downtown LA.\nSeveral maps that I\u2019ve saved at various hours from PeMS web network and other services including Google, Yahoo, and Sigalert since 2007, confirm the above observation.\nIn addition, one can see frequent, and apparently worsening, adverse conditions on SR-605 between SR-105 and SR-60 and on SR-91 east of SR-710.\nDuring peak periods there is substantial congestion on SR-101 between Downtown LA and west of SR-405.\nAs for surface streets, I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that West LA has the worst conditions (see also \u201cMoving Los Angeles\u201d).\nAs can be seen on Figure 2, and Figure 3.10 in \u201cMoving Los Angeles,\u201d the worst traffic conditions are in and around Downtown LA.\nWhen you compare the traffic congestion patterns, especially those on the freeways, with a map of warehousing, mentioned above, it appears that they are spatially co-related.\nSomebody should conduct a GIS correlation analysis on the phenomenon.\nTraffic Variability and Reliability\nI reason that trucks are, at least partially, responsible for variability of traffic patterns in LA Region, especially during peak periods.\nMost of the other traffic during these periods \u2013 commuter traffic \u2013 has stable patterns.\nOther trip types (than Home-to-Work trips) have certain level of variability.\nThe trip variability issue is worth exploring further/researching, since reliability is critical to improvement of mobility.\ntbc\nAiR-B\nCongestion in LA - ch II\nDemystifying Transit\nTransit \u2013 at the last RTP, a witty professional implied that there is a common public misconception regarding public transit subsidies.\nThe pro suggested conducting a study that would determine real transit subsidies v. real auto trip subsidies.\nThe auto trip costs comprise of everything needed for driving automobile, including the costs of building and maintaining freeways, roads, operation costs of all sorts, congestion costs, health costs, etc. etc.\nThe study could research the costs under current LA conditions (i.e., low density development), but also compare it to other places with more dense development and transit friendly policies such as San Francisco or Toronto, Canada.\nPerhaps these cities can tell us something about LA potential future.\nThis is the challenge to academic community \u2013 who is up to it?\nThe City of LA is trying to accelerate the schedule of future transit improvements.\nCan we help?\nTrucks Taking Over Freeways?\nTrucks \u2013 truck traffic is projected to grow massively.\nThe region needs to consider carefully all potential benefits and costs, including ripple effects of the increase.\nThe last RTP, Goods Movement Report, shows some of the potential impacts.\nTables A8, A10 and A12 imply that future truck traffic will dominate LA freeways, jostling out autos.\nThe autos may be left with little choice but to use surface streets instead of freeways.\nPassenger cars and drivers would incur extra delay, increased driving costs, increased pollution, etc.\nWhat will be the real costs of lost mobility for the residents of the region?\nTbc.\nAiR_B\nCongestion in LA\nVery good article.\nI've read others, apparently related.\nThe congestion caused by truck traffic seems to be under-reported if not underestimated.\nConsidering the facts that a very rapid growth of truck traffic is projected, that the truck fleet changes - more super-heavy vehicles, a closer look into the truck caused congestion seems necessary.\nThe measurements that are commonly used to estimate truck traffic increase - VMT - are not compatible with passenger cars VMT.\nVHT may not fully reflect impact of trucks on congestion.\nI would like to see a change to some statistically proper measurements.\nGood Article\nLA is one of those outlier cities that contradict definitions we use to define places.\nI've heard the term \"dense sprawl\" used to describe LA and I think it's very fitting, and too many people focus on density only in defining sprawl too.\nWhile it has a reasonably high density gradient over the entire metro area, it lacks a true central downtown / job concentration center, has very little mass transit use, and its land uses are oriented heavily towards automobile use.\nI think it's sprawl for every definition of the word, but that's not true in all circumstances.\nI think something can be learned about sprawl, congestion, and metro areas by simply viewing Los Angeles -- as you have -- and comparing it to other metro areas in the US and even abroad.\nGood stuff.\nstill skeptical about those density numbers\nI know you said you are considering regional density, but without seeing how you define the \"region\", that might cause the density numbers to be misleading.\nFor example, if you look at Phoenix, it may be denser than Seattle when considering the giant footprint of all its outlying areas, but ignoring the fact that Seattle is incredibly denser and centralized at its core reduces the usefulness of the numbers you use for this comparison with VMT.\nThe equivalent outlying areas of Seattle might be non-commuting farmland that unfairly bring down its density numbers, as opposed to the sprawling commuting suburbs of Phoenix which give a false impression of relative density.\nI'd be curious to see the same comparison using actual city limits instead of regions.\nRegions defined based on urbanized area within MSAs\nA note of clarification: the regional statistics presented within this article, and in the underlying RAND report, are based on only the \"urbanized area\" within a metropolitan statistical area. As defined by the Census, the urbanized area includes core blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 1000 persons per square mile plus periphery blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 500 persons per square mile. Any blocks or block groups with lower population density are not included in the calculations.\nExcellent point\nThe whole city versus SMSA versus region gets very [statistically] confusing.\nGreat article\nExcellent use of graphics.\nI understand a LOT more about LA traffic than I did before.\nMakes me very happy that I live in Denver.\nDave Barnes\n+1.303.744.9024\nhttp://www.MarketingTactics.com\nAbout Pricing and Impact on Poor...\nThanks for this thought-provoking essay. One of the issues that has confounded earlier attempts at \"volume pricing\" has been the accusation such practices adversely affect the poor and lower middle classes due to lower elasticities of highway travel. This has certainly been cited in discussions about raising the gas tax even higher here in California.\nI see in your piece that, \"pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups.\" If this case can be made more publicly, or, if there can be some sort of trade-off between gas taxes and user fees, this concept could receive greater public support.\nDon't forget about land use patterns\nThanks for the thoughtful article.\nMy only quibble comes with the statement \"contrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale\".\nI've heard this claim made a few times in defense of LA not being \"sprawl\". The problem I have is not with the fact cited, but with the implicit definition of sprawl used.\nIf the word \"sprawl\" is to have any use as a concept, then it cannot be simply a proxy for density.\nFigure 4 demonstrates this - there is clearly something going on in LA that is not captured by density but nonetheless causes it to merit the label of sprawl.\nI would argue that this \"something\" is the pattern of land use.\nIt doesn't matter if you live in a residential neighborhood with 30 units to the acre, if the only thing that's around you for 1/2 a mile is other homes, then you're still probably going to drive to your destination.\nAuto dependence and land use segregation feed back on each other too, since residential areas will be unwilling to accept commercial establishments if they bring excessive traffic in with them.\nThe result is the worst of both worlds, where residents get all the downsides of density with few of the benefits.\nA truly comprehensive solution to congestion requires addressing both transportation policies and land use policies.\nSubscribe to NG Articles\nCONNECT WITH US:\nNewGeography.com is a joint venture of Joel Kotkin and Praxis Strategy Group\nFeatured Content\nThe Coming of Neo-Feudalism\nJoel Kotkin's newest book The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class is now available to order.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is notorious for its severe traffic congestion, consistently ranking first in the U.S. for both total and per-capita congestion delays. The Texas Transportation Institute estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at nearly $10 billion. Congestion is widespread, affecting both freeways and surface streets, particularly between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\n\nRecent economic downturns and rising fuel prices have temporarily eased congestion, but this is expected to be short-lived. As the region's economy and population grow, so will vehicle travel and congestion.\n\nRAND Corporation researchers recommend short-term strategies to reduce LA traffic, focusing on pricing reforms like congestion tolls to manage travel demand. Other measures, such as better transit service and ridesharing programs, can complement pricing but are insufficient on their own.\n\nTraffic congestion results from an imbalance between road supply and peak-hour travel demand. Building more roads is not a viable solution due to space constraints, limited resources, and the phenomenon of 'triple convergence,' where initial traffic reduction benefits are short-lived as drivers adjust their travel patterns.\n\nReducing peak-hour travel demand through improved transit, ridesharing, flexible work hours, and telecommuting is also undermined by triple convergence. Only pricing strategies, which increase the cost of driving or parking during peak hours, promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Pricing not only manages demand but also generates revenue for transportation investments and enables more efficient use of existing road capacity.\n\nLos Angeles, with its high regional population density and high per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT), is particularly suited for pricing strategies. Despite its reputation for sprawl, LA's regional density exacerbates congestion, making pricing an effective tool for managing travel demand.\n\nIn conclusion, pricing strategies offer the most realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in Los Angeles. Other measures can be beneficial but are not as effective as pricing in achieving sustainable traffic congestion reductions.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The document outlines the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) scheduled construction-related lane closures on state roads in Miami Beach. The projects listed include various Financial Identification Numbers (FINs) with specific details on lane closures and detours. Some projects have no lane closures affecting access to/from and in Miami Beach, while others have marked lane closures and detours on the map. The document also includes an archive of past construction schedules from 2020 to 2024, detailing weekly updates on lane closures and detours. The impact of road construction on traffic flow in Miami from March 2024 to July 2024 can be inferred from the specific projects listed during that period, which include lane closures and detours marked on the map.",

    "Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\nWhile traffic congestion plagues many cities, Los Angeles stands apart. The Texas Transportation Institute tracks congestion statistics for U.S. metropolitan areas on an annual basis, and Los Angeles routinely ranks first for both total and per-capita congestion delays. Considering the value of wasted time and fuel, TTI estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at close to $10 billion.\nThe map in Figure 1, based on 2006 Caltrans sensor data, illustrates the weekday pattern of traffic congestion on the LA freeway network. Congestion is pervasive throughout much of the county; most freeways have segments on which traffic averages less than 35 mph at least two hours per day, and many bottlenecks are congested at least four hours per day.\nFigure 1. Traffic Conditions on the LA Freeway Network\nConditions on the surface streets are not much better. The map in Figure 2, based on 2004 volume-to-capacity (V/C) estimates from SCAG, depicts the pattern of afternoon traffic congestion on the county\u2019s largest arterials. Here again it is evident that traffic congestion is broadly dispersed, yet the pattern is particularly intense between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\nFigure 2. Traffic Conditions on LA Surface Streets\nWith the recent run-up in fuel prices followed by a severe recession, total travel in Los Angeles has declined over the past two years, and congestion has correspondingly eased. Yet if past trends hold, this reprieve is likely to be fleeting. Should the region\u2019s economy and population grow in the coming decades, as some forecasts predict, the probable outcome is even more vehicle travel and in turn more intense congestion.\nControversial Solutions for a Daunting Problem\nResearchers at the RAND Corporation were asked to recommend strategies capable of reducing LA traffic within five years or less (the short timeframe rules out land-use reforms along with major infrastructure investments). The resulting report, Moving Los Angeles: Short-Term Policy Options for Improving Transportation, offers recommendations at once controversial and likely inescapable. To achieve lasting traffic relief, it will be necessary to manage the demand for travel through pricing reforms (e.g., congestion tolls) that increase the cost of driving and parking in the busiest corridors and areas during peak travel hours. Other measures\u2014better transit service, ridesharing programs, traffic signal synchronization, and the like\u2014can complement pricing, but are not on their own sufficient to stem current and projected future traffic congestion.\nFew Strategies Offer Much Promise\nJust why should this be so? Consider, first, that traffic congestion results from an imbalance between the supply of roads and peak-hour automotive travel. In fact, congestion can be viewed as a solution (though an unpleasant one) to this imbalance; when demand exceeds supply, congestion makes us wait our turn for available road space to balance the equation. Over the past several decades, the gap between supply and demand has widened considerably; population growth, economic expansion, and rising incomes have fueled the demand for more vehicle travel, while road construction has stagnated. We have therefore been relying, more and more, on congestion to resolve this imbalance.\nOne response would be to build or expand more roads to accommodate additional vehicle travel. Setting aside policy concerns related to greenhouse gas emissions and energy security, the prospects for \u201cbuilding our way out of congestion\u201d are limited. To begin with, there simply isn\u2019t much space to build new roads in Los Angeles, particularly in the most densely developed urban areas. As shown in Figure 3, the density of the road network in the greater Los Angeles region, measured in lane miles per square mile, is already far greater than in any other large metropolitan area in the country.\nFigure 3. Road Network Density in Major Metropolitan Areas\nWe also lack the resources to engage in an extensive road building spree. In recent decades, federal and state elected officials have failed to increase fuel taxes enough to offset the effects of inflation and improved fuel economy, thus hobbling the major source of funding for road construction and repairs.\nEven if we could expand the road network, though, the benefits would be limited by a phenomenon described as \u201ctriple convergence.\u201d Congestion has been a problem for years, and many individuals deliberately alter their travel patterns to avoid severe traffic. When an investment in road capacity reduces peak-hour congestion, many will conclude that they no longer need to go out of their way to avoid congestion delays and will thus \u201cconverge\u201d on the improvement from (a) other times, (b) other routes, or (c) other modes of travel. The net effect is that the initial traffic-reduction benefits will usually not last over time. This is why we often see, for instance, that the improved traffic flow resulting from a new freeway lane does not last for more than a couple of years.\nIf supply-side remedies do not create sustainable reductions in traffic, it becomes necessary to examine ways of reducing peak-hour travel demand. Commonly employed options include improved transit service, voluntary ridesharing programs, flexible work hours, and telecommuting. Unfortunately, the congestion-reduction benefits of these strategies are likewise undermined by triple convergence. If a new subway line induces some peak-hour drivers to switch to transit, other drivers will soon converge on more freely flowing roads to take their place. Indeed, the effects of triple convergence explain why traffic congestion has grown steadily worse despite considerable state and local investment in a broad range of congestion-reduction strategies.\nOnly Pricing Strategies Promise Sustainable Reductions in Traffic Congestion\nThis brings us to the rationale for pricing strategies. Among the many possible options for reducing traffic congestion, only pricing resist the effects of triple convergence. By increasing the cost of driving or parking in the busiest areas or corridors during the busiest times of day, pricing measures manage the demand for peak-hour travel, in turn reducing congestion. Once traffic flow improves, the prices remain in place, thus deterring excessive convergence on the newly freed capacity.\nPricing strategies offer two additional benefits. First, pricing generates revenue to support needed transportation investments. And in comparison to sales taxes, a common option for raising local transportation revenue, pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups (though wealthier individuals consume more taxable goods than their less-affluent counterparts, to an even greater extent they (a) drive more, (b) are more likely to travel during peak hours, and (c) are more likely to pay peak-hour tolls rather than alter their travel choices). Second, pricing enables more efficient use of the road capacity that we already have, because roads on which traffic flows smoothly (at roughly 40 mph or higher) can carry far more vehicles per lane per hour than roads snarled in stop-and-go congestion. Paradoxically, then, we see that the introduction of pricing enables roads to accommodate more peak-hour trips. It is therefore useful to think of pricing as a means of managing peak-hour travel demand rather than reducing it.\nPricing Strategies Will Be Particularly Valuable in Los Angeles\nPricing holds promise for most major cities, but the case in Los Angeles is especially compelling. To understand why, it is necessary to consider the interactions between population density and travel behavior, factors that help to explain the severity of LA traffic.\nContrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale. Downtown Los Angeles isn't as dense as, say, Manhattan or central Chicago, but the suburbs surrounding Los Angeles are much denser than the typical suburb, leading to high aggregate density on a regional basis.\nAs population density increases, individuals tend to drive less on a per-capita basis. Trip origins and destinations are closer together, leading to shorter car trips, and in dense neighborhoods people can rely on alternatives such as walking, biking, or transit for a larger share of trips. Yet this can be overwhelmed by the fact that there are also more drivers competing for the same road space within a given area, thus intensifying traffic congestion. The net effect is that greater population density tends to exacerbate congestion\u2014think downtown Manhattan.\nLA traffic congestion is further exacerbated by the fact that Angelinos do not curtail their driving as much as one would expect in response to higher population density. Figure 4 compares per-capita vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and population density for the 14 largest metropolitan regions in the country.\nFigure 4. Population Density vs. Per-Capita VMT for the 14 Largest U.S. Metropolitan Regions\nLooking across the different regions, there is a fairly consistent relationship in which per-capita VMT declines with regional density. Los Angeles, though, bucks this trend. The only other metropolitan regions with higher per-capita VMT (Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Detroit) are all much less dense than Los Angeles. For regions in which the level of density approaches that of Los Angeles (San Francisco, Washington D.C., and New York), per-capita VMT is much lower.\nIn short, we see a confluence of three density-related factors that combine to explain the severity of congestion in Los Angeles: (1) congestion is likely to rise with increased population density; (2) Los Angeles is much denser than its peers at the regional level; and (3) Los Angeles exhibits a surprisingly high level of per-capita VMT relative to its density. The third of these underscores the importance of pricing strategies as a means of managing the demand for automotive travel in Los Angeles.\nIn the end only pricing strategies promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Other measures \u2013 including improvements in alternative transportation modes \u2013 can be beneficial, but none will be nearly as effective as pricing. This recommendation will no doubt stir controversy, but pricing offers the only realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in the most traffic-choked of American metropolises.\nDr. Paul Sorensen is an operations researcher at the RAND Corporation, wherehe serves as Associate Director of the Transportation, Space, and Technology program.\nDr. Sorensen has published peer-reviewed studies in the areas of geographic information analysis, location optimization modeling, emergency response logistics, and transportation finance policy, and he also holds aU.S. patent on a methodology for forecasting the demand for ambulance services. Dr. Sorensen received a BA in computer science from Dartmouth College, an MA in urban planning from UCLA, and a PhD in geography from UCSB.\nComment viewing options\nCongestion in LA ch III\nMeasuring truck performance vs. truck contribution to congestion (impacts)\nIn current practice, truck performance is most often measured in VMTs and VHTs.\nThe approach focuses on a driver but does not inform about \u201ccosts\u201d or comparative impacts on the region.\nIt does not assess contribution made by PCs and trucks to congestion or consumption of roadway capacity.\nPlanners need to develop measures which would enable them to evaluate these phenomena and evaluate impacts of the vehicle types in a comparable way.\nThe most straightforward solution is to utilize: VMT multiplied by Passenger Car Equivalencies (VMT*PCE), Vehicle Hours Traveled multiplied by PCE (VHT*PCE), and delay multiplied by PCE (delay*PCE).\nA recent study, conducted in Oregon (ODOT), recommends three other useful measures, although, a bit more onerous and limited - they do not allow region-wide comparisons.\nAnother measure that could be used to compare inter-regional conditions is VMT*PCE per lane mile of freeways, highways, or both.\nTruck Logistics\nTruck logistics in LA are \u201cimperfect\u201d/faulty.\nA geographical illustration of these logistics can be found on a map of warehousing, SCAG P&P TAC meeting of 8/11/10, \u201cGoods Movement Update\u201d, page 4.\nThe region cannot afford to build-up on the logistics.\nNew approach needs to be developed.\nFirstly, analysis of truck operations should be broken into three trip categories: (a) local/delivery trips, (b) out-of-region trips, and (c) in-transit/through trips.\nThen, one shall develop brand new logistics for the future and compare them to those currently projected.\nFinally, a realistic evaluation should be made - what can and what cannot be changed of the projected logistics.\nThe evaluation should be based on real and inclusive cost-benefit analysis.\nDifferent objectives can be set for each of truck trip category.\nFor example: for delivery trucks one may want to minimize VMT or, potentially, minimize VMT of goods transported.\nThe current trend of delivering more and more goods by super-heavy duty trucks circling the city and delivering a \u201ccase of beer\u201d per destination should be reversed.\nThe region needs more, smaller warehouses located in close distance to the customer.\nThen, smaller trucks can deliver \u201cretail\u201d orders, minimizing miles traveled.\nSpecific, more focused objectives can be set for the other categories.\nTraffic Congestion Geography\nThe freeway congestion, shown on Figure 1, indicates a radial pattern with a center in Downtown LA.\nSeveral maps that I\u2019ve saved at various hours from PeMS web network and other services including Google, Yahoo, and Sigalert since 2007, confirm the above observation.\nIn addition, one can see frequent, and apparently worsening, adverse conditions on SR-605 between SR-105 and SR-60 and on SR-91 east of SR-710.\nDuring peak periods there is substantial congestion on SR-101 between Downtown LA and west of SR-405.\nAs for surface streets, I respectfully disagree with the conclusion that West LA has the worst conditions (see also \u201cMoving Los Angeles\u201d).\nAs can be seen on Figure 2, and Figure 3.10 in \u201cMoving Los Angeles,\u201d the worst traffic conditions are in and around Downtown LA.\nWhen you compare the traffic congestion patterns, especially those on the freeways, with a map of warehousing, mentioned above, it appears that they are spatially co-related.\nSomebody should conduct a GIS correlation analysis on the phenomenon.\nTraffic Variability and Reliability\nI reason that trucks are, at least partially, responsible for variability of traffic patterns in LA Region, especially during peak periods.\nMost of the other traffic during these periods \u2013 commuter traffic \u2013 has stable patterns.\nOther trip types (than Home-to-Work trips) have certain level of variability.\nThe trip variability issue is worth exploring further/researching, since reliability is critical to improvement of mobility.\ntbc\nAiR-B\nCongestion in LA - ch II\nDemystifying Transit\nTransit \u2013 at the last RTP, a witty professional implied that there is a common public misconception regarding public transit subsidies.\nThe pro suggested conducting a study that would determine real transit subsidies v. real auto trip subsidies.\nThe auto trip costs comprise of everything needed for driving automobile, including the costs of building and maintaining freeways, roads, operation costs of all sorts, congestion costs, health costs, etc. etc.\nThe study could research the costs under current LA conditions (i.e., low density development), but also compare it to other places with more dense development and transit friendly policies such as San Francisco or Toronto, Canada.\nPerhaps these cities can tell us something about LA potential future.\nThis is the challenge to academic community \u2013 who is up to it?\nThe City of LA is trying to accelerate the schedule of future transit improvements.\nCan we help?\nTrucks Taking Over Freeways?\nTrucks \u2013 truck traffic is projected to grow massively.\nThe region needs to consider carefully all potential benefits and costs, including ripple effects of the increase.\nThe last RTP, Goods Movement Report, shows some of the potential impacts.\nTables A8, A10 and A12 imply that future truck traffic will dominate LA freeways, jostling out autos.\nThe autos may be left with little choice but to use surface streets instead of freeways.\nPassenger cars and drivers would incur extra delay, increased driving costs, increased pollution, etc.\nWhat will be the real costs of lost mobility for the residents of the region?\nTbc.\nAiR_B\nCongestion in LA\nVery good article.\nI've read others, apparently related.\nThe congestion caused by truck traffic seems to be under-reported if not underestimated.\nConsidering the facts that a very rapid growth of truck traffic is projected, that the truck fleet changes - more super-heavy vehicles, a closer look into the truck caused congestion seems necessary.\nThe measurements that are commonly used to estimate truck traffic increase - VMT - are not compatible with passenger cars VMT.\nVHT may not fully reflect impact of trucks on congestion.\nI would like to see a change to some statistically proper measurements.\nGood Article\nLA is one of those outlier cities that contradict definitions we use to define places.\nI've heard the term \"dense sprawl\" used to describe LA and I think it's very fitting, and too many people focus on density only in defining sprawl too.\nWhile it has a reasonably high density gradient over the entire metro area, it lacks a true central downtown / job concentration center, has very little mass transit use, and its land uses are oriented heavily towards automobile use.\nI think it's sprawl for every definition of the word, but that's not true in all circumstances.\nI think something can be learned about sprawl, congestion, and metro areas by simply viewing Los Angeles -- as you have -- and comparing it to other metro areas in the US and even abroad.\nGood stuff.\nstill skeptical about those density numbers\nI know you said you are considering regional density, but without seeing how you define the \"region\", that might cause the density numbers to be misleading.\nFor example, if you look at Phoenix, it may be denser than Seattle when considering the giant footprint of all its outlying areas, but ignoring the fact that Seattle is incredibly denser and centralized at its core reduces the usefulness of the numbers you use for this comparison with VMT.\nThe equivalent outlying areas of Seattle might be non-commuting farmland that unfairly bring down its density numbers, as opposed to the sprawling commuting suburbs of Phoenix which give a false impression of relative density.\nI'd be curious to see the same comparison using actual city limits instead of regions.\nRegions defined based on urbanized area within MSAs\nA note of clarification: the regional statistics presented within this article, and in the underlying RAND report, are based on only the \"urbanized area\" within a metropolitan statistical area. As defined by the Census, the urbanized area includes core blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 1000 persons per square mile plus periphery blocks or block groups with a population density of at least 500 persons per square mile. Any blocks or block groups with lower population density are not included in the calculations.\nExcellent point\nThe whole city versus SMSA versus region gets very [statistically] confusing.\nGreat article\nExcellent use of graphics.\nI understand a LOT more about LA traffic than I did before.\nMakes me very happy that I live in Denver.\nDave Barnes\n+1.303.744.9024\nhttp://www.MarketingTactics.com\nAbout Pricing and Impact on Poor...\nThanks for this thought-provoking essay. One of the issues that has confounded earlier attempts at \"volume pricing\" has been the accusation such practices adversely affect the poor and lower middle classes due to lower elasticities of highway travel. This has certainly been cited in discussions about raising the gas tax even higher here in California.\nI see in your piece that, \"pricing has been shown to reduce the relative tax burden on lower income groups.\" If this case can be made more publicly, or, if there can be some sort of trade-off between gas taxes and user fees, this concept could receive greater public support.\nDon't forget about land use patterns\nThanks for the thoughtful article.\nMy only quibble comes with the statement \"contrary to its reputation for sprawl, Los Angeles is quite densely populated when viewed at the regional scale\".\nI've heard this claim made a few times in defense of LA not being \"sprawl\". The problem I have is not with the fact cited, but with the implicit definition of sprawl used.\nIf the word \"sprawl\" is to have any use as a concept, then it cannot be simply a proxy for density.\nFigure 4 demonstrates this - there is clearly something going on in LA that is not captured by density but nonetheless causes it to merit the label of sprawl.\nI would argue that this \"something\" is the pattern of land use.\nIt doesn't matter if you live in a residential neighborhood with 30 units to the acre, if the only thing that's around you for 1/2 a mile is other homes, then you're still probably going to drive to your destination.\nAuto dependence and land use segregation feed back on each other too, since residential areas will be unwilling to accept commercial establishments if they bring excessive traffic in with them.\nThe result is the worst of both worlds, where residents get all the downsides of density with few of the benefits.\nA truly comprehensive solution to congestion requires addressing both transportation policies and land use policies.\nSubscribe to NG Articles\nCONNECT WITH US:\nNewGeography.com is a joint venture of Joel Kotkin and Praxis Strategy Group\nFeatured Content\nThe Coming of Neo-Feudalism\nJoel Kotkin's newest book The Coming of Neo-Feudalism: A Warning to the Global Middle Class is now available to order.

    "Summarized_Document1": "Reducing Traffic Congestion and Improving Travel Options in Los Angeles\n\nLos Angeles is notorious for its severe traffic congestion, consistently ranking first in the U.S. for both total and per-capita congestion delays. The Texas Transportation Institute estimates the annual cost of traffic congestion in greater Los Angeles at nearly $10 billion. Congestion is widespread, affecting both freeways and surface streets, particularly between downtown Los Angeles and the Westside.\n\nRecent economic downturns and rising fuel prices have temporarily eased congestion, but this is expected to be short-lived. As the region's economy and population grow, so will vehicle travel and congestion.\n\nRAND Corporation researchers recommend short-term strategies to reduce LA traffic, focusing on pricing reforms like congestion tolls to manage travel demand. Other measures, such as better transit service and ridesharing programs, can complement pricing but are insufficient on their own.\n\nTraffic congestion results from an imbalance between road supply and peak-hour travel demand. Building more roads is not a viable solution due to space constraints, limited resources, and the phenomenon of 'triple convergence,' where initial traffic reduction benefits are short-lived as drivers adjust their travel patterns.\n\nReducing peak-hour travel demand through improved transit, ridesharing, flexible work hours, and telecommuting is also undermined by triple convergence. Only pricing strategies, which increase the cost of driving or parking during peak hours, promise sustainable reductions in traffic congestion. Pricing not only manages demand but also generates revenue for transportation investments and enables more efficient use of existing road capacity.\n\nLos Angeles, with its high regional population density and high per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT), is particularly suited for pricing strategies. Despite its reputation for sprawl, LA's regional density exacerbates congestion, making pricing an effective tool for managing travel demand.\n\nIn conclusion, pricing strategies offer the most realistic prospects for managing peak-hour travel demand in Los Angeles. Other measures can be beneficial but are not as effective as pricing in achieving sustainable traffic congestion reductions.",

These analyses help identify trends, patterns, and correlations, which are then grouped into fatal crash typologies. This supports CDOT\u2019s efforts to develop data-informed actions to increase traffic safety.In March 2024, there were several fatal traffic crashes in Chicago. Notable incidents include:- On March 1, a driver struck a light pole and trees at 4140 W 83rd St.- On March 3, a driver struck a pedestrian on Marquette Rd, and another incident involved a left-turning driver failing to yield, resulting in a passenger's death.- On March 13, a driver struck a pedestrian on the sidewalk at 1700 W Van Buren St.- On March 15, a driver struck a parked semi-truck at 4901 W Madison St.Fatal traffic crashes in March 2024 (provisional data) show:- 4 pedestrians killed- 0 bicyclists killed- 7 motor vehicle occupants killed- Total of 11 fatalitiesComparing data from January to March 2024 with the same period in 2023:- 2024: 12 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 12 motor vehicle occupants, total 24 fatalities- 2023: 16 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 17 motor vehicle occupants, total 33 fatalitiesHistorical data from IDOT for January to March averages:- 5-year average (2018-2022): 8.6 pedestrians, 1.2 bicyclists, 16.8 motor vehicle occupants, total 26.6 fatalities- 10-year average (2013-2022): 9 pedestrians, 0.8 bicyclists, 16 motor vehicle occupants, total 25.8 fatalitiesTraffic fatalities in Chicago have varied over the years, with notable increases in certain years. For example, in 2021, there were 186 fatalities, compared to 160 in 2022. Serious injuries also show fluctuations, with 2,215 serious injuries in 2022 compared to 2,299 in 2021.The data highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis to improve traffic safety and reduce fatalities and serious injuries in Chicago.",

    "Summarized_Document1": "The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) conducts timely analyses of fatal traffic crash reports provided by the Chicago Police Department (CPD) to understand the circumstances of such crashes. These analyses help identify trends, patterns, and correlations, which are then grouped into fatal crash typologies. This supports CDOT\u2019s efforts to develop data-informed actions to increase traffic safety.In March 2024, there were several fatal traffic crashes in Chicago. Notable incidents include:- On March 1, a driver struck a light pole and trees at 4140 W 83rd St.- On March 3, a driver struck a pedestrian on Marquette Rd, and another incident involved a left-turning driver failing to yield, resulting in a passenger's death.- On March 13, a driver struck a pedestrian on the sidewalk at 1700 W Van Buren St.- On March 15, a driver struck a parked semi-truck at 4901 W Madison St.Fatal traffic crashes in March 2024 (provisional data) show:- 4 pedestrians killed- 0 bicyclists killed- 7 motor vehicle occupants killed- Total of 11 fatalitiesComparing data from January to March 2024 with the same period in 2023:- 2024: 12 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 12 motor vehicle occupants, total 24 fatalities- 2023: 16 pedestrians, 0 bicyclists, 17 motor vehicle occupants, total 33 fatalitiesHistorical data from IDOT for January to March averages:- 5-year average (2018-2022): 8.6 pedestrians, 1.2 bicyclists, 16.8 motor vehicle occupants, total 26.6 fatalities- 10-year average (2013-2022): 9 pedestrians, 0.8 bicyclists, 16 motor vehicle occupants, total 25.8 fatalitiesTraffic fatalities in Chicago have varied over the years, with notable increases in certain years. For example, in 2021, there were 186 fatalities, compared to 160 in 2022. Serious injuries also show fluctuations, with 2,215 serious injuries in 2022 compared to 2,299 in 2021.The data highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and analysis to improve traffic safety and reduce fatalities and serious injuries in Chicago.",
    "Summarized_Document2": "The document outlines the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) scheduled construction-related lane closures on state roads in Miami Beach. The projects listed include various Financial Identification Numbers (FINs) with specific details on lane closures and detours. Some projects have no lane closures affecting access to/from and in Miami Beach, while others have marked lane closures and detours on the map. The document also includes an archive of past construction schedules from 2020 to 2024, detailing weekly updates on lane closures and detours. The impact of road construction on traffic flow in Miami from March 2024 to July 2024 can be inferred from the specific projects listed during that period, which include lane closures and detours marked on the map.",
