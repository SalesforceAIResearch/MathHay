      "Golden State Warriors\nCharlotte Hornets\nStephen Curry returns home, scores 23 points to lead Warriors past Hornets 115-97\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- \u2014 Stephen Curry scored 23 points with four 3-pointers in his annual homecoming game and the Golden State Warriors beat the Charlotte Hornets 115-97 on Friday night for their third straight win.\n              Curry, who grew up here and starred at nearby Davidson College before entering the NBA draft as a first-round pick in 2009, had 12 points in the pivotal third quarter as the Warriors blew open a close game.\n              Curry has always relished returning to play in Charlotte and seeing family and old friends, but the previous four games here have resulted in losses.\n              \u201cAt this stage (of my career) I can probably count on one hand how many times I get to come back here,\" Curry said. \u201cIt was nice seeing a lot of familiar faces in the crowd. And, it was nice to actually get a win.\u201d\n Andrew Wiggins had a big role in that, turning in another strong game with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points for the Warriors, who are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and battling the Houston Rockets for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Rockets won their 11th straight, 101-100 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night and are a game behind the Warriors.\n Fred VanVleet had 22 points, Amen Thompson added 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jabari Smith, Jr. scored 14 points for the Rocke\n              Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that is a reflection of just how tough the West is this season.\n              \u201cWe had a similar record last year and we were the sixth seed,\u201d Kerr said.\n              Golden State limited Charlotte to 41% shooting and held its third straight opponent to fewer than 100 points.\n              \u201cI feel like we are starting out the game engaged on the floor and talking, and that has carried over,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n Miles Bridges had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Charlotte, which failed in its bid to win back-to-back games for the first time since the All-Star break.\n              Curry always packs the Spectrum Center and Friday night was no exception.\n              With his brother Seth and father Dell looking on, Curry finished the game 9 of 18 from the field. Seth plays for Charlotte but is out with an ankle injury, while Dell is a broadcaster for the Hornets.\n              Curry admitted there has always been a \"curiosity\" about playing for the Hornets, where his father was a star but said his intentions are to remain in the Bay Area.\n              Charlotte rookie Brandon Miller briefly left the game with 8 1/2 minutes left after his leg got tangled up with Draymond Green while going for a rebound. He had just 12 points after making a career-high seven 3s and scoring 31 points on Monday night.\n              Green, who was ejected from the Warriors last game against Orlando, was later whistled for a foul when he appeared to push Charlotte\u2019s Grant Williams to the ground. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but the play was upheld.\n              The Warriors had no problems scoring against the Hornets, repeatedly taking advantage of breakdowns by Charlotte\u2019s defense, finding wide open players underneath the basket on three different occasions.\n              \u201cTrayce (Jackson-Davis) did a great job on the boards today, gave them second opportunities, and with the Warriors, you can\u2019t do that with everybody on their team who can shoot,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey were making shots, they were cutting hard and they were getting second-chance points.\u201d \n              The Warriors played without Klay Thompson, who sat out with tendinitis in his right knee.\n Chris Paul got the start in his place and had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, including a lob over three players to Jackson-Davis for a dunk.\n              Jackson-Davis said Paul thought he threw the ball over his head.\n              \u201cI had some sneaky bunnies and I went up and got it,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n              UP NEXT\n              Warriors: Visit Spurs on Sunday night.\n              Hornets: Host Clippers on Sunday night.\n              ----\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\nRegular Season Series\nGame Information\n2024-25 Pacific Standings\n2024-25 Southeast Standings\nNBA News\nToronto takes on Charlotte for conference matchup\nWashington takes on conference foe Atlanta\nPhiladelphia and Detroit square off in conference showdown\n",
      "2024 Golden State Warriors Playoffs Picture after loss vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Updated standings, schedule and\u00a0more\u00a0(March\u00a024)\nThe Golden State Warriors (36-33) faced a significant challenge as they clashed with the Minnesota Timberwolves (48-22) on Sunday night. With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime. Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga also made significant contributions with 11 points each in the first half.\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\nIn the third quarter, the Timberwolves mounted a comeback, narrowing the gap to three points with a score of 81-78. Mike Conley led Minnesota's resurgence with six points, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker also chipped in six points in the Timberwolves rally.\nDespite Minnesota's efforts, Steph Curry led the charge to maintain Golden State's lead, adding eight points in the quarter. Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory. Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role in Minnesota's win, contributing 23 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid delivered double-double performances to aid Edwards in securing the victory.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Updated Standings\nAfter suffering from a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Golden State Warriors now have a 36-34 record. While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference. Winning those two games would keep their Play-In Tournament hopes alive.\nTimberwolves Nation!

      "2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 Boston Red Sox | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 Boston Red Sox, a blend of youth and experience, is a team to watch. The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right. The 2024 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for the Boston Red Sox.\" - Baseball Almanac.\n2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Official Logo\n2023 \u2190 Complete Schedule for the 2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule | Research by Baseball Almanac\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Boston Red Sox home / road splits for the 2024 regular season were 38-43 (0.469 winning percentage) at home and 43-38 (0.531 winning percentage) on the road.\nDid you know that the 2024 Boston Red Sox were 15-11 during the month of June?

      "2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 Boston Red Sox | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 Boston Red Sox, a blend of youth and experience, is a team to watch. The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right. The 2024 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for the Boston Red Sox.\" - Baseball Almanac.\n2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Official Logo\n2023 \u2190 Complete Schedule for the 2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule | Research by Baseball Almanac\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Boston Red Sox home / road splits for the 2024 regular season were 38-43 (0.469 winning percentage) at home and 43-38 (0.531 winning percentage) on the road.\nDid you know that the 2024 Boston Red Sox were 15-11 during the month of June?
