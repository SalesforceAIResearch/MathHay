The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's  Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap.

All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.10%  per year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through October 7, 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Though hiring has slowed\u2014average payroll gains over the past three months were 116,000\u2014the U.S. job market continues to generate solid job gains and wage growth that is consistently beating inflation.\nFor more details on today\u2019s report, see CEA\u2019s X thread.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt 4.2% the unemployment rate, while still low, is up half-a-point from the beginning of the year. What\u2019s behind this increase? There is no single, simple answer, but one factor behind the July increase was so-called temporary unemployment. The dynamics of unemployment over the past two months are a reminder that temporary unemployment has a less-persistent impact on the unemployment rate relative to more permanent layoffs.\nWorkers get labeled as temporarily unemployed when they aren\u2019t working, but say that they expect to be recalled to their prior employer sometime in the near future. Typically, this is a small fraction of unemployment\u2014on average 13% from 2016\u201319\u2014 with an exception being Spring and Summer 2020, when many Americans were in this position because of the pandemic. (See Figure 1.)\nIn July, temporary unemployment rose by 250,000\u2014the large majority of the overall 350,000 rise in unemployment that month. It\u2019s hard to say what caused this (it doesn\u2019t appear to be related to a hurricane), but what we know is that temporarily unemployed workers are much more likely to quickly regain employment than other unemployed workers. Over the last year, 52% of the temporarily unemployed were re-employed in the next month, and only 3% become permanent job losers (i.e., those who are involuntarily unemployed without expectation of recall to their prior employer). Indeed, this is consistent with what we saw in this morning\u2019s data for August: temporary unemployment fell back by 190,000, putting downward pressure on the overall unemployment rate.\nEven with the tick down in August\u2019s unemployment rate, it is still up from a low of 3.4% in April of last year. Some economists view this as a cause for concern because\u2014historically speaking\u2014when the unemployment rate goes up this much, it tends to keep rising.[1]\nBut there are reasons why that historical experience may not hold true in today\u2019s labor market, especially when we consider this indicator in the context of many other positive economic developments, like strong consumer spending and GDP growth (more on those in a moment).\nOne reason relates to the unusual situation of mid-2023, when the unemployment rate was at its minimum. The U.S. labor market was recovering from an unprecedented pandemic-induced recession with the aid of similarly unprecedented fiscal policy support. This drove the unemployment rate down to a level it had not reached since the beginning of the Nixon Administration. We have little relevant guidance from past experience with unemployment rising from such a low level.\nTo see this point, consider the behavior of unemployment insurance claims just last year. Before 2023, high year-over-year growth in continuing claims (i.e., the number of unemployment insurance recipients, roughly speaking) was almost always associated with a recession. (See Figure 2.) But even though that growth rate rose to about 30% in mid-2023\u2014a rate typically indicative of recession\u2014the crucial context was that mid-2022 continuing claims had been historically low due to a combination of the tight labor market and the hangover from the pandemic. As such, simply returning to a normal level meant big increases from that low baseline. And as we have seen since mid-2023, the rise in continued claims last summer was clearly not associated with a recession.\nStepping back from the details of unemployment, most indicators of economic vitality remain strong as we close out summer 2024. While payroll employment growth has cooled, it remains positive and consistent with a stable labor market providing ample opportunities to job seekers. Yearly wage growth was 3.8% in August and 4.1% for lower- and middle-wage workers. While we do not yet know inflation for August, it is extremely likely that these wage-growth rates add another month to the 15-month tally of wage growth outpacing price growth through July, meaning real wage gains.\nInitial and continuing claims for unemployment insurance remain relatively low and similar to their pre-pandemic levels. And at 83.9%, prime-age labor force participation is just below its highest level in more than twenty years.\nTurning to other, related measures of economic activity, real GDP is on very solid footing, driven by strong consumer spending (itself supported by the real wage gains just noted) and a positive trend in business investment. Reflecting this optimistic outlook, small business creation has been setting records in recent years.\nIn other words, today\u2019s jobs report along with a broad array of economic data are consistent with steady growth, easing inflationary pressures, real wage and income gains, and no notable recent increase in permanent layoffs. CEA will continue to monitor and contextualize these trends, as we work with the Biden-Harris team to maintain and build on this progress on behalf of American families.\n[1] The commonly used Sahm Indicator captures this tendency: it is calculated as the difference between the current unemployment rate and the unemployment rate minimum over the preceding twelve months (where all rates are calculated as their three-month trailing averages).\nStay Connected\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe White House\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington, DC 20500\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.\nKey Points\n\nSNPINDEX: ^GSPC\n\nS&P 500 Index\nThe stock market had an unexpectedly good September, and momentum could carry the S&P 500 higher in the fourth quarter.\nSeptember has historically been the weakest month of the year for the U.S. stock market. In the last two decades, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.27%) has declined by an average of 0.6% during September, which is a half-percentage point worse than the next closest month.\nThat inexplicable phenomenon, aptly known as the \"September Effect,\" failed to materialize this year. Instead, the S&P 500 advanced 2% to clench its best September since 2013. And history says that momentum spill into the remaining months of 2024.\nHere's what investors should know.\nHistory says the S&P 500 is headed higher in the remaining months of 2024\nThe U.S. stock market's unexpectedly strong September was a product of solid financial results and interest rate cuts. Specifically, S&P 500 companies recorded earnings growth of 11.3% in the second quarter of 2024, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years. Lower rates should strengthen the economy by encouraging consumer spending and business investments, which itself should drive continued strength in corporate earnings.\nEnthusiasm born of those events pushed the S&P 500 higher in September, something that has happened only 11 other times in the last two decades. The chart below shows how the index performed over the three-month and 12-month periods following positive Septembers in the past.\nYear\n3-Month Return\n12-Month Return\n2004\n9%\n10%\n2005\n2%\n9%\n2006\n6%\n14%\n2007\n(4%)\n(24%)\n2009\n5%\n(26%)\n2010\n10%\n(1%)\n2012\n(1%)\n17%\n2013\n10%\n17%\n2017\n(1%)\n16%\n2018\n(14%)\n2%\n2019\n9%\n13%\nMedian\n5%\n10%\nData source: YCharts. The chart shows the S&P 500's performance during the three-month period and 12-month period following a positive return in September of the listed year.\nAs shown above, during the last two decades, the S&P 500 has achieved a median three-month return of 5% and a median 12-month return of 10% following a positive result in September. We can use that information to make an educated guess about the current situation.\nSpecifically, the S&P 500 has fallen 1% since the end of September. That leaves implied upside of 6% over the next three months and 11% over the next 12 months. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but those predictions are very plausible.\nThe fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of the year for the stock market due to the expectation that holiday spending will help the economy. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.3% in the fourth quarter, more than doubling its performance in the next best quarter, according to Carson Group.\nAdditionally, the S&P 500 advanced 193% in the last decade, excluding dividends. That equates to 11.3% annually. So, an 11% return during the next 12-month period that ends in September 2025 would actually qualify as below average. Regardless, investors should be cautious in the current market environment.\nThe S&P 500 could be derailed by historically expensive stock prices\nMany stocks are expensive by historical standards. The S&P 500 trades at 27 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.8 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.7 times earnings. As a result, several Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline in the remaining months of 2024.\nThe chart below lists Wall Street's year-end price targets for the S&P 500. It also shows the implied upside or downside (compared to its current level of 5,710) associated with each forecast.\nWall Street Firm\nS&P 500 Year-End Target\nImplied Upside (Downside)\nBMO Capital Markets\n6,100\n7%\nEvercore\n6,000\n5%\nOppenheimer\n5,900\n3%\nYardeni Research\n5,800\n2%\nDeutsche Bank\n5,750\n1%\nRBC Capital\n5,700\n0%\nUBS\n5,600\n(2%)\nCiti\n5,600\n(2%)\nGoldman Sachs\n5,600\n(2%)\nBarclays\n5,600\n(2%)\nWells Fargo\n5,535\n(3%)\nBank of America\n5,400\n(5%)\nFundstrat\n5,200\n(9%)\nJPMorgan Chase\n4,200\n(26%)\nMedian\n5,200\n(2%)\nData source: Yahoo Finance.\nAs shown above, Wall Street's year-end targets for the S&P 500 imply outcomes ranging from 7% upside to 26% downside in the remaining months of 2024. But the median forecast of 5,600 implies 2% downside.\nHere's the bottom line: History says the S&P 500 will have a strong fourth quarter. But stocks are historically expensive, so the first sign of economic trouble could trigger a market correction or even a bear market. So, investors should be particularly cognizant of valuations when buying stocks in the current environment.\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

      "Federal funds rate history: 1990 to today\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach. Katherine holds an MBA, and is a former staff writer for Fit Small Business. She is a regular contributor to Forbes and maintains a popular lifestyle and travel blog.\nAbigail Rueger is a deputy editor on the banking team at Fortune Recommends. She is passionate about personal finance and offering consumers actionable steps for making positive life changes. Prior to joining Fortune, Abigail spent four years as an editor for Choosing Therapy, a startup dedicated to providing the best mental health information on the web.\u00a0\nSet by the Federal Reserve\u2014or the \u2018Fed\u2019\u2014the federal funds rate helps stabilize the economy during growth and recession. In recent decades, the Fed\u2019s choice to raise or lower rates has been in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis of 2008. \nKnowing how and why the Fed changes these rates can help you better understand how their decisions affect everyday Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding Fed Interest Rate Decisions\nThink of the federal fund rate as a thermostat for the economy. When the economy begins to overheat\u2014shown by rising inflation and unsustainable growth\u2014the Fed raises the \u2018temperature\u2019 by increasing interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. \nConversely, during a recession, or when the economy starts to \u2018freeze,\u2019 the Fed lowers the thermostat by cutting rates, encouraging borrowing and spending to help warm things back up.\u00a0\nThe federal funds rate helps maintain the economy\u2019s \u2018temperature\u2019\u2014not too hot, not too cold. It influences everything from mortgage rates to consumer spending.\nExpert insight\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have a direct impact on consumers and businesses. When rates rise, borrowing costs go up, meaning your mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and business debt can become more expensive. On the flip side, lower rates make it cheaper to borrow, which can help with big purchases like homes, cars, and business expansion.But it\u2019s not all bad news when rates go up\u2014savers benefit from higher returns on cash in savings accounts, CDs, and bonds, allowing their money to earn more interest. Whether you\u2019re borrowing or saving, Fed rate changes ripple through the economy and affect your financial well-being in a number of ways.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tudor, CFP, CAP \u2013 Investment Advisor\nDrawbacks of interest rate decisions by the Fed\nThe Fed\u2019s policies, though aimed at stabilizing the broader economy, often have unintended side effects. Jason Ray, president and chief information officer (CIO) of Zenith Wealth Partners, says, \u201cWhile necessary, the Fed\u2019s actions often disproportionately benefit financial markets and asset holders, raising questions about long-term wealth inequality under its policies. \nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act often amplifies existing socioeconomic divides, especially when rate changes disproportionately impact borrowers or savers across different income levels. Is the focus on employment and inflation inadvertently deepening these structural inequalities?\u201d\nWhat impacts the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process?\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 members\u2014seven from the Board of Governors and five from regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014who meet regularly to take a closer look at economic indicators. They use these indicators to help make decisions about monetary policy, such as whether or not to change the federal funds rate.\nThe key indicators that the Fed monitors are:\nThe role of the \u201cdot plot\u201d and forward guidance\nIn addition to current economic data, the FOMC also considers future expectations, known as the \u2018dot plot.\u2019 All twelve FOMC members submit their future projections for short- and long-term interest rates. This can help gauge the committee\u2019s views on the future of the economy and help guide the Fed\u2019s overall strategy.\u00a0\nForward guidance also helps the Fed signal future intentions. By communicating whether rates will go up or down in the near future, the Fed can guide future market behavior, aiming to provide some stability for the market. For example, if the Fed says rates are likely to stay low for a long time, a business might be more likely to invest because they know borrowing rates will be affordable.\u00a0\nThe Fed must balance economic growth while keeping inflation in check. It does this by making data-driven decisions based on factors like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior. In addition to these indicators, there are other considerations, like trade tensions, global events, and geopolitical risks. For example, the pandemic, the 2008 financial meltdown, and wars impacted the Fed\u2019s decisions.\nThe FOMC\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t safe from scrutiny\u2014they face this from the public, political leaders, and markets. Because the Federal Reserve is independent, it can focus on the economy\u2019s long-term health without the interference of short-term political pressure. However, its decisions have far-reaching effects on businesses, consumers, and the entire global economy.\nThe global influence of federal funds rate changes\nDecisions made by the Fed affect more than just the United States. In fact, they can impact the economy, markets, and central banks worldwide. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and when the Fed makes policies, it also shapes global financial conditions.\u00a0\nWhen rates are raised or cut, there\u2019s a global chain reaction impacting everything from international trade to exchange rates to capital flows and foreign investment:\n2022-2024: Fed rate hikes & cuts\nThe Fed\u2019s rate policy from 2022 to 2024 marks a dramatic swing between aggressive hikes and easing measures. In 2022 and 2023, they raised rates at an unprecedented pace to cool the economy after supply chain issues and high consumer demand. By late 2023, rampant inflation showed signs of easing.\u00a0\nThen, at their meeting on September 18th, 2024, they enacted their first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic\u201450 basis points to help the weak labor market.\u00a0\nBy cutting rates in 2024, the Fed addressed concerns about slow economic growth, as well as rising unemployment. To prevent further deterioration of job gains and rising unemployment rates, the Fed aims to make borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments and spending, which can help create more jobs and stimulate the economy while keeping inflation manageable.\n2019-2020: Fed rate cuts\nGoing into 2020, the Fed cut rates to help stimulate the economy amidst global uncertainty. The end of 2019 marked concerns about trade tensions, with slow global growth and muted inflation, which prompted them to cut rates. But then the pandemic hit, causing them to shift from caution to emergency action. When the world shut down in March of 2020, in an unprecedented move to support the economy, the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero.\u00a0\nPaired with quantitative easing to mitigate any economic fallout once businesses started boarding up and unemployment soared, the Fed's actions were designed to flood the financial system with liquidity and encourage borrowing and spending. Cutting rates to almost zero, businesses could borrow for much cheaper than before, and allowed for consumers to finance large purchases.\u00a0\n2015-2018: Fed rate hikes\nIn the wake of near-zero rates after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since 2006. They were confident the US economy was starting to recover, thanks to steady job growth and more consumer spending. While these rate hikes were modest, they were scant for a reason: After years of extraordinary measures, they wanted to normalize the monetary policy. Then, by 2018, they'd raised the rates four times as the economy strengthened.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, a volatile market led to a more cautious stance by the Fed as trade tensions and slow global growth raised concerns about the sustainability of the economic expansion. Worried that the rate hikes could stifle any growth and propel the US into a deeper economic dive, they hit pause on tightening the economy.\n2007-2008: Fed rate cuts\nFinancial markets unraveled when the housing bubble burst, causing the Fed to make sharp rate cuts in 2007 and 2008. These were supposed to help cushion the U.S. economy amid the subprime mortgage crisis, but the response was a full-blown global financial meltdown.\u00a0\nThe Fed brought rates to near zero after cutting them from over 5% by the end of 2008. Amid bailouts and emergency lending to stabilize banks, they sought to prevent a deeper economic collapse. This period became known as The Great Recession.\u00a0\u00a0\n2005-2006: Fed rate hikes\nTo prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates in the mid-2000s. The economy was expanding and housing prices were surging, so the Fed made a series of rate hikes from 2005 to 2006. With potential speculation in the housing market and increasing inflation, the Fed sought to curb excessive borrowing and prevent the formation of asset bubbles by steadily raising interest rates. By December 2005, they'd raised rates for 13 straight times.\nThis made borrowing more expensive, which cooled the housing market and brought rising prices under control during this period of economic instability that ran rampant with unchecked inflation and speculative activity.\u00a0\n2001-2003: Fed rate cuts\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Reserve had a lot to contend with\u2014the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the aftermath of September 11th. From 2001 to 2003, the Fed made a series of rate cuts to help stimulate an economy rocked by back-to-back crises. They slashed rates from 6.5% to 1% during this period to support growth and encourage more borrowing and investments. In 2001 alone, they cut rates 11 times.\nWhile these extended periods of rate cuts helped the economic slowdown, they also contributed to the eventual housing market bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008.\n1999-2000: Fed rate hikes\nWith a growing technology sector and booming economic growth, the Fed raised rates in 1999 and 2000. This helped to control inflation, especially as tech stocks experienced rapid growth. They raised rates five times between 1999 and 2000 to prevent overheating the economy. However, with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the following economic downturn, they shifted to cutting rates shortly afterward.\n1998: Fed rate cuts\nWith growing concerns over the global financial system, the Fed made a series of rate cuts in 1998. A major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, collapsed around the same time as serious instability in worldwide markets, influenced by the Asian financial crisis. The Fed's aim was to prevent the US from sinking into a recession. Totaling 75 basis points, the three rate cuts helped stabilize the markets.\nThe Fed made these cuts to encourage borrowing and investments, and by the end of 1998, the economy was relatively strong despite what was happening in external markets. However, some economists suggest that this period of extended rate cuts helped contribute to the dot-com bubble bust in the following years.\n1997: Fed rate hike\nIn 1997, the Fed raised rates in response to strong economic growth and a tightening labor market. Unemployment fell to historic lows, and when inflationary pressure increased, the Fed hiked rates to prevent overheating the economy. While they wanted to keep the stock market rising and bolster the ongoing expansion, the Fed also had to keep inflation in check.\u00a0\nThey made just one rate increase in 1997 to maintain price stability and consumer confidence. Throughout the decade, they were careful to balance growth and inflationary pressures.\n1995-1996: Fed rate cuts\nThe U.S. saw an economic expansion following the 1990s recession, so the Fed cut rates in 1995 and 1996. Earlier in the decade, the Fed grew concerned that the economy was slowing, partly due to reduced inflationary pressure. They wanted to encourage borrowing and investing so the economy could expand even further. These cuts kept inflation under control and helped reignite growth.\nThis ushered the economy into continued prosperity in the late 1990s, thanks to steady growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. However, critics argue that these low rates led to riskier financial markets that led to the dot-com bubble.\n1994-1995: Fed rate hikes\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve went on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 1994. With rapid economic expansion and more inflationary pressure, the federal funds rate jumped from 3% to 6% between February 1994 and February 1995. This was to prevent the economy from overheating and curb inflation, especially as wages increased and the labor market tightened.\nWhile these hikes controlled inflation, they also slowed the economy down, especially as sectors like housing and manufacturing, which are more sensitive to interest rates, saw reduced demand due to higher borrowing costs. These made loans more expensive, so home sales dropped and industrial production slowed, leading to even more economic deceleration. By early 1995, the Fed paused these rate increases to help maintain long-term stability, which fueled the expansion in the late 1990s.\n1990-1992: Fed rate cuts\nA recession began in 1990, and to stimulate the economy, the Fed made a series of rate cuts. The savings and loan crisis, Gulf War oil prices, and slowing consumer spending combined to trigger this recession. The Fed brought the federal funds rate from 8% to 3% over a two-year period to help encourage borrowing and investing in a sluggish economy.\nThis laid the groundwork for the economic recovery experienced by the mid-90s, as it was cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow, so they were encouraged to spend more. Industries reliant on consumer credit, such as the real estate market, benefited from these lower rates. This gradual economic recovery took some time to come to fruition, though many agree the Fed's actions helped prevent a deeper, more prolonged recession.\nThe takeaway\nThe federal fund rate's history shows the tough balancing act that the Fed employs to sustain economic growth while controlling inflation. During periods of rapid growth, rate hikes help curb inflation, while during economic slowdowns, rate cuts help stimulate borrowing.\u00a0\nAs a consumer and investor, knowing when and why the Federal Reserve makes adjustments to the federal funds rates can help you decide when to borrow, invest, and save. For example, if rates are high, you might want to wait to refinance your mortgage, but it might be an excellent time to stash some cash in a high-yield savings account or CD.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\nThe Federal Reserve oversees the United States' monetary policy as the central banking system. It regulates financial institutions, works to maintain economic stability, and manages the nation's money supply.\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\nThe Federal Reserve controls interest rates, works to keep inflation in check, and tries to stabilize the financial system. It also supervises banks, provides financial services to the US government, and is a lender during financial crises.\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\nThe Federal Reserve was formed in 1913 to provide a more stable banking system and to help stem financial panics like the one that caused the Panic of 1907. This saw widespread bank runs and deteriorated confidence in the economic system. This central authority to manage monetary policy and give emergency support to banks helped create a more resilient financial environment.\nRead more\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach.

He received his M.A. in journalism from The New School and his B.A. in history and political science from McGill University.\nLearn about our editorial policies\nPublished September 30, 2024\n02:57 PM EDT\n\nStephanie Keith / Getty Images\nKey Takeaways\n\nStocks this year have had their best first three quarters of the 21st century, with the S&P 500 up more than 20%.\nWall Street will be focused on labor market data and how it could impact future Federal Reserve rate cuts.\nStocks tend to rise when the Fed cuts rates outside of a recession, though experts warn the upcoming U.S. presidential election and geopolitical risks threaten to increase near-term volatility.\n\nStocks defied the odds in September, ticking up to trade at record highs despite the month's reputation as a notoriously rough patch for equities. Thanks to September's gains, the S&P 500 has posted its strongest first three quarters of the 21st century.\nEquities were given a lift this month by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates\u2014by 50 basis points\u2014for the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart.\nThe fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts\u2014despite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility\u2014are broadly optimistic about the outlook.\nThe Labor Market in Focus\nAs in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed.\nInitial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. \"These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession,\" they say.\nInitial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000.\nFed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios.\nSoft Landing Seen Good for Stocks\nThe consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks.\nAs of late September, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter.\nSix of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens.\nConventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions.\nAt the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers.\nThe S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow.\nThe Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations.\nPolitics Could Stoke Volatility\nPolitical developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don\u2019t fundamentally change the economic or business outlook.\nThe presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses.\nConflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets.\nExperts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

the WhoScored rating algorithm. The algorithm is their own, but the stats the rating is based on are sourced straight from Opta.\nOpta review their stats after each game, so the rating is also subject to change for a day or so after the match.\nFor matches that WhoScored does not cover, the ratings and stats from either SofaScore or FotMob are used instead.\nAgain, both SofaScore and FotMob are powered by Opta stats. The only difference with SofaScore is that their key pass stats also include Opta's \"Second Assist\" in addition to passes that lead to shots. The definition for this is \"a pass that creates an opportunity for another player to assist a goal\", however this is a relatively rare occurrence.\n\u00a9 2024 Messi vs Ronaldo | Illustrations by Denis Davydov | Contact | Privacy Policy\nTop Scorers Club\n",

It's nearly impossible to imagine any other male player ever reaching this incredible feat.\u00a0\nFrom his early days at Sporting CP to his stints with Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, and currently Al Nassr, Ronaldo's career has been nothing short of legendary. His accolades include five Ballon d'Or awards, numerous titles across three of Europe's top five leagues, and five UEFA Champions League trophies.\nPart of Portugal's winning Euro 2016 side, Ronaldo also boasts the record for most international goals scored by a male player and is the only man to have played more than 200 games for his senior national team.\nOn September 5, 2024, Ronaldo struck his historic 900th goal, meeting a pinpoint cross from the left from Nuno Mendes before turning the ball home from close range, doubling Portugal's lead against Croatia in the UEFA Nations League. He was clearly emotional as he celebrated the famous moment.\nCristiano Ronaldo was emotional after scoring his 900th goal of his career \ud83e\udd79\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/yVfDJYS0Ih\nThe Sporting News takes a look back at seven of Ronaldo's greatest goals of all time.\u00a0\nMORE: When will Cristiano Ronaldo retire?\u00a0| The leading goal-scorers in men's football history\nCristiano Ronaldo 900 goals: Best CR7 career strikes\nIn celebration of Ronaldo's achievement and his iconic No. 7\u00a0 jersey, we revisit seven of his greatest goals from his 900 \u2014 a fitting tribute to a player synonymous with sustained excellence while wearing one of the sport's most esteemed shirt numbers.\n900 GOALS \ud83d\ude31Cristiano Ronaldo becomes the first soccer player with 900 career goals. pic.twitter.com/nWBbCr8zKK\nManchester United vs. PortsmouthDate: January 30, 2008 \u00a0\nRonaldo scored this famous free-kick from around 30 yards out in a Premier League match against Portsmouth.

And, it was nice to actually get a win.\u201d\n Andrew Wiggins had a big role in that, turning in another strong game with 20 points, eight rebounds and eight assists.\n Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points for the Warriors, who are in 10th place in the Western Conference standings and battling the Houston Rockets for a spot in the play-in tournament. The Rockets won their 11th straight, 101-100 over the Utah Jazz on Friday night and are a game behind the Warriors.\n Fred VanVleet had 22 points, Amen Thompson added 18 points and 14 rebounds while Jabari Smith, Jr. scored 14 points for the Rocke\n              Warriors coach Steve Kerr said that is a reflection of just how tough the West is this season.\n              \u201cWe had a similar record last year and we were the sixth seed,\u201d Kerr said.\n              Golden State limited Charlotte to 41% shooting and held its third straight opponent to fewer than 100 points.\n              \u201cI feel like we are starting out the game engaged on the floor and talking, and that has carried over,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n Miles Bridges had 22 points and nine rebounds to lead Charlotte, which failed in its bid to win back-to-back games for the first time since the All-Star break.\n              Curry always packs the Spectrum Center and Friday night was no exception.\n              With his brother Seth and father Dell looking on, Curry finished the game 9 of 18 from the field. Seth plays for Charlotte but is out with an ankle injury, while Dell is a broadcaster for the Hornets.\n              Curry admitted there has always been a \"curiosity\" about playing for the Hornets, where his father was a star but said his intentions are to remain in the Bay Area.\n              Charlotte rookie Brandon Miller briefly left the game with 8 1/2 minutes left after his leg got tangled up with Draymond Green while going for a rebound. He had just 12 points after making a career-high seven 3s and scoring 31 points on Monday night.\n              Green, who was ejected from the Warriors last game against Orlando, was later whistled for a foul when he appeared to push Charlotte\u2019s Grant Williams to the ground. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but the play was upheld.\n              The Warriors had no problems scoring against the Hornets, repeatedly taking advantage of breakdowns by Charlotte\u2019s defense, finding wide open players underneath the basket on three different occasions.\n              \u201cTrayce (Jackson-Davis) did a great job on the boards today, gave them second opportunities, and with the Warriors, you can\u2019t do that with everybody on their team who can shoot,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cThey were making shots, they were cutting hard and they were getting second-chance points.\u201d \n              The Warriors played without Klay Thompson, who sat out with tendinitis in his right knee.\n Chris Paul got the start in his place and had 11 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, including a lob over three players to Jackson-Davis for a dunk.\n              Jackson-Davis said Paul thought he threw the ball over his head.\n              \u201cI had some sneaky bunnies and I went up and got it,\u201d Jackson-Davis said. \n              UP NEXT\n              Warriors: Visit Spurs on Sunday night.\n              Hornets: Host Clippers on Sunday night.\n              ----\n              AP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba\nRegular Season Series\nGame Information\n2024-25 Pacific Standings\n2024-25 Southeast Standings\nNBA News\nToronto takes on Charlotte for conference matchup\nWashington takes on conference foe Atlanta\nPhiladelphia and Detroit square off in conference showdown\n",
      "2024 Golden State Warriors Playoffs Picture after loss vs Minnesota Timberwolves: Updated standings, schedule and\u00a0more\u00a0(March\u00a024)\nThe Golden State Warriors (36-33) faced a significant challenge as they clashed with the Minnesota Timberwolves (48-22) on Sunday night. With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime. Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga also made significant contributions with 11 points each in the first half.\nExplore the NBA Draft 2024 with our free NBA Mock Draft Simulator & be the GM of your favorite NBA team.\nIn the third quarter, the Timberwolves mounted a comeback, narrowing the gap to three points with a score of 81-78. Mike Conley led Minnesota's resurgence with six points, while Nickeil Alexander-Walker also chipped in six points in the Timberwolves rally.\nDespite Minnesota's efforts, Steph Curry led the charge to maintain Golden State's lead, adding eight points in the quarter. Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory. Anthony Edwards played a pivotal role in Minnesota's win, contributing 23 points, eight assists, and six rebounds. Rudy Gobert and Naz Reid delivered double-double performances to aid Edwards in securing the victory.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Updated Standings\nAfter suffering from a loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves, the Golden State Warriors now have a 36-34 record. While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference. Winning those two games would keep their Play-In Tournament hopes alive.\nTimberwolves Nation!

      "2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule\nSchedule of Games Played for the 2024 Boston Red Sox | Baseball Almanac\n\"The 2024 Boston Red Sox, a blend of youth and experience, is a team to watch. The management is hopeful about extending contracts to its young stars, indicating a commitment to nurturing talent. However, the team has faced criticism, with players like Jordan Montgomery reportedly preferring teams with stronger winning prospects. Despite this, the Red Sox have a robust roster, including promising players like Brayan Bello and Isaiah Campbell. The team's performance in the opening game, a 6\u00964 victory of the Seattle Mariners, was noteworthy. Manager Alex Cora sees the team as 'a lot younger, very athletic,' but acknowledges the essential roles of key veterans. As the season unfolds, the Red Sox will strive to strike a balance between youth and experience, aiming to prove their critics wrong and their supporters right. The 2024 season is shaping up to be an exciting one for the Boston Red Sox.\" - Baseball Almanac.\n2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Official Logo\n2023 \u2190 Complete Schedule for the 2024 Boston Red Sox\n2024 Boston Red Sox Schedule | Research by Baseball Almanac\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2024 Boston Red Sox home / road splits for the 2024 regular season were 38-43 (0.469 winning percentage) at home and 43-38 (0.531 winning percentage) on the road.\nDid you know that the 2024 Boston Red Sox were 15-11 during the month of June?
