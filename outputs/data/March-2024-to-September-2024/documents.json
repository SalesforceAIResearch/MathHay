He expects a bottom line for the three months ended in July of 67 cents a share on revenue of $30 billion.\nWall Street forecasts are pointing to a consensus bottom line of 64 cents a share a 137% increase from the last year, with revenues more than doubling to $28.55 billion.\nNvidia told investors in May that current-quarter revenue would rise to around $28 billion, at the time stronger-than-expected estimate assuaged investors' concern about delays for orders of H100 chips tied to the launch of its new Blackwell processors.\nRelated: Goldman Sachs analyst revisits Nvidia stock price target ahead of earnings\nInvestors will focus on reports that delivery of its newly launched line of Blackwell processors, which are meant to be faster, cheaper, and more efficient than its H100 Hopper predecessors, could be delayed due to design flaws.\nAnalysts had forecast Blackwell to start contributing to Nvidia's top-line growth in the third quarter and find their way into global customer data centers by the year's final three months.\nHyperscalers poised to spend big on infrastructure\nThat demand, as well as Nvidia's commanding market share, is predicted to drive the group's data center revenue as high as $150 billion next year, powered largely by this year's Blackwell launch.\nHyperscalers, the major providers of massive data centers and cloud services, are poised to spend around $500 billion over the next two years building out their massive infrastructure, according to estimates from Barclays.\nThe goal is to leverage their massive datasets to enhance sales of everything from drive-through dining to the most complicated pharmaceutical testing.\nStill, some analysts are also starting to question the pace of AI spending from hyperscalers such as Microsoft\u00a0 (MSFT) , Meta Platforms\u00a0 (META) , Amazon\u00a0 (AMZN) , and Google parent Alphabet\u00a0 (GOOGL) \u00a0and the resultant demand for the high-end chips and processors produced by Nvidia.\nRelated: Big names exit Nvidia stock as AI giant stumbles before earnings\nIves at Wedbush says Nvidia's near-term outlook will be crucial for the direction of broader tech stocks, who estimates that \"for every $1 spent on an Nvidia GPU chip there is a $8-$10 multiplier across the sector.\"\nMore AI Stocks:\nAnalyst revisits Microsoft stock price target after AI reporting change\nAnalyst resets Nvidia stock price target before earnings\nAnalysts revise Palo Alto Networks stock price targets after earnings\n\"The stage is set for tech stocks to move higher into year-end and 2025 ... as the Fed gets in position to start its rate cutting cycle, macro soft landing remains the path, and tech spending on AI remains a generational spending cycle just starting to hit the shores of the tech sector,\" Ives said.\nNvidia shares were marked 4.7% higher in early Friday trading to change hands at $129.48, a move that would extend the stock's six-month gain to around 65%.\nRelated: Veteran fund manager sees world of pain coming for stocks\nSign in to access your portfolio",
    "Summarized_document": "Nvidia shares rose in Friday trading as investors anticipated the company's crucial second-quarter earnings report. A top Wall Street analyst issued a positive outlook on Nvidia's impact on the broader tech market. Nvidia, which will report earnings next week, has rebounded significantly, adding over $600 billion in market value since early August. This momentum is crucial for market sentiment, especially as investors question AI-related investments and the recent underperformance of major tech stocks. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives highlighted the importance of Nvidia's earnings, noting the company's unique position to discuss enterprise AI demand and the future of its AI chips. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson increased his Nvidia price target by $18 to $138 per share, maintaining an 'overweight' rating. Bryson expects strong second-quarter results and robust third-quarter guidance, predicting earnings of 67 cents per share on $30 billion in revenue. Wall Street forecasts a consensus of 64 cents per share, a 137% increase from last year, with revenues more than doubling to $28.55 billion. Nvidia previously projected current-quarter revenue to rise to around $28 billion, easing concerns about delays in H100 chip orders linked to its new Blackwell processors. Investors are focused on potential delays in Blackwell processor deliveries due to design flaws. Analysts expected Blackwell to contribute to Nvidia's growth in the third quarter and enter global data centers by year-end. Hyperscalers, major data center and cloud service providers, are expected to spend $500 billion over the next two years on infrastructure, driven by Nvidia's market share and Blackwell launch. However, some analysts question the pace of AI spending by companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Alphabet, and the demand for Nvidia's high-end chips. Ives emphasized Nvidia's near-term outlook as crucial for tech stocks, estimating a $8-$10 multiplier for every $1 spent on Nvidia GPU chips. Nvidia shares rose 4.7% in early Friday trading to $129.48, extending a six-month gain to around 65%."

The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security.\nAs of today (2024-10-29), Tesla's Volatility is 53.17%.\nCompetitive Comparison of Tesla's  Volatility\nFor the Auto Manufacturers subindustry, Tesla's Volatility, along with its competitors' market caps and Volatility data, can be viewed below:\n* Competitive companies are chosen from companies within the same industry, with headquarter located in same country, with closest market capitalization; x-axis shows the market cap, and y-axis shows the term value; the bigger the dot, the larger the market cap. Note that \"N/A\" values will not show up in the chart.\nTesla's  Volatility Distribution in the Vehicles & Parts Industry\nFor the Vehicles & Parts industry and Consumer Cyclical sector, Tesla's Volatility distribution charts can be found below:\n* The bar in red indicates where Tesla's Volatility falls into.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Calculation\nThe annualized volatility is calculated as following:\nWhere: \u03c3M is the monthly volatility, n is the number of months in the period, Ri is the security's historical monthly returns and R' is the arithmetic mean of monthly returns.\n* For Operating Data section: All numbers are indicated by the unit behind each term and all currency related amount are in USD. * For other sections: All numbers are in millions except for per share data, ratio, and percentage. All currency related amount are indicated in the company's associated stock exchange currency.\nTesla\u00a0\u00a0(NAS:TSLA)   Volatility Explanation\nVolatility is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. It\u2019s often measured as standard deviation or variance of historical returns over a certain period. The volatility here is measured as the annualized standard deviation between monthly returns from the security over the past year.\nVolatility reflects the uncertainty or risk of a security\u2019s value. Generally speaking, a higher volatility suggests a higher risk, because it implies a wider fluctuation around average price. This means the price of the security can change dramatically in either direction within a short period. Conversely, a lower volatility means that the security's price is more steady, which suggests a lower risk.\nAnother measurement of relative volatility is Beta. Beta is a measure of systematic risk of a security or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is usually compared to 1. A beta of greater than 1 indicates that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.\nTesla Volatility Related Terms\nThank you for viewing the detailed overview of Tesla's Volatility provided by GuruFocus.com.

To that point, TSLA is still up +14% in the last three months to outperform the S&P 500\u2019s +1% and the Nasdaq\u2019s +2%.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nRecent Performance Overview\nTesla\u2019s stock has stayed in correction territory following its Q2 earnings of $0.52 a share which decreased -43% from EPS of $0.91 in the comparative quarter. This also missed Q2 EPS estimates of $0.62 by -16%.\nQuarterly sales did reach a record of $25.5 billion which was a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023 and beat expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its EV fleet led to lower margins with CEO Elon Musk stating an increasing number of competitors have entered the market and offered substantial discounts in an attempt to undercut Tesla.\nThe auto giant does see this as a short-term headwind with annual earnings now expected to decline -26% this year but projected to rebound and climb 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\u00a0\u00a0\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe Technical Tape & Valuation\nUnderlying the recent bearish move in Tesla\u2019s stock is that TSLA moved below its 50-day\u00a0simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and continued to fall after dipping beneath its\u00a0200-day\u00a0SMA of $201. Traders will certainly want to see TSLA retake these levels.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nHowever, the correction has helped to normalize Tesla\u2019s valuation with TSLA trading at 87.1X forward earnings which is 38% below its two-year high of 141.2X and closer to the median of 76.7X during this period.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nBottom Line\nTesla\u2019s stock currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The EV pioneer's long-term outlook is still attractive but TSLA remains in correction territory and there could be better buying opportunities ahead. That said, the leveling of Tesla\u2019s valuation should start to attract more investors.\nSee More Zacks Research for These Tickers\nNormally $25 each - click below to receive one report FREE:\nTesla, Inc.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.

Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

    "Summarized_document": "Tesla's stock has recently experienced a decline, falling below $200 per share, marking a 20% drop over the last month. This decline follows a previous rise towards its 52-week high of $278.98 in September. The downturn was exacerbated by an underwhelming Q2 report in July and subsequent market volatility. Despite this, Tesla's stock has outperformed broader indexes, with a 14% increase over the last three months compared to the S&P 500's 1% and Nasdaq's 2% gains.\n\nIn Q2, Tesla reported earnings of $0.52 per share, a 43% decrease from $0.91 in the same quarter last year, missing the EPS estimate of $0.62 by 16%. However, quarterly sales reached a record $25.5 billion, a 2% increase from $24.92 billion in Q2 2023, surpassing expectations by 1%. Price cuts to its electric vehicle fleet have led to lower margins, with CEO Elon Musk noting increased competition and substantial discounts from rivals. Tesla views this as a short-term challenge, with annual earnings expected to decline by 26% this year but projected to rebound by 36% in fiscal 2025 to $3.14 per share.\n\nTechnically, Tesla's stock has moved below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $209 and its 200-day SMA of $201, which traders will be watching closely. The correction has helped normalize Tesla's valuation, with the stock trading at 87.1 times forward earnings, 38% below its two-year high of 141.2 times, and closer to the median of 76.7 times during this period.\n\nCurrently, Tesla holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). While the long-term outlook remains positive, the stock is still in correction territory, suggesting potential better buying opportunities in the future. The adjustment in Tesla's valuation may start to attract more investors.\n\nZacks Investment Research emphasizes its commitment to independent research and sharing profitable discoveries with investors. The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, established in 1988, has historically outperformed the S&P 500 with an average annual gain of 24.10%. This system's returns are calculated monthly, based on Zacks Rank stock prices and dividends, and are compounded to determine annual returns. Zacks Rank stocks included in hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are used in these calculations, with some exclusions for unavailable pricing information or other reasons."

Though hiring has slowed\u2014average payroll gains over the past three months were 116,000\u2014the U.S. job market continues to generate solid job gains and wage growth that is consistently beating inflation.\nFor more details on today\u2019s report, see CEA\u2019s X thread.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nAt 4.2% the unemployment rate, while still low, is up half-a-point from the beginning of the year. What\u2019s behind this increase? There is no single, simple answer, but one factor behind the July increase was so-called temporary unemployment. The dynamics of unemployment over the past two months are a reminder that temporary unemployment has a less-persistent impact on the unemployment rate relative to more permanent layoffs.\nWorkers get labeled as temporarily unemployed when they aren\u2019t working, but say that they expect to be recalled to their prior employer sometime in the near future. Typically, this is a small fraction of unemployment\u2014on average 13% from 2016\u201319\u2014 with an exception being Spring and Summer 2020, when many Americans were in this position because of the pandemic. (See Figure 1.)\nIn July, temporary unemployment rose by 250,000\u2014the large majority of the overall 350,000 rise in unemployment that month. It\u2019s hard to say what caused this (it doesn\u2019t appear to be related to a hurricane), but what we know is that temporarily unemployed workers are much more likely to quickly regain employment than other unemployed workers. Over the last year, 52% of the temporarily unemployed were re-employed in the next month, and only 3% become permanent job losers (i.e., those who are involuntarily unemployed without expectation of recall to their prior employer). Indeed, this is consistent with what we saw in this morning\u2019s data for August: temporary unemployment fell back by 190,000, putting downward pressure on the overall unemployment rate.\nEven with the tick down in August\u2019s unemployment rate, it is still up from a low of 3.4% in April of last year. Some economists view this as a cause for concern because\u2014historically speaking\u2014when the unemployment rate goes up this much, it tends to keep rising.[1]\nBut there are reasons why that historical experience may not hold true in today\u2019s labor market, especially when we consider this indicator in the context of many other positive economic developments, like strong consumer spending and GDP growth (more on those in a moment).\nOne reason relates to the unusual situation of mid-2023, when the unemployment rate was at its minimum. The U.S. labor market was recovering from an unprecedented pandemic-induced recession with the aid of similarly unprecedented fiscal policy support. This drove the unemployment rate down to a level it had not reached since the beginning of the Nixon Administration. We have little relevant guidance from past experience with unemployment rising from such a low level.\nTo see this point, consider the behavior of unemployment insurance claims just last year. Before 2023, high year-over-year growth in continuing claims (i.e., the number of unemployment insurance recipients, roughly speaking) was almost always associated with a recession. (See Figure 2.) But even though that growth rate rose to about 30% in mid-2023\u2014a rate typically indicative of recession\u2014the crucial context was that mid-2022 continuing claims had been historically low due to a combination of the tight labor market and the hangover from the pandemic. As such, simply returning to a normal level meant big increases from that low baseline. And as we have seen since mid-2023, the rise in continued claims last summer was clearly not associated with a recession.\nStepping back from the details of unemployment, most indicators of economic vitality remain strong as we close out summer 2024. While payroll employment growth has cooled, it remains positive and consistent with a stable labor market providing ample opportunities to job seekers. Yearly wage growth was 3.8% in August and 4.1% for lower- and middle-wage workers. While we do not yet know inflation for August, it is extremely likely that these wage-growth rates add another month to the 15-month tally of wage growth outpacing price growth through July, meaning real wage gains.\nInitial and continuing claims for unemployment insurance remain relatively low and similar to their pre-pandemic levels. And at 83.9%, prime-age labor force participation is just below its highest level in more than twenty years.\nTurning to other, related measures of economic activity, real GDP is on very solid footing, driven by strong consumer spending (itself supported by the real wage gains just noted) and a positive trend in business investment. Reflecting this optimistic outlook, small business creation has been setting records in recent years.\nIn other words, today\u2019s jobs report along with a broad array of economic data are consistent with steady growth, easing inflationary pressures, real wage and income gains, and no notable recent increase in permanent layoffs. CEA will continue to monitor and contextualize these trends, as we work with the Biden-Harris team to maintain and build on this progress on behalf of American families.\n[1] The commonly used Sahm Indicator captures this tendency: it is calculated as the difference between the current unemployment rate and the unemployment rate minimum over the preceding twelve months (where all rates are calculated as their three-month trailing averages).\nStay Connected\nWe'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOpt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe White House\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWashington, DC 20500\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "Summarized_document": "The recent report on the U.S. job market shows a rise in payroll employment by 142,000 and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate from 4.3% to 4.2%. Despite a slowdown in hiring, with average payroll gains of 116,000 over the past three months, the job market remains robust, with wage growth outpacing inflation. The unemployment rate, although low, has increased by half a point since the start of the year, largely due to a rise in temporary unemployment, which increased by 250,000 in July. Temporary unemployment typically has a less persistent impact on the overall unemployment rate, as these workers are often quickly re-employed. In August, temporary unemployment decreased by 190,000, contributing to a reduction in the overall unemployment rate.\n\nThe current unemployment rate of 4.2% is up from a low of 3.4% in April of the previous year. Some economists express concern over this increase, as historically, such a rise tends to continue. However, the current labor market conditions differ from past experiences, particularly due to the unique recovery from the pandemic-induced recession and significant fiscal policy support. This context suggests that the historical pattern may not apply.\n\nUnemployment insurance claims, which typically indicate recession when they grow significantly, rose by about 30% in mid-2023. However, this increase was from a historically low baseline, and the rise was not associated with a recession. As of summer 2024, most economic indicators remain strong. Payroll employment growth, though slower, is stable, and wage growth continues to outpace inflation, with yearly wage growth at 3.8% in August and 4.1% for lower- and middle-wage workers.\n\nInitial and continuing claims for unemployment insurance are low, and prime-age labor force participation is near its highest level in over twenty years at 83.9%. Real GDP is solid, driven by strong consumer spending and positive business investment trends. Small business creation is also at record levels, reflecting an optimistic economic outlook.\n\nOverall, the current economic data suggests steady growth, easing inflationary pressures, real wage and income gains, and no significant increase in permanent layoffs. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) will continue to monitor these trends to support the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to maintain and build on this progress for American families."

History Says the Stock Market Will Do This Next.\nKey Points\n\nSNPINDEX: ^GSPC\n\nS&P 500 Index\nThe stock market had an unexpectedly good September, and momentum could carry the S&P 500 higher in the fourth quarter.\nSeptember has historically been the weakest month of the year for the U.S. stock market. In the last two decades, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.27%) has declined by an average of 0.6% during September, which is a half-percentage point worse than the next closest month.\nThat inexplicable phenomenon, aptly known as the \"September Effect,\" failed to materialize this year. Instead, the S&P 500 advanced 2% to clench its best September since 2013. And history says that momentum spill into the remaining months of 2024.\nHere's what investors should know.\nHistory says the S&P 500 is headed higher in the remaining months of 2024\nThe U.S. stock market's unexpectedly strong September was a product of solid financial results and interest rate cuts. Specifically, S&P 500 companies recorded earnings growth of 11.3% in the second quarter of 2024, the best performance since the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time in four years. Lower rates should strengthen the economy by encouraging consumer spending and business investments, which itself should drive continued strength in corporate earnings.\nEnthusiasm born of those events pushed the S&P 500 higher in September, something that has happened only 11 other times in the last two decades. The chart below shows how the index performed over the three-month and 12-month periods following positive Septembers in the past.\nYear\n3-Month Return\n12-Month Return\n2004\n9%\n10%\n2005\n2%\n9%\n2006\n6%\n14%\n2007\n(4%)\n(24%)\n2009\n5%\n(26%)\n2010\n10%\n(1%)\n2012\n(1%)\n17%\n2013\n10%\n17%\n2017\n(1%)\n16%\n2018\n(14%)\n2%\n2019\n9%\n13%\nMedian\n5%\n10%\nData source: YCharts. The chart shows the S&P 500's performance during the three-month period and 12-month period following a positive return in September of the listed year.\nAs shown above, during the last two decades, the S&P 500 has achieved a median three-month return of 5% and a median 12-month return of 10% following a positive result in September. We can use that information to make an educated guess about the current situation.\nSpecifically, the S&P 500 has fallen 1% since the end of September. That leaves implied upside of 6% over the next three months and 11% over the next 12 months. Past performance is never a guarantee of future results, but those predictions are very plausible.\nThe fourth quarter has historically been the strongest quarter of the year for the stock market due to the expectation that holiday spending will help the economy. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 4.3% in the fourth quarter, more than doubling its performance in the next best quarter, according to Carson Group.\nAdditionally, the S&P 500 advanced 193% in the last decade, excluding dividends. That equates to 11.3% annually. So, an 11% return during the next 12-month period that ends in September 2025 would actually qualify as below average. Regardless, investors should be cautious in the current market environment.\nThe S&P 500 could be derailed by historically expensive stock prices\nMany stocks are expensive by historical standards. The S&P 500 trades at 27 times earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 23.8 times earnings and the 10-year average of 21.7 times earnings. As a result, several Wall Street strategists expect the S&P 500 to decline in the remaining months of 2024.\nThe chart below lists Wall Street's year-end price targets for the S&P 500. It also shows the implied upside or downside (compared to its current level of 5,710) associated with each forecast.\nWall Street Firm\nS&P 500 Year-End Target\nImplied Upside (Downside)\nBMO Capital Markets\n6,100\n7%\nEvercore\n6,000\n5%\nOppenheimer\n5,900\n3%\nYardeni Research\n5,800\n2%\nDeutsche Bank\n5,750\n1%\nRBC Capital\n5,700\n0%\nUBS\n5,600\n(2%)\nCiti\n5,600\n(2%)\nGoldman Sachs\n5,600\n(2%)\nBarclays\n5,600\n(2%)\nWells Fargo\n5,535\n(3%)\nBank of America\n5,400\n(5%)\nFundstrat\n5,200\n(9%)\nJPMorgan Chase\n4,200\n(26%)\nMedian\n5,200\n(2%)\nData source: Yahoo Finance.\nAs shown above, Wall Street's year-end targets for the S&P 500 imply outcomes ranging from 7% upside to 26% downside in the remaining months of 2024. But the median forecast of 5,600 implies 2% downside.\nHere's the bottom line: History says the S&P 500 will have a strong fourth quarter. But stocks are historically expensive, so the first sign of economic trouble could trigger a market correction or even a bear market. So, investors should be particularly cognizant of valuations when buying stocks in the current environment.\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Katherine holds an MBA, and is a former staff writer for Fit Small Business. She is a regular contributor to Forbes and maintains a popular lifestyle and travel blog.\nAbigail Rueger is a deputy editor on the banking team at Fortune Recommends. She is passionate about personal finance and offering consumers actionable steps for making positive life changes. Prior to joining Fortune, Abigail spent four years as an editor for Choosing Therapy, a startup dedicated to providing the best mental health information on the web.\u00a0\nSet by the Federal Reserve\u2014or the \u2018Fed\u2019\u2014the federal funds rate helps stabilize the economy during growth and recession. In recent decades, the Fed\u2019s choice to raise or lower rates has been in response to major events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial crisis of 2008. \nKnowing how and why the Fed changes these rates can help you better understand how their decisions affect everyday Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nUnderstanding Fed Interest Rate Decisions\nThink of the federal fund rate as a thermostat for the economy. When the economy begins to overheat\u2014shown by rising inflation and unsustainable growth\u2014the Fed raises the \u2018temperature\u2019 by increasing interest rates, making borrowing more expensive. \nConversely, during a recession, or when the economy starts to \u2018freeze,\u2019 the Fed lowers the thermostat by cutting rates, encouraging borrowing and spending to help warm things back up.\u00a0\nThe federal funds rate helps maintain the economy\u2019s \u2018temperature\u2019\u2014not too hot, not too cold. It influences everything from mortgage rates to consumer spending.\nExpert insight\n\u201cThe Fed\u2019s moves have a direct impact on consumers and businesses. When rates rise, borrowing costs go up, meaning your mortgage, car loan, credit card debt, and business debt can become more expensive. On the flip side, lower rates make it cheaper to borrow, which can help with big purchases like homes, cars, and business expansion.But it\u2019s not all bad news when rates go up\u2014savers benefit from higher returns on cash in savings accounts, CDs, and bonds, allowing their money to earn more interest. Whether you\u2019re borrowing or saving, Fed rate changes ripple through the economy and affect your financial well-being in a number of ways.\u201d \u2013 Andrew Tudor, CFP, CAP \u2013 Investment Advisor\nDrawbacks of interest rate decisions by the Fed\nThe Fed\u2019s policies, though aimed at stabilizing the broader economy, often have unintended side effects. Jason Ray, president and chief information officer (CIO) of Zenith Wealth Partners, says, \u201cWhile necessary, the Fed\u2019s actions often disproportionately benefit financial markets and asset holders, raising questions about long-term wealth inequality under its policies. \nThe Fed\u2019s balancing act often amplifies existing socioeconomic divides, especially when rate changes disproportionately impact borrowers or savers across different income levels. Is the focus on employment and inflation inadvertently deepening these structural inequalities?\u201d\nWhat impacts the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision-making process?\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has 12 members\u2014seven from the Board of Governors and five from regional Federal Reserve Banks\u2014who meet regularly to take a closer look at economic indicators. They use these indicators to help make decisions about monetary policy, such as whether or not to change the federal funds rate.\nThe key indicators that the Fed monitors are:\nThe role of the \u201cdot plot\u201d and forward guidance\nIn addition to current economic data, the FOMC also considers future expectations, known as the \u2018dot plot.\u2019 All twelve FOMC members submit their future projections for short- and long-term interest rates. This can help gauge the committee\u2019s views on the future of the economy and help guide the Fed\u2019s overall strategy.\u00a0\nForward guidance also helps the Fed signal future intentions. By communicating whether rates will go up or down in the near future, the Fed can guide future market behavior, aiming to provide some stability for the market. For example, if the Fed says rates are likely to stay low for a long time, a business might be more likely to invest because they know borrowing rates will be affordable.\u00a0\nThe Fed must balance economic growth while keeping inflation in check. It does this by making data-driven decisions based on factors like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior. In addition to these indicators, there are other considerations, like trade tensions, global events, and geopolitical risks. For example, the pandemic, the 2008 financial meltdown, and wars impacted the Fed\u2019s decisions.\nThe FOMC\u2019s decisions aren\u2019t safe from scrutiny\u2014they face this from the public, political leaders, and markets. Because the Federal Reserve is independent, it can focus on the economy\u2019s long-term health without the interference of short-term political pressure. However, its decisions have far-reaching effects on businesses, consumers, and the entire global economy.\nThe global influence of federal funds rate changes\nDecisions made by the Fed affect more than just the United States. In fact, they can impact the economy, markets, and central banks worldwide. The US dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency, and when the Fed makes policies, it also shapes global financial conditions.\u00a0\nWhen rates are raised or cut, there\u2019s a global chain reaction impacting everything from international trade to exchange rates to capital flows and foreign investment:\n2022-2024: Fed rate hikes & cuts\nThe Fed\u2019s rate policy from 2022 to 2024 marks a dramatic swing between aggressive hikes and easing measures. In 2022 and 2023, they raised rates at an unprecedented pace to cool the economy after supply chain issues and high consumer demand. By late 2023, rampant inflation showed signs of easing.\u00a0\nThen, at their meeting on September 18th, 2024, they enacted their first rate cut since the COVID-19 pandemic\u201450 basis points to help the weak labor market.\u00a0\nBy cutting rates in 2024, the Fed addressed concerns about slow economic growth, as well as rising unemployment. To prevent further deterioration of job gains and rising unemployment rates, the Fed aims to make borrowing more affordable for businesses and consumers. This encourages investments and spending, which can help create more jobs and stimulate the economy while keeping inflation manageable.\n2019-2020: Fed rate cuts\nGoing into 2020, the Fed cut rates to help stimulate the economy amidst global uncertainty. The end of 2019 marked concerns about trade tensions, with slow global growth and muted inflation, which prompted them to cut rates. But then the pandemic hit, causing them to shift from caution to emergency action. When the world shut down in March of 2020, in an unprecedented move to support the economy, the Fed slashed rates to nearly zero.\u00a0\nPaired with quantitative easing to mitigate any economic fallout once businesses started boarding up and unemployment soared, the Fed's actions were designed to flood the financial system with liquidity and encourage borrowing and spending. Cutting rates to almost zero, businesses could borrow for much cheaper than before, and allowed for consumers to finance large purchases.\u00a0\n2015-2018: Fed rate hikes\nIn the wake of near-zero rates after the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed raised rates in December 2015 for the first time since 2006. They were confident the US economy was starting to recover, thanks to steady job growth and more consumer spending. While these rate hikes were modest, they were scant for a reason: After years of extraordinary measures, they wanted to normalize the monetary policy. Then, by 2018, they'd raised the rates four times as the economy strengthened.\nHowever, by the end of 2018, a volatile market led to a more cautious stance by the Fed as trade tensions and slow global growth raised concerns about the sustainability of the economic expansion. Worried that the rate hikes could stifle any growth and propel the US into a deeper economic dive, they hit pause on tightening the economy.\n2007-2008: Fed rate cuts\nFinancial markets unraveled when the housing bubble burst, causing the Fed to make sharp rate cuts in 2007 and 2008. These were supposed to help cushion the U.S. economy amid the subprime mortgage crisis, but the response was a full-blown global financial meltdown.\u00a0\nThe Fed brought rates to near zero after cutting them from over 5% by the end of 2008. Amid bailouts and emergency lending to stabilize banks, they sought to prevent a deeper economic collapse. This period became known as The Great Recession.\u00a0\u00a0\n2005-2006: Fed rate hikes\nTo prevent the economy from overheating, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates in the mid-2000s. The economy was expanding and housing prices were surging, so the Fed made a series of rate hikes from 2005 to 2006. With potential speculation in the housing market and increasing inflation, the Fed sought to curb excessive borrowing and prevent the formation of asset bubbles by steadily raising interest rates. By December 2005, they'd raised rates for 13 straight times.\nThis made borrowing more expensive, which cooled the housing market and brought rising prices under control during this period of economic instability that ran rampant with unchecked inflation and speculative activity.\u00a0\n2001-2003: Fed rate cuts\nIn the early 2000s, the Federal Reserve had a lot to contend with\u2014the bursting of the dot-com bubble and the aftermath of September 11th. From 2001 to 2003, the Fed made a series of rate cuts to help stimulate an economy rocked by back-to-back crises. They slashed rates from 6.5% to 1% during this period to support growth and encourage more borrowing and investments. In 2001 alone, they cut rates 11 times.\nWhile these extended periods of rate cuts helped the economic slowdown, they also contributed to the eventual housing market bubble that led to the financial crisis in 2008.\n1999-2000: Fed rate hikes\nWith a growing technology sector and booming economic growth, the Fed raised rates in 1999 and 2000. This helped to control inflation, especially as tech stocks experienced rapid growth. They raised rates five times between 1999 and 2000 to prevent overheating the economy. However, with the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 and the following economic downturn, they shifted to cutting rates shortly afterward.\n1998: Fed rate cuts\nWith growing concerns over the global financial system, the Fed made a series of rate cuts in 1998. A major hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, collapsed around the same time as serious instability in worldwide markets, influenced by the Asian financial crisis. The Fed's aim was to prevent the US from sinking into a recession. Totaling 75 basis points, the three rate cuts helped stabilize the markets.\nThe Fed made these cuts to encourage borrowing and investments, and by the end of 1998, the economy was relatively strong despite what was happening in external markets. However, some economists suggest that this period of extended rate cuts helped contribute to the dot-com bubble bust in the following years.\n1997: Fed rate hike\nIn 1997, the Fed raised rates in response to strong economic growth and a tightening labor market. Unemployment fell to historic lows, and when inflationary pressure increased, the Fed hiked rates to prevent overheating the economy. While they wanted to keep the stock market rising and bolster the ongoing expansion, the Fed also had to keep inflation in check.\u00a0\nThey made just one rate increase in 1997 to maintain price stability and consumer confidence. Throughout the decade, they were careful to balance growth and inflationary pressures.\n1995-1996: Fed rate cuts\nThe U.S. saw an economic expansion following the 1990s recession, so the Fed cut rates in 1995 and 1996. Earlier in the decade, the Fed grew concerned that the economy was slowing, partly due to reduced inflationary pressure. They wanted to encourage borrowing and investing so the economy could expand even further. These cuts kept inflation under control and helped reignite growth.\nThis ushered the economy into continued prosperity in the late 1990s, thanks to steady growth, low inflation, and a strong labor market. However, critics argue that these low rates led to riskier financial markets that led to the dot-com bubble.\n1994-1995: Fed rate hikes\nTo combat inflation, the Federal Reserve went on an aggressive rate-hiking cycle in 1994. With rapid economic expansion and more inflationary pressure, the federal funds rate jumped from 3% to 6% between February 1994 and February 1995. This was to prevent the economy from overheating and curb inflation, especially as wages increased and the labor market tightened.\nWhile these hikes controlled inflation, they also slowed the economy down, especially as sectors like housing and manufacturing, which are more sensitive to interest rates, saw reduced demand due to higher borrowing costs. These made loans more expensive, so home sales dropped and industrial production slowed, leading to even more economic deceleration. By early 1995, the Fed paused these rate increases to help maintain long-term stability, which fueled the expansion in the late 1990s.\n1990-1992: Fed rate cuts\nA recession began in 1990, and to stimulate the economy, the Fed made a series of rate cuts. The savings and loan crisis, Gulf War oil prices, and slowing consumer spending combined to trigger this recession. The Fed brought the federal funds rate from 8% to 3% over a two-year period to help encourage borrowing and investing in a sluggish economy.\nThis laid the groundwork for the economic recovery experienced by the mid-90s, as it was cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow, so they were encouraged to spend more. Industries reliant on consumer credit, such as the real estate market, benefited from these lower rates. This gradual economic recovery took some time to come to fruition, though many agree the Fed's actions helped prevent a deeper, more prolonged recession.\nThe takeaway\nThe federal fund rate's history shows the tough balancing act that the Fed employs to sustain economic growth while controlling inflation. During periods of rapid growth, rate hikes help curb inflation, while during economic slowdowns, rate cuts help stimulate borrowing.\u00a0\nAs a consumer and investor, knowing when and why the Federal Reserve makes adjustments to the federal funds rates can help you decide when to borrow, invest, and save. For example, if rates are high, you might want to wait to refinance your mortgage, but it might be an excellent time to stash some cash in a high-yield savings account or CD.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the Federal Reserve?\nThe Federal Reserve oversees the United States' monetary policy as the central banking system. It regulates financial institutions, works to maintain economic stability, and manages the nation's money supply.\nWhat does the Federal Reserve do?\nThe Federal Reserve controls interest rates, works to keep inflation in check, and tries to stabilize the financial system. It also supervises banks, provides financial services to the US government, and is a lender during financial crises.\nWhy was the Federal Reserve created?\nThe Federal Reserve was formed in 1913 to provide a more stable banking system and to help stem financial panics like the one that caused the Panic of 1907. This saw widespread bank runs and deteriorated confidence in the economic system. This central authority to manage monetary policy and give emergency support to banks helped create a more resilient financial environment.\nRead more\nKatherine Haan is a former financial advisor turned small business coach.

    "Summarized_document": "The federal funds rate, set by the Federal Reserve (the Fed), is a crucial tool for stabilizing the economy during periods of growth and recession. The Fed adjusts this rate in response to major events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis, to influence borrowing costs and consumer spending. When the economy overheats, the Fed raises rates to curb inflation, making borrowing more expensive. Conversely, during recessions, it lowers rates to encourage borrowing and spending.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), consisting of 12 members, uses economic indicators like inflation, employment, GDP, and consumer behavior to guide rate decisions. They also consider future expectations through the 'dot plot' and forward guidance, which help signal future rate changes to stabilize markets.\n\nThe Fed's rate decisions have global implications, affecting international trade, exchange rates, and foreign investment due to the US dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. From 2022 to 2024, the Fed's policy shifted from aggressive rate hikes to cuts, responding to economic conditions like inflation and unemployment.\n\nHistorically, the Fed has adjusted rates in response to various economic challenges:\n- **2022-2024:** Aggressive rate hikes followed by cuts to address inflation and unemployment.\n- **2019-2020:** Rate cuts to stimulate the economy amid global uncertainty and the pandemic.\n- **2015-2018:** Gradual rate hikes as the economy recovered from the 2008 crisis.\n- **2007-2008:** Sharp rate cuts during the financial crisis.\n- **2005-2006:** Rate hikes to prevent economic overheating.\n- **2001-2003:** Rate cuts following the dot-com bubble and 9/11.\n- **1999-2000:** Rate hikes to control inflation during tech sector growth.\n- **1998:** Rate cuts to stabilize markets during global financial instability.\n- **1997:** A rate hike in response to strong economic growth.\n- **1995-1996:** Rate cuts to encourage borrowing and investment.\n- **1994-1995:** Aggressive rate hikes to combat inflation.\n- **1990-1992:** Rate cuts to stimulate the economy during a recession.\n\nUnderstanding the Fed's rate decisions can help consumers and investors make informed financial choices, such as when to borrow or invest. The Federal Reserve, established in 1913, aims to maintain economic stability and manage the nation's money supply, providing a more resilient financial environment."

Thanks to September's gains, the S&P 500 has posted its strongest first three quarters of the 21st century.\nEquities were given a lift this month by the Federal Reserve, which joined the ranks of global central banks easing monetary policy when it cut interest rates\u2014by 50 basis points\u2014for the first time in four years. The cut, according to officials, was a preemptive step to support the labor market, which data suggests is cooling but not falling apart.\nThe fourth quarter is historically a strong one for stocks, and analysts\u2014despite noting the likelihood of elevated volatility\u2014are broadly optimistic about the outlook.\nThe Labor Market in Focus\nAs in the third quarter, the economy is likely to be top of mind for investors throughout the fourth quarter. Wall Street will especially be looking at labor market data for evidence of deterioration that would worry the Fed.\nInitial unemployment claims will be a key data point to keep an eye on, according to analysts at Russell Investments. Claims data, which is released weekly, has less of a lag than other labor market data. \"These will provide the clearest real-time guidance on whether the U.S. economy is rebalancing or drifting towards recession,\" they say.\nInitial claims sustainably above 260,000 per week would be a red flag, in their view. The four-week average as of late September stood at about 225,000.\nFed officials, in their most recent economic projections, penciled in another half-percentage-point cut from interest rates this year. An uptick in unemployment coupled with job losses could spur the Fed into more aggressive action at one of its two policy meetings. That would bring interest rates more in line with market expectations, but would likely also spook investors and do some damage to stock portfolios.\nSoft Landing Seen Good for Stocks\nThe consensus on Wall Street is that the Fed is likely on track to achieve the soft landing it's been chasing for years, which bodes well for stocks.\nAs of late September, the Atlanta Fed\u2019s GDPNow calculator estimated the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.1% in the third quarter.\nSix of the last 10 rate-cutting cycles coincided with recessions. In those instances, the S&P 500 fell on average in the year after the first cut. In the four cycles that coincided with soft landings, the average return was in the high teens.\nConventional wisdom says that small-cap stocks should benefit most from interest-rate cuts since they are more likely to have floating-rate debt. However, BlackRock analysts found that large caps have outperformed small caps during rate-cutting cycles since 1984, and that the outperformance is most pronounced outside of recessions.\nAt the sector level, healthcare and consumer staples have performed the best during rate cuts, while communication services and tech have been the worst performers.\nThe S&P 500, excluding the Magnificent Seven, in the second quarter grew aggregate earnings for the first time since 2022. Third-quarter results, which companies will begin reporting in mid-October, are expected to show the profitability gap between tech mega caps and the rest of the market is continuing to narrow.\nThe Mag 7, meanwhile, faces the challenge of convincing Wall Street that their massive investments in artificial intelligence (AI) will pay off. They struggled to do so over the summer, sparking selloffs that the group has yet to fully rebound from. These stocks could continue to face pressure if their earnings fail to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations.\nPolitics Could Stoke Volatility\nPolitical developments are likely to amplify stock volatility through the rest of the year, even if they don\u2019t fundamentally change the economic or business outlook.\nThe presidential election in November is one such event that could deliver Wall Street a short-term shock. BlackRock analysis found that, more often than not, the market's knee-jerk reaction to a presidential election is not indicative of its performance over the next year. Still, the presidential candidates have staked out positions on tariffs and corporate taxes that, if enacted, would surely change the outlook for U.S. businesses.\nConflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine could also keep the stock market on edge as long as they threaten to disrupt global trade or roil energy markets.\nExperts note, however, that volatility is a two-way street that can provide canny investors with opportunities to buy stocks at attractive valuations. Heightened volatility can also turbocharge short-term returns. Since 1990, the S&P 500 has returned 16% on average in the six months after the Cboe Volatility Index has risen to 29 or higher, compared with an average return of 5% in less volatile periods.\nDo you have a news tip for Investopedia reporters?

    "Summarized_document": "The document provides a comprehensive list of match ratings for Lionel Messi, sourced from WhoScored, SofaScore, and FotMob. These ratings are crucial for analyzing player performance metrics in sports performance analytics. The ratings are based on Opta stats, which are reviewed after each game, and may be subject to change. The ratings include both overall scores and Man of the Match (MOTM) distinctions. For matches not covered by WhoScored, SofaScore or FotMob ratings are used, which also rely on Opta stats. SofaScore includes an additional metric called 'Second Assist,' which accounts for passes that create opportunities for another player to assist a goal. This document is part of a larger analysis comparing Messi and Ronaldo, with illustrations by Denis Davydov. The document emphasizes the importance of accurate numerical data in evaluating player performance, as these metrics are essential for generating mathematical reasoning problems in sports analytics."

    "Summarized_document": "Stephen Curry led the Golden State Warriors to a 115-97 victory over the Charlotte Hornets, scoring 23 points, including four 3-pointers, in his annual homecoming game. Curry, who grew up in Charlotte and played at Davidson College, contributed 12 points in the decisive third quarter. This win marked the Warriors' third consecutive victory and Curry's first win in Charlotte in five years. Andrew Wiggins supported with 20 points, eight rebounds, and eight assists, while Trayce Jackson-Davis added 18 points. The Warriors, currently 10th in the Western Conference, are competing with the Houston Rockets for a play-in tournament spot. The Rockets, who won their 11th straight game, are just one game behind the Warriors. Warriors coach Steve Kerr noted the competitiveness of the Western Conference, comparing it to last season when a similar record secured the sixth seed. Golden State's defense limited Charlotte to 41% shooting, marking their third consecutive game holding opponents under 100 points. Miles Bridges led Charlotte with 22 points and nine rebounds. Despite the absence of Klay Thompson due to knee tendinitis, Chris Paul stepped up with 11 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists. The Warriors capitalized on Charlotte's defensive lapses, finding open players for easy baskets. Curry, watched by his family, expressed his commitment to staying with the Warriors despite the allure of playing for the Hornets, where his father Dell was a star. The Warriors will next face the Spurs, while the Hornets will host the Clippers."

With the Timberwolves holding the third spot in the Western Conference standings, securing a win was crucial for the Warriors, who are at risk of losing their position in the NBA Play-In Tournament.\nDespite the pressure, the Warriors displayed resilience in the first quarter, establishing a 27-18 lead over the Wolves. Veteran players Draymond Green and Klay Thompson set the tone for Golden State in the opening period, with Green contributing seven points and Thompson adding five.\nChris Paul and Gary Payton II showcased their playmaking skills for the Warriors in the first quarter, tallying four and three assists, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry ignited the second quarter after a slow start, pouring in 11 points to bolster the Warriors' lead to 54-46 at halftime.

Chris Paul and Klay Thompson also provided support with five points each, helping the Warriors retain control of the game.\nHowever, the Timberwolves completed the comeback, securing a 114-110 victory.

While they still hold the 10th spot in the Western Conference, which makes them qualified for the NBA Play-In Tournament, they are on the verge of losing their place to the Houston Rockets (35-35).\nThe Rockets are currently on an eight-game winning streak. If Houston manages to extend their win streak to nine consecutive games, Golden State could lose their spot in the upcoming postseason.\nGolden State Warriors playoffs picture: Remaining schedule\nIt's going to be a challenging road ahead for the Golden State Warriors with only 12 games remaining in their regular season. The Warriors are next scheduled to face the Miami Heat (39-32) on Tuesday. This is a tricky situation for the \"Dubs\" as the Heat are also looking to improve their record and get out of the Play-In Tournament picture. With Miami only one game behind the sixth-placed Indiana Pacers, Florida's own will likely be going full throttle to secure a Playoff spot.\nAfter going up against last year's NBA Finals runners-up, the Warriors will need to deal with the Orlando Magic (42-29) next. Based on how the Magic have played so far this year, they've proven they have what it takes to keep up with the contenders in the league. Paolo Banchero has remarkably carried his team, which is why he got his first All-Star selection this year.\nThe Golden State Warriors will need to take full advantage of their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets (17-53) and San Antonio Spurs (15-56) after facing the two top teams in the Eastern Conference.
